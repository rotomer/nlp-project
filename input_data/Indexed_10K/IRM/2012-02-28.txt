The impact to income from continuing operations and net income is a reduction of $1,328, $2,188, $2,927 and $3,686, respectively, for the after tax impact of the revenue errors for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. (2)Prior to January 1, 2010, the financial position and results of operations of the operating subsidiaries of Iron Mountain Europe (Group) Limited (collectively referred to as "IME"), our European business, were consolidated based on IMEs fiscal year ended October 31. Effective January 1, 2010, we changed the fiscal year end (and the reporting period for consolidation purposes) of IME to coincide with Iron Mountain Incorporateds fiscal year end of December 31. We believe that the change in accounting principle related to the elimination of the two month reporting lag for IME is preferable because it will result in more contemporaneous reporting of events and results related to IME. In accordance with applicable accounting literature, a change in subsidiary year end is treated as a change in accounting principle and requires retrospective application. The impact of the change was not material to the results of operations for the previously reported annual and interim periods after January 1, 2007, and, thus, those results have not been revised. There is, however, a charge of $4.7 million recorded to other (income) expense, net in the year ended December 31, 2010 to recognize the immaterial difference arising from the change. There were no significant infrequent or unusual items in the IME two month period ended December 31, 2008 and 2009. (3)For the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of $85,909 related to our technology escrow services business, which we continue to own and operate 28 Table of Contents and which was previously reflected in the former worldwide digital business segment and is now reflected as a component of the North American Business segment. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded a $197,876 non cash goodwill impairment charge related to our former worldwide digital business that is included in loss from discontinued operations, net of tax. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of $46,500 in our Western Europe reporting unit, which is a component of the International Business segment. See Note 2.g. to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (4)In February 2010, our board of directors adopted a dividend policy under which we began paying quarterly dividends on our common stock. See "Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities." (5)Adjusted OIBDA is defined as operating income before depreciation, amortization, intangible impairments and (gain) loss on disposal/write down of property, plant and equipment, net. Adjusted OIBDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted OIBDA by total revenues. For a more detailed definition and reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA and a discussion of why we believe these measures provide relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors, see "Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Non GAAP Measures."  Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with "Item 6. Selected Financial Data" and the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto and the other financial and operating information included elsewhere in this filing. This discussion contains "forward looking statements" as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and in other federal securities laws. See "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements" on page ii of this filing and "Item 1A. Risk Factors" beginning on page 15 of this filing. Overview In August 2010, we divested the domain name management product line (the "Domain Name Product Line") of our digital business. On June 2, 2011, we completed the sale (the "Digital Sale") of our online backup and recovery, digital archiving and eDiscovery solutions businesses (the "Digital Business") to Autonomy, pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement dated as of May 15, 2011 among Iron Mountain Incorporated ("IMI"), certain subsidiaries of IMI and Autonomy (the "Digital Sale Agreement"). In the Digital Sale, Autonomy purchased (i) the shares of certain of IMIs subsidiaries through which IMI conducted the Digital Business and (ii) certain assets of IMI and its subsidiaries relating to our Digital Business. The financial position, operating results and cash flows of the Domain Name Product Line and the Digital Business, for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, including the gains on the sales, have been reported as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes. IMI retained its technology escrow services business which had previously been reported in the former worldwide digital business segment along with the Digital Business and the Domain Name Product Line. The technology escrow services business is now reported in the North American Business segment. Additionally, on October 3, 2011, we sold our records management business in New Zealand (the "New Zealand Business"). The financial position, operating results and cash flows of the New Zealand Business, including the gain on the sale, for all periods presented, have been reported as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes. Also, in December 2011, we committed to a plan to sell the Italian Business. The financial position, operating results and cash flows of the Italian Business, for all periods presented, have been reported as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes. See Note 14 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 29  Table of Contents Consolidated statements of operations amounts for 2009 and 2010 were restated in connection with the government contract billing error more fully discussed in Notes 2.y. and 10.h. to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result, 2009 and 2010 consolidated statements of operations amounts related to: (a) storage, (b) service, (c) total revenues, (d) operating income, (e) income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes, (f) provision for income taxes, (g) income from continuing operations, (h) net income (loss) and (g) net income (loss) attributable to Iron Mountain Incorporated have been changed throughout managements discussion and analysis to conform to the restated figures. Our revenues consist of storage revenues as well as service revenues. Storage revenues, which are considered a key performance indicator for the information management services industry, consist primarily of recurring periodic charges related to the storage of materials or data (generally on a per unit basis) that are typically retained by customers for many years and have accounted for over 55% of total consolidated revenues in each of the last three years. Our annual revenues from these fixed periodic storage fees have grown for 23 consecutive years. Service revenues are comprised of charges for related core service activities and a wide array of complementary products and services. Included in core service revenues are: (1) the handling of records, including the addition of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records and the destruction of records; (2) courier operations, consisting primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request; (3) secure shredding of sensitive documents; and (4) other recurring services, including hybrid services and recurring project revenues. Our complementary services revenues include special project work, customer termination and permanent withdrawal fees, data restoration projects, fulfillment services, consulting services, technology services and product sales (including specially designed storage containers and related supplies). A by product of our secure shredding and destruction services is the sale of recycled paper (included in complementary services revenues), the price of which can fluctuate from period to period, adding to the volatility and reducing the predictability of that revenue stream. Our consolidated revenues are also subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenue derived from outside the U.S. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, we derived approximately 31%, 32% and 34%, respectively, of our total revenues from outside the U.S. We recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Storage and service revenues are recognized in the month the respective storage or service is provided, and customers are generally billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed upon terms. Amounts related to future storage or prepaid service contracts for customers where storage fees or services are billed in advance are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the applicable storage or service period or when the service is performed. Revenue from the sales of products, which is included as a component of service revenues, is recognized when products are shipped to the customer and title has passed to the customer. Revenues from the sales of products have historically not been significant. Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) consists primarily of wages and benefits for field personnel, facility occupancy costs (including rent and utilities), transportation expenses (including vehicle leases and fuel), other product cost of sales and other equipment costs and supplies. Of these, wages and benefits and facility occupancy costs are the most significant. Trends in total wages and benefits in dollars and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance and workers compensation. Trends in facility occupancy costs are impacted by the total number of facilities we occupy, the mix of properties we own versus properties we occupy under operating leases, fluctuations in per square foot occupancy costs, and the levels of utilization of these properties. 30 Table of Contents The expansion of our European and secure shredding businesses has impacted the major cost of sales components. Our European operations are more labor intensive than our North American businesses and, therefore, add incremental labor costs at a higher percentage of segment revenue than our North American business. Our secure shredding operations incur lower facility costs and higher transportation costs as a percentage of revenues compared to our core physical businesses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for management, administrative, information technology, sales, account management and marketing personnel, as well as expenses related to communications and data processing, travel, professional fees, bad debts, training, office equipment and supplies. Trends in total wage and benefit dollars as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance. The overhead structure of our expanding European and Asian operations, as compared to our North American operations, is more labor intensive and has not achieved the same level of overhead leverage, which may result in an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of consolidated revenue, as our European and Asian operations become a more meaningful percentage of our consolidated results. Our depreciation and amortization charges result primarily from the capital intensive nature of our business. The principal components of depreciation relate to storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings. Amortization relates primarily to customer relationship acquisition costs and is impacted by the nature and timing of acquisitions. In September 2011, as a result of certain changes we made in the manner in which our European operations are managed, we reorganized our reporting structure and reassigned goodwill among the revised reporting units. As a result of the management and reporting changes, we concluded that we have three reporting units for our European operations: (1) the United Kingdom, Ireland and Norway ("UKI"); (2) Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Spain ("Western Europe"); and (3) the remaining countries in Europe ("Central Europe"). Due to these changes, we will perform all future goodwill impairment analysis on the new reporting unit basis. As a result of the restructuring of our reporting units, we concluded that we had an interim triggering event, and, therefore, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test for UKI, Western Europe and Central Europe in the third quarter of 2011 as of August 31, 2011. As required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), prior to our goodwill impairment analysis, we performed an impairment assessment on the long lived assets within our UKI, Western Europe and Central Europe reporting units and noted no impairment, except for the Italian Business, which was included in our Western Europe reporting unit, and which is now included in discontinued operations. See Note 14 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Based on our analyses, we concluded that the goodwill of our UKI and Central Europe reporting units was not impaired. Our UKI and Central Europe reporting units had fair values that exceed their carrying values by 15.1% and 4.9%, respectively, as of August 31, 2011. Central Europe is still in the investment stage, and, accordingly, its fair value does not exceed its carrying value by a significant margin at this point in time. A deterioration of the UKI or Central Europe businesses or their failure to achieve the forecasted results could lead to impairments in future periods. Our Western Europe reporting units fair value was less than its carrying value, and, as a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $46.5 million included as a component of intangible impairments from continuing operations in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011. A tax benefit of approximately $5.4 million was recorded associated with the Western Europe goodwill impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2011 and is included in the provision from income taxes from continuing operations. During the quarter ended September 30, 2010, prior to our annual goodwill impairment review, we concluded that events occurred and circumstances changed in our former worldwide digital business 31 Table of Contents reporting unit that required us to conduct an impairment review. The primary factors contributing to our conclusion that we had a triggering event and a requirement to reassess our former worldwide digital business reporting unit goodwill for impairment included: (1) a reduction in forecasted revenue and operating results due to continued pressure on key parts of the business as a result of the weak economy; (2) reduced revenue and profit outlook for our eDiscovery service due to smaller average matter size and lower pricing; (3) a decision to discontinue certain software development projects; and (4) the sale of the Domain Name Product Line. As a result of the review, we recorded a provisional goodwill impairment charge associated with our former worldwide digital business reporting unit in the amount of $255.0 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2010. We finalized the estimate in the fourth quarter of 2010, and we recorded an additional impairment of $28.8 million, for a total goodwill impairment charge of $283.8 million. Based on a relative fair value basis, we allocated $85.9 million of this charge to the retained technology escrow services business which continues to be included in our continuing results of operations. Our technology escrow services business had previously been reported in the former worldwide digital business segment along with the Digital Business and the Domain Name Product Line. The technology escrow services business is now reported in the North American Business segment. Our consolidated revenues and expenses are subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenues and expenses incurred by our entities outside the U.S. In 2009, we saw decreases in both revenues and expenses as a result of the weakening of the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar and the Euro against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average exchange rates for the comparable periods. In 2010, we saw increases in both revenues and expenses as a result of the strengthening of the British pound sterling and the Canadian dollar, slightly offset by a weakening of the Euro, against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average exchange rates for the comparable periods. In 2011, we saw increases in both revenues and expenses as a result of the strengthening of the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Euro, against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average exchange rates for the comparable periods. It is difficult to predict how much foreign currency exchange rates will fluctuate in the future and how those fluctuations will impact our consolidated statement of operations. Due to the expansion of our international operations, these fluctuations have become material on individual balances. However, because both the revenues and expenses are denominated in the local currency of the country in which they are derived or incurred, the impact of currency fluctuations on our operating income and operating margin is partially mitigated. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we compare the percentage change in the results from one period to another period in this report using constant currency disclosure. The constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the 2009 results at the 2010 average exchange rates and the 2010 results at the 2011 average exchange rates. Prior to January 1, 2010, the financial position and results of operations of the operating subsidiaries of IME, our European business, were consolidated based on IMEs fiscal year ended October 31. Effective January 1, 2010, we changed the fiscal year end (and the reporting period for consolidation purposes) of IME to coincide with IMIs fiscal year end of December 31. We believe that the change in accounting principle related to the elimination of the two month reporting lag for IME is preferable because it results in more contemporaneous reporting of events and results related to IME. In accordance with applicable accounting literature, a change in a subsidiarys year end is treated as a change in accounting principle and requires retrospective application. The impact of the change was not material to the results of operations for the previously reported annual and interim periods prior to January 1, 2010, and, thus, those results have not been revised. There is, however, a charge of $4.7 million recorded to other (income) expense, net in the year ended December 31, 2010 to recognize the immaterial differences arising from the change. 32 Table of Contents The following table is a comparison of underlying average exchange rates of the foreign currencies that had the most significant impact on our U.S. dollar reported revenues and expenses: Average Exchange Rates for the Year Ended December 31, Percentage Strengthening/ (Weakening) of Foreign Currency 2010 2011 British pound sterling $ 1.546 $ 1.604 3.8 % Canadian dollar $ 0.971 $ 1.012 4.2 % Euro $ 1.328 $ 1.392 4.8 % Average Exchange Rates for the Year Ended December 31, Percentage Strengthening/ (Weakening) of Foreign Currency 2009(1) 2010 British pound sterling $ 1.544 $ 1.546 0.1 % Canadian dollar $ 0.880 $ 0.971 10.3 % Euro $ 1.366 $ 1.328 (2.8 )% (1)Corresponding to the appropriate periods based on the operating subsidiaries of IMEs fiscal year ended October 31. Non GAAP Measures Adjusted Operating Income Before Depreciation, Amortization and Intangible Impairments ("Adjusted OIBDA") Adjusted OIBDA is defined as operating income before depreciation, amortization, intangible impairments and (gain) loss on disposal/write down of property, plant and equipment, net. Adjusted OIBDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted OIBDA by total revenues. We use multiples of current or projected Adjusted OIBDA in conjunction with our discounted cash flow models to determine our overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. We believe Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Margin provide current and potential investors with relevant and useful information regarding our ability to generate cash flow to support business investment. These measures are an integral part of the internal reporting system we use to assess and evaluate the operating performance of our business. Adjusted OIBDA does not include certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results, specifically: (1) (gain) and loss on disposal/write down of property, plant and equipment, net; (2) intangible impairments; (3) other expense (income), net; (4) cumulative effect of change in accounting principle; (5) income (loss) from discontinued operations; (6) gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations; and (7) net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. Adjusted OIBDA also does not include interest expense, net and the provision (benefit) for income taxes. These expenses are associated with our capitalization and tax structures, which we do not consider when evaluating the operating profitability of our core operations. Finally, Adjusted OIBDA does not include depreciation and amortization expenses in order to eliminate the impact of capital investments, which we evaluate by comparing capital expenditures to incremental revenue generated and as a percentage of total revenues. Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Margin should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP, such as operating or net income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations (as determined in accordance with GAAP). 33 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to Operating Income; Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income (Loss) (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Adjusted OIBDA $ 676,165 $ 754,279 $ 822,579 $ 926,676 $ 934,912 Less: Depreciation and Amortization 220,217 254,497 277,186 304,205 319,499 Intangible Impairments 85,909 46,500 Loss (Gain) on Disposal/Write Down of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net (5,463 ) 7,522 168 (10,987 ) (2,286 ) Operating Income 461,411 492,260 545,225 547,549 571,199 Less: Interest Expense, Net 214,147 219,989 212,545 204,559 205,256 Other (Income) Expense, Net 4,103 31,505 (12,599 ) 8,768 13,043 Provision for Income Taxes 72,617 146,122 113,762 167,483 106,488 Income from Continuing Operations 170,544 94,644 231,517 166,739 246,412 Total (Loss) Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax (17,858 ) (14,889 ) (12,138 ) (219,417 ) 153,180 Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 920 (94 ) 1,429 4,908 4,054 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Iron Mountain Incorporated $ 151,766 $ 79,849 $ 217,950 $ (57,586 ) $ 395,538 Free Cash Flows before Acquisitions and Discretionary Investments ("FCF") FCF is defined as Cash Flows from Operating Activities Continuing Operations less capital expenditures (excluding real estate), net of proceeds from the sales of property and equipment and other, net, and additions to customer relationship and acquisition costs. Our management uses this measure when evaluating the operating performance of our consolidated business. We believe this measure provides relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors. FCF is a useful measure in determining our ability to generate excess cash that may be used for reinvestment in the business, discretionary deployment in investments such as real estate or acquisition opportunities, returning of capital to our stockholders and voluntary prepayments of indebtedness. 34 Table of Contents Reconciliation of FCF to Cash Flows from Operating Activities Continuing Operations (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Free Cash Flows before Acquisitions and Discretionary Investments $ 168,196 $ 196,522 $ 330,142 $ 370,128 $ 457,838 Add: Capital Expenditures (excluding real estate), net(1) 298,158 303,236 245,687 219,899 183,973 Additions to Customer Relationship and Acquisitions Costs 16,384 14,141 10,741 13,202 21,703 Cash Flows From Operating Activities Continuing Operations $ 482,738 $ 513,899 $ 586,570 $ 603,229 $ 663,514 Cash Flows From Investing Activities Continuing Operations $ (700,689 ) $ (421,480 ) $ (298,699 ) $ (298,458 ) $ (302,213 ) Cash Flows From Financing Activities Continuing Operations $ 461,570 $ 87,028 $ (128,286 ) $ (379,711 ) $ (762,670 ) (1)The 2010 results included approximately $11,000 incurred by IME in November and December 2009 prior to the change in its fiscal year end. Adjusted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations ("Adjusted EPS") Adjusted EPS from continuing operations is defined as reported earnings per share from continuing operations excluding: (a) (gain) loss on the disposal/write down of property, plant and equipment, net; (b) intangible impairments; (c) other expense (income), net; and (d) the tax impact of reconciling items and discrete tax items. We do not believe these excluded items to be indicative of our ongoing operating results, and they are not considered when we are forecasting our future results. We believe Adjusted EPS from continuing operations is of value to investors when comparing our results from past, present and future periods.

The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of 35 Table of Contents contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for the period then ended. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the estimates used. We base our estimates on historical experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Our critical accounting policies include the following, which are listed in no particular order: Revenue Recognition Our revenues consist of storage revenues as well as service revenues and are reflected net of sales and value added taxes. Storage revenues, which are considered a key performance indicator for the information management services industry, consist primarily of recurring periodic charges related to the storage of materials or data (generally on a per unit basis). Service revenues are comprised of charges for related core service activities and a wide array of complementary products and services. Included in core service revenues are: (1) the handling of records, including the addition of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refilling of removed records and the destruction of records; (2) courier operations, consisting primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request; (3) secure shredding of sensitive documents; and (4) other recurring services, including hybrid services and recurring project revenues. Our complementary services revenues include special project work, customer termination and permanent withdrawal fees, data restoration projects, fulfillment services, consulting services, technology services and product sales (including specially designed storage containers and related supplies). A by product of our secure shredding and destruction services is the sale of recycled paper (included in complementary services revenues), the price of which can fluctuate from period to period, adding to the volatility and reducing the predictability of that revenue stream. We recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Storage and service revenues are recognized in the month the respective storage or service is provided, and customers are generally billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed upon terms. Amounts related to future storage or prepaid service contracts for customers where storage fees or services are billed in advance are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the applicable storage or service period or when the service is performed. Revenue from the sales of products, which is included as a component of service revenues, is recognized when products are shipped to the customer and title has passed to the customer. Revenues from the sales of products have historically not been significant. Accounting for Acquisitions Part of our growth strategy has included the acquisition of numerous businesses. The purchase price of each acquisition has been determined after due diligence of the acquired business, market research, strategic planning and the forecasting of expected future results and synergies. Estimated future results and expected synergies are subject to revisions as we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources. Each acquisition has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting as defined under the applicable accounting standards at the date of each acquisition. Accounting for these acquisitions has resulted in the capitalization of the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets acquired in each of these acquisitions as goodwill. We estimated the fair values of the assets acquired in each acquisition as of the date of acquisition and these estimates are subject to adjustment based on the final assessments of the fair value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, operating leases and deferred income taxes. We complete these assessments within one year of the date of acquisition. See Note 6 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 36 Table of Contents Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Credit Memos We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments and potential disputes regarding billing and service issues. When calculating the allowance, we consider our past loss experience, current and prior trends in our aged receivables and credit memo activity, current economic conditions and specific circumstances of individual receivable balances. If the financial condition of our customers were to significantly change, resulting in a significant improvement or impairment of their ability to make payments, an adjustment of the allowance may be required. We consider accounts receivable to be delinquent after such time as reasonable means of collection have been exhausted. We charge off uncollectible balances as circumstances warrant, generally no later than one year past due. As of December 31, 2010 and 2011, our allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos balance totaled $20.7 million and $23.3 million, respectively. Impairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets Assets subject to amortization: We review long lived assets and all amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate to their carrying amount. The operations are generally distinguished by the business segment and geographic region in which they operate. If the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets, then intangible assets are written down first, followed by the other long lived assets of the operation, to fair value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending upon the nature of the assets. Goodwill Assets not subject to amortization: Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We have selected October 1 as our annual goodwill impairment review date. We performed our annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2009, 2010 and 2011 and noted no impairment of goodwill. However, as a result of interim triggering events as discussed below, we recorded provisional goodwill impairment charges in each of the third quarters of 2010 and 2011 in conjunction with the Digital Sale and associated with our European operations, respectively. These provisional goodwill impairment charges were finalized in the fourth quarters of the 2010 and 2011 fiscal years, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, no factors were identified that would alter our October 1, 2011 goodwill assessment. In making this assessment, we relied on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, anticipated future cash flows, transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. When changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units, the goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values. During the quarter ended September 30, 2010, prior to our annual goodwill impairment review, we concluded that events occurred and circumstances changed in our former worldwide digital business reporting unit that required us to conduct an impairment review. The primary factors contributing to our conclusion that we had a triggering event and a requirement to reassess our former worldwide digital business reporting unit goodwill for impairment included: (1) a reduction in forecasted revenue and operating results due to continued pressure on key parts of the business as a result of the weak economy; (2) reduced revenue and profit outlook for our eDiscovery service due to smaller average matter size and lower pricing; (3) a decision to discontinue certain software development projects; and (4) the sale of the Domain Name Product Line. As a result of the review, we recorded a provisional goodwill impairment charge associated with our former worldwide digital business reporting unit in the amount of $255.0 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2010. We finalized the estimate in the fourth quarter of 2010, and we recorded an additional impairment of $28.8 million, for a total 37 Table of Contents goodwill impairment charge of $283.8 million. For the year ended December 31, 2010, based on a relative fair value basis, we allocated $85.9 million of this charge to the retained technology escrow services business which continues to be included in our continuing results of operations. The technology escrow services business had previously been reported in the former worldwide digital business segment along with the Digital Business and the Domain Name Product Line and is now reported in the North American Business segment. In September 2011, as a result of certain changes we made in the manner in which our European operations are managed, we reorganized our reporting structure and reassigned goodwill among the revised reporting units. Previously, we tested goodwill impairment at the European level on a combined basis. As a result of the management and reporting changes, we concluded that we have three reporting units for our European operations: (1) UKI; (2) Western Europe; and (3) Central Europe. Due to these changes, we will perform all future goodwill impairment analyses on the new reporting unit basis. As a result of the restructuring of our reporting units, we concluded that we had an interim triggering event, and, therefore, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test for UKI, Western Europe and Central Europe in the third quarter of 2011 as of August 31, 2011. As required by GAAP, prior to our goodwill impairment analysis, we performed an impairment assessment on the long lived assets within our UKI, Western Europe and Central Europe reporting units and noted no impairment, except for the Italian Business, which was included in our Western Europe reporting unit, and which is now included in discontinued operations as discussed at Note 14 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Based on our analyses, we concluded that the goodwill of our UKI and Central Europe reporting units was not impaired. Our UKI and Central Europe reporting units had fair values that exceed their carrying values by 15.1% and 4.9%, respectively, as of August 31, 2011. Central Europe is still in the investment stage, and, accordingly, its fair value does not exceed its carrying value by a significant margin at this point in time. A deterioration of the UKI or Central Europe businesses or their failure to achieve the forecasted results could lead to impairments in future periods. Our Western Europe reporting units fair value was less than its carrying value, and, as a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $46.5 million included as a component of intangible impairments from continuing operations in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011. A tax benefit of approximately $5.4 million was recorded associated with the Western Europe goodwill impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2011 and is included in the provision for income taxes from continuing operations. Our reporting units at which level we performed our goodwill impairment analysis as of October 1, 2010 were as follows: North America; Europe; Latin America; Australia; Joint Ventures (which includes India, the various joint ventures in Southeast Asia and Russia (referred to as "Joint Ventures")); and Business Process Management ("BPM"). Given their similar economic characteristics, products, customers and processes, (1) the United Kingdom, Ireland and Norway and (2) the countries of Continental Europe (excluding Joint Ventures), each a reporting unit, have been aggregated as Europe and tested as one for goodwill impairment. As of December 31, 2010, the carrying value of goodwill, net amounted to $1,750.4 million, $438.3 million, $29.8 million and $61.0 million for North America, Europe, Latin America and Australia, respectively. Our Joint Ventures and BPM reporting units had no goodwill as of December 31, 2010. Our reporting units at which level we performed our goodwill impairment analysis as of October 1, 2011 were as follows: North America; UKI; Western Europe; Central Europe; Latin America; Australia; and Joint Ventures. As of December 31, 2011, the carrying value of goodwill, net amounted to $1,748.9 million, $306.2 million, $46.4 million, $63.8 million, $27.3 million, and $61.7 million for North America, UKI, Western Europe, Central Europe, Latin America and Australia, respectively. Our Joint Ventures reporting unit has no goodwill as of December 31, 2011. Our North America, Latin America and Australia reporting units had estimated fair values as of October 1, 2011 that exceeded their carrying value by greater than 40%. 38 Table of Contents Reporting unit valuations have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit or a combined approach based on the present value of future cash flows and market and transaction multiples of revenues and earnings. The income approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors, expected capital expenditures and income tax cash flows. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. In conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment reviews, we reconcile the sum of the valuations of all of our reporting units to our market capitalization as of such dates. Accounting for Internal Use Software We develop various software applications for internal use. Computer software costs associated with internal use software are expensed as incurred until certain capitalization criteria are met. Payroll and related costs for employees who are directly associated with, and who devote time to, the development of internal use computer software projects (to the extent time is spent directly on the project) are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the software. Capitalization begins when the design stage of the application has been completed and it is probable that the application will be completed and used to perform the function intended. Depreciation begins when the software is placed in service. Computer software costs that are capitalized are periodically evaluated for impairment. It may be necessary for us to write off amounts associated with the development of internal use software if the project cannot be completed as intended. We may be required to write off unamortized costs or shorten the estimated useful life if an internal use software program is replaced with an alternative tool prior to the end of the softwares estimated useful life. Capitalized labor net of accumulated depreciation was $33.7 million as of both December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. See Note 2.f. to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2011, we wrote off $0.6 million (primarily in Corporate) and $3.5 million (approximately $3.1 million associated with our International Business segment and approximately $0.4 million associated with our North American Business segment), respectively, of previously deferred software costs associated with internal use software development projects that were discontinued after implementation, which resulted in a loss on disposal/write down of property, plant and equipment, net in each of these years. Income Taxes We recorded a valuation allowance, amounting to $72.2 million as of December 31, 2011, to reduce our deferred tax assets, primarily associated with certain state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards, to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have federal net operating loss carryforwards which begin to expire in 2020 through 2025 of $28.2 million ($9.9 million, tax effected) at December 31, 2011 to reduce future federal taxable income. We have an asset for state net operating losses of $7.9 million (net of federal tax benefit), which begins to expire in 2012 through 2025, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 99%. We have assets for foreign net operating losses of $40.3 million, with various expiration dates, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 69%. We also have foreign tax credits of $56.6 million, which begin to expire in 2014 through 2019, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 65%. U.S. legislative changes in 2010 reduced the expected utilization of foreign tax credits which resulted in the requirement for a valuation allowance. If actual results differ unfavorably from certain of our estimates used, we may not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred income tax assets and foreign tax credit carryforwards, and additional valuation allowances may be required. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that our estimates reflected in the tax provisions and accruals will equal our actual results. These differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. 39 Table of Contents The evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two step process. The first step is a recognition process whereby the company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step is a measurement process whereby a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. As of December 31, 2010 and 2011, we had approximately $59.9 million and $31.4 million, respectively, of reserves related to uncertain tax positions. The reversal of these reserves will be recorded as a reduction of our income tax provision if sustained. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in favorable or unfavorable changes in our estimates. We have elected to recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of the provision (benefit) for income taxes. We recorded $4.7 million, $(1.6) million and $(8.5) million for gross interest and penalties for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively. We had $11.6 million and $2.8 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of December 31, 2010 and 2011, respectively. We have not provided deferred taxes on book basis differences related to certain foreign subsidiaries because such basis differences are not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future and we intend to reinvest indefinitely outside the U.S. These basis differences arose primarily through the undistributed book earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The basis differences could be reversed through a sale of the subsidiaries, the receipt of dividends from subsidiaries and certain other events or actions on our part, each of which would result in an increase in our provision for income taxes. It is not practicable to calculate the amount of such basis differences. Stock Based Compensation We record stock based compensation expense, utilizing the straight line method, for the cost of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units and shares of stock issued under the employee stock purchase plan. Stock based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011 was $18.7 million, including $3.5 million in discontinued operations, ($14.7 million after tax or $0.07 per basic and diluted share), $20.4 million, including $3.1 million in discontinued operations, ($15.7 million after tax or $0.08 per basic and diluted share) and $17.5 million, including $0.3 million in discontinued operations, ($8.8 million after tax or $0.05 per basic and diluted share), respectively. The fair values of option grants are estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatility and the expected term are the input factors to that model which require the most significant management judgment. Expected volatility is calculated utilizing daily historical volatility over a period that equates to the expected life of the option. The expected life (estimated period of time outstanding) of the stock options granted is estimated using the historical exercise behavior of employees. Self Insured Liabilities We are self insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers compensation claims, vehicle accidents, property and general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee healthcare 40 Table of Contents and short term disability programs. At December 31, 2010 and 2011, there were approximately $43.9 million and $39.4 million, respectively, of self insurance accruals reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. The measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historical cost experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. We account for these costs primarily through actuarial methods, which develop estimates of the undiscounted liability for claims incurred, including those claims incurred but not reported. These methods provide estimates of future ultimate claim costs based on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. We believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals. However, the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known. We believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are appropriate. Nevertheless, changes in healthcare costs, severity, and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2011 08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment. ASU 2011 08 allows but does not require entities to first assess qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative two step impairment test is required; otherwise, no further testing is required. ASU 2011 08 is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this ASU 2011 08 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

(2)Our internal revenue growth rate represents the weighted average year over year growth rate of our revenues after removing the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We calculate internal revenue growth in local currency for our international operations. Our consolidated storage revenues increased $84.3 million, or 5.3%, to $1,683.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 and $64.9 million, or 4.2%, to $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, in comparison to the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2011 is comprised of internal revenue growth of 3.1%. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations added approximately 1.4% to our storage revenue growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2011. Net acquisitions/divestitures contributed 0.8% of the increase in reported storage revenues in 2011. Our consolidated storage revenue growth in 2011 was driven by continued solid storage growth in the International Business segment and consistent volume and price increases in our North American Business segment. The growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to 2009 is comprised of internal revenue growth of 3.1%. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations added 1.1% to our storage revenue growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2010. Our consolidated storage revenue growth was moderated in 2010 by economic factors, resulting in reduced average net pricing gains in North America due to the low inflationary environment, episodic destructions in the physical data protection business and lower new sales and higher destruction rates in our North American Business segment, which were offset by new sales in international markets. 43  Table of Contents Consolidated service revenues, consisting of core service and complementary services, increased $38.1 million, or 2.9%, to $1,331.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $1,293.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Service revenue internal growth was 0.4% driven by complementary service revenue internal growth of 3.7% in 2011, partially offset by negative core service revenue internal growth of 0.8% in 2011. Complementary service revenues increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to $25.8 million of additional revenue generated from the sale of recycled paper due, in part, to increases in paper prices. Paper prices, however, declined significantly during the fourth quarter of 2011 and into 2012. Should paper prices remain at their current levels throughout 2012, we would expect revenues from the sale of recycled paper to be lower in 2012 than in 2011. Core service revenue internal growth in the year ended December 31, 2011 continued to be constrained by current economic trends and pressures on activity based service revenues related to the handling and transportation of items in storage. These decreases were partially offset by strong hybrid revenue growth and higher fuel surcharges. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations increased reported service revenues by 1.7% in 2011 over the same period in 2010. Net acquisitions/divestitures contributed 0.8% of the increase in reported service revenues in 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. Consolidated service revenues, consisting of core service and complementary services, increased $53.0 million, or 4.3%, to $1,293.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $1,240.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Service revenue internal growth was 3.0% as complementary service revenue internal growth of 15.6% in 2010 was offset by negative core service revenue internal growth of 0.9% in 2010. Complementary service revenues increased in 2010 primarily due to $36.8 million more revenue resulting from higher recycled paper pricing and gains in hybrid service revenues in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Core service revenue internal growth in the year ended December 31, 2010 was constrained by economic trends and pressures on activity based service revenues related to the handling and transportation of items in storage. Favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 increased reported service revenues 1.3%. For the reasons stated above, our consolidated revenues increased $122.4 million, or 4.2%, to $3,014.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $2,892.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recorded reductions to reported revenues of $6.0 million, $6.0 million and $4.8 million, respectively, related to a billing error involving a government contract. See Note 2.y. to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We calculate internal revenue growth in local currency for our international operations. Internal revenue growth was 1.9% for 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2011, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations increased our consolidated revenues by 1.5% primarily due to the strengthening of the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Euro against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. Net acquisitions/divestitures contributed 0.8% of the increase in total reported revenues in 2011 over the same period in 2010. Our consolidated revenues increased $118.0 million, or 4.3%, to $2,892.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $2,774.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Internal revenue growth was 3.1% for 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2010, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations increased our reported revenues by 1.2% primarily due to the strengthening of the British pound sterling and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, offset by the weakening of the Euro against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. 44 Table of Contents Internal Growth Eight Quarter Trend 2010 2011 First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Storage Revenue 4.3 % 3.7 % 2.3 % 2.3 % 3.0 % 2.8 % 3.3 % 3.3 % Service Revenue 4.5 % 2.4 % 3.9 % 1.1 % (0.1 )% 1.2 % 1.8 % (1.4 )% Total Revenue 4.4 % 3.1 % 3.0 % 1.8 % 1.6 % 2.1 % 2.6 % 1.2 % We expect our consolidated internal revenue growth for 2012 to be approximately (1)% to 2%. During the past eight quarters our storage revenue internal growth rate has ranged between 2.3% and 4.3%. Our storage revenue growth rate moderated in late 2009 and into 2010 due to the economic downturn, which resulted in reduced average net pricing gains in North America due to the low inflationary environment, episodic destructions in the physical data protection business and lower new sales and higher destruction rates in our North American Business segment. These impacts were offset by new sales in international markets. Our storage growth rate in 2011 was driven by continued solid storage growth in the International Business segment and sustained growth in our North American Business segment. The internal revenue growth rate for service revenue is inherently more volatile than the storage revenue internal growth rate due to the more discretionary nature of certain complementary services we offer, such as large special projects, and the volatility of prices for recycled paper. These revenues, which are often event driven and impacted to a greater extent by economic downturns as customers defer or cancel the purchase of certain services as a way to reduce their short term costs, may be difficult to replicate in future periods. As a commodity, recycled paper prices are subject to the volatility of that market. The revenue internal growth rate for service revenues reflects the following: (1) pressures on activity based service revenues related to the handling and transportation of items in storage and secure shredding; (2) the expected softness in our complementary service revenues, such as project revenues and fulfillment services; and (3) improvement in commodity prices for recycled paper during the first half of fiscal year 2011 and higher fuel surcharges.

For the year ended December 31, 2011, labor expense was unfavorably impacted by 1.8 percentage points due to currency rate changes. Excluding (1) the effect of currency rate fluctuations and (2) the impact associated with labor cost accruals related to the Brazilian litigation, in which a charge of $7.4 million was recorded in 2010 and a benefit of $3.5 million was recorded in 2011, labor expense increased by 2.6% in 2011 over 2010 primarily due to increased incentive compensation of $8.0 million as well as increased health insurance expenses of $5.0 million. Labor expense decreased to 20.1% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 21.2% for the year ended December 31, 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, labor expense was unfavorably impacted by 1.0 percentage points due to currency rate changes. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, labor expense decreased by 2.3% in 2010 primarily due to productivity gains in our North American Business segment, lower core service levels and lower incentive compensation expense of $12.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2010. Facilities Facilities costs were flat at 14.0% of consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. Facilities costs were unfavorably impacted by 1.7 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2011. The largest component of our facilities cost is rent expense, which, on a reported dollar basis, decreased to 12.5% of consolidated storage revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 13.0% in the same period in 2010. Other facilities costs increased by approximately $10.1 million, in constant currency terms, for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to increased building maintenance costs of $6.9 million and increased insurance costs of $5.4 million. Facilities costs decreased to 14.0% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 14.6% for the year ended December 31, 2009. Facilities costs were unfavorably impacted by 0.7 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2010. The largest component of our facilities cost is rent expense, which decreased on a reported dollar basis to 13.0% of consolidated storage revenues in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 13.4% in the same period in 2009. Other facilities costs decreased by approximately $2.0 million, in constant currency terms, for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to decreased building maintenance charges of $2.2 million. 46 Table of Contents Transportation Transportation expenses were unfavorably impacted by 2.0 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2011. Transportation expenses increased by $15.7 million in constant currency terms during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. The increase in transportation costs was primarily a result of increased third party transportation costs of $7.1 million, increased fuel costs of $6.3 million and increased vehicle repair, rental and insurance costs of $2.0 million. Transportation expenses were unfavorably impacted by 0.6 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2010. Transportation expenses decreased by $3.1 million in constant currency terms during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. A decrease of $3.3 million in vehicle lease expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009 was due to the capitalization of leased vehicles upon renewal. The lease cost did not change, but the categorization of charges did, resulting in the cost now being allocated to depreciation and interest. Product Cost of Sales and Other Product cost of sales and other, which includes cartons, media and other service, storage and supply costs, is highly correlated to complementary revenue streams. These costs were unfavorably impacted by 2.1 percentage points of currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2011. For 2011, product cost of sales and other increased by $3.8 million as compared to 2010 on an actual basis. Product cost of sales and other was unfavorably impacted by 3.5 percentage points of currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2010. For 2010, these costs decreased by $0.1 million as compared to 2009 on an actual basis.

General and administrative expenses were unfavorably impacted by 1.5 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2011. In constant currency terms, general and administrative expenses increased by $17.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. The increase was primarily attributable to $15.0 million of advisory fees and other costs in the first and second quarter of 2011 associated with our 2011 proxy contest and a $16.1 million increase in incentive compensation, partially offset by a reduction of $16.2 million in other professional fees within North America related to productivity investments incurred in 2010 and which did not repeat in 2011. General and administrative expenses decreased to 15.4% of consolidated revenues in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 15.6% in the year ended December 31, 2009. General and administrative expenses were unfavorably impacted by 0.8 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2010. In constant currency terms, general and administrative expenses increased by $9.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009. The increase was primarily attributable to increased compensation expense of $8.8 million. The increased compensation during the year ended December 31, 2010 is primarily a result of merit increases, increased medical and other benefits, as well as increased headcount primarily related to our continued investment in our hybrid records management services of $19.6 million, all of which were partially offset by a reduction in incentive compensation of $10.9 million. Sales, Marketing & Account Management Sales, marketing and account management expenses were unfavorably impacted by 1.8 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2011. In constant currency terms, the increase of $26.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 is primarily related to increased sales and marketing expenses, primarily related to a planned incremental investment of $20.0 million within North America to sustain the revenue annuity, primarily resulting in increased compensation of $23.9 million, due to increased sales commissions, payroll tax expenses and incentive compensation. Sales, marketing and account management expenses were unfavorably impacted by 1.5 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2010. In constant currency terms, the increase of $5.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 is primarily related to $2.9 million of increased marketing costs and $1.5 million of increased professional fees. 48 Table of Contents Information Technology Information technology expenses were unfavorably impacted by 1.5 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2011. In constant currency terms, information technology expenses increased $8.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 due primarily to an increase in incentive compensation and related payroll taxes of $6.1 million and health insurance and other benefit costs of $2.9 million. Information technology expenses were favorably impacted by 0.3 percentage point due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2010. In constant currency terms, information technology expenses increased $0.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily a result of increased overhead expenses of $5.4 million, partially offset by decreased compensation of $5.3 million, which offset was driven by lower incentive compensation. Bad Debt Expense Consolidated bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased $2.3 million to $9.5 million (0.3% of consolidated revenues) from $11.8 million (0.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts that is calculated based on our past loss experience, current and prior trends in our aged receivables, current economic conditions, and specific circumstances of individual receivable balances. We continue to monitor our customers payment activity and make adjustments based on their financial condition and in light of historical and expected trends. Consolidated bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $2.8 million to $11.8 million (0.4% of consolidated revenues) from $9.0 million (0.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009. Depreciation, Amortization, and (Gain) Loss on Disposal/Write down of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net Depreciation expense increased $11.9 million and $25.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, primarily due to additional depreciation expense related to capital expenditures and acquisitions, including storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems, hardware and software, and buildings primarily in our International Business segment. Amortization expense increased $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to an increase of customer relationship intangible assets acquired related to the Poland acquisition. Amortization expense increased $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to the increased amortization of intangible assets, such as customer relationship intangible assets acquired through business combinations. Consolidated gain on disposal/write down of property, plant and equipment, net of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 consisted primarily of (a) a gain of approximately $3.2 million related to the disposition of a facility in Canada and (b) a gain of approximately $3.0 million on the retirement of leased vehicles accounted for as capital lease assets in North America, offset by (c) a loss associated with discontinued use of certain third party software licenses of approximately $3.5 million (approximately $3.1 million associated with our International Business segment and approximately $0.4 million associated with our North American Business segment). Consolidated gain on disposal/write down of property, plant and equipment, net of $11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 consisted primarily of a gain of approximately $10.2 million as a result of the settlement with our insurers in connection with a portion of the property component of our claim related to the Chilean 49 Table of Contents earthquake in the third and fourth quarter of 2010, gains of approximately $3.2 million in North America primarily related to the disposition of certain owned equipment and a gain on disposal of a building in our International Business segment of approximately $1.3 million in the United Kingdom, offset by approximately $1.0 million of asset write downs associated with our Latin American operations and approximately $2.6 million of impairment losses primarily related to certain owned facilities in North America. Consolidated loss on disposal/write down of property, plant and equipment, net of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, consisted primarily of a gain on disposal of a building in our International Business segment of approximately $1.9 million in France, offset by losses on the write down of certain facilities of approximately $1.0 million in our North American Business segment, $0.7 million in our International Business segment and $0.3 million in Corporate (associated with discontinued products after implementation). Intangible Impairments During the quarter ended September 30, 2010, prior to our annual goodwill impairment review, we concluded that events occurred and circumstances changed in our former worldwide digital business reporting unit that required us to conduct an impairment review. The primary factors contributing to our conclusion that we had a triggering event and a requirement to reassess our former worldwide digital business reporting unit goodwill for impairment included: (1) a reduction in forecasted revenue and operating results due to continued pressure on key parts of the business as a result of the weak economy; (2) reduced revenue and profit outlook for our eDiscovery service due to smaller average matter size and lower pricing; (3) a decision to discontinue certain software development projects; and (4) the sale of the Domain Name Product Line. As a result of the review, we recorded a provisional goodwill impairment charge associated with our former worldwide digital business reporting unit in the amount of $255.0 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2010. We finalized the estimate in the fourth quarter of 2010, and we recorded an additional impairment of $28.8 million, for a total goodwill impairment charge of $283.8 million. Based on a relative fair value basis, we allocated $85.9 million of this charge to the retained technology escrow services business, which continues to be included in our continuing results of operations. We retained our technology escrow services business, which had previously been reported in the former worldwide digital business segment along with the Digital Business and the Domain Name Product Line. The technology escrow services business is now reported in the North American Business segment. In September 2011, as a result of certain changes we made in the manner in which our European operations are managed, we reorganized our reporting structure and reassigned goodwill among the revised reporting units. As a result of the management and reporting changes, we concluded that we have three reporting units for our European operations: (1) UKI; (2) Western Europe; and (3) Central Europe. Due to these changes, we will perform all future goodwill impairment analysis on the new reporting unit basis. As a result of the restructuring of our reporting units, we concluded that we had an interim triggering event, and, therefore, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test for UKI, Western Europe and Central Europe in the third quarter of 2011 as of August 31, 2011. As required by GAAP, prior to our goodwill impairment analysis, we performed an impairment assessment on the long lived assets within our UKI, Western Europe and Central Europe reporting units and noted no impairment, except for the Italian Business, which was included in our Western Europe reporting unit, and which is now included in discontinued operations below. Based on our analyses, we concluded that the goodwill of our UKI and Central Europe reporting units was not impaired. Our Western Europe reporting units fair value was less than its carrying value, and, as a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $46.5 million included as a component of intangible impairments from continuing operations in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011. 50 Table of Contents OPERATING INCOME and ADJUSTED OIBDA As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated operating income increased $23.7 million, or 4.3%, to $571.2 million (18.9% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $547.5 million (18.9% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010. As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated Adjusted OIBDA increased $8.2 million, or 0.9%, to $934.9 million (31.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $926.7 million (32.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010. As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated operating income increased $2.3 million, or 0.4%, to $547.5 million (18.9% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $545.2 million (19.7% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009. As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated Adjusted OIBDA increased $104.1 million, or 12.7%, to $926.7 million (32.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $822.6 million (29.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009. OTHER EXPENSES, NET Interest Expense, Net Consolidated interest expense, net increased $0.7 million to $205.3 million (6.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $204.6 million (7.1% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily due to the issuance of $400.0 million in aggregate principal of our 73/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2019 (the "73/4% Notes due 2019") in September 2011, which was partially offset by the early retirement of $431.3 million of our 73/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015 (the "73/4% Notes due 2015") during late 2010 and early 2011. We expect that our interest expense will increase in fiscal year 2012 compared to 2011 as a result of the issuance of our 73/4% Notes due 2019 as part of a planned increase in leverage to the midpoint of our 3x4x target leverage ratio range. Our weighted average interest rate was 6.9% at both December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 and 7.0% at December 31, 2009. Consolidated interest expense, net decreased $8.0 million to $204.6 million (7.1% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $212.5 million (7.7% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to a reduction in year over year short term borrowings on our revolving credit facility, as well as a reduction in our outstanding borrowings due to the early retirement of $200.0 million of our 73/4% Notes due 2015 during 2010.

Losses were primarily a result of British pound sterling denominated debt and forward foreign currency swap contracts and changes in the exchange rate of the Euro, Russian Ruble and certain Latin American currencies against the U.S. dollar compared to December 31, 2010, as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with and between our European and Latin American subsidiaries. Partially offsetting these losses were gains which resulted primarily from our Euro denominated bonds issued by IMI as well as changes in the exchange rate of the British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar compared to December 31, 2010, as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with and between our United Kingdom subsidiaries. Net foreign currency transaction losses of $5.7 million, based on period end exchange rates, were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2010. Losses resulted primarily from changes in the exchange rate of the British pounds sterling, the Euro and the Russian Ruble, offset by the Brazilian Real, against the U.S. dollar compared to December 31, 2009, as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with and between our European and Latin American subsidiaries, and gains associated with our British pound sterling forward contracts, British pound sterling denominated debt and Euro denominated debt issued by IMI. Net foreign currency transaction gains of $12.9 million, based on period end exchange rates, were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2009. Gains resulted primarily from changes in the exchange rate of the British pounds sterling, Euro, Brazilian Real and Chilean Peso against the U.S. dollar compared to December 31, 2008, as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with and between our European and Latin American subsidiaries, offset by losses as a result of British pounds sterling and Euro denominated debt and forward foreign currency swap contracts held by our U.S. parent company. During the year ended December 31, 2011 we recorded a gain of approximately $0.9 million in the first quarter of 2011 related to the early extinguishment of $231.3 million of our 73/4% Notes due 2015 that were redeemed. This gain consists of original issue premiums, net of deferred financing costs related to our 73/4% Notes due 2015 that were redeemed. Additionally, we recorded a charge of $1.8 million in the second quarter of 2011 related to the early retirement of our previous revolving credit and term loan facilities, representing a write off of deferred financing costs. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we redeemed $200.0 million of the $431.3 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 73/4% Notes due 2015 at a redemption price of $1,012.92 for each one thousand dollars of principal amount of the notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We recorded a charge to other expense (income), net of $1.8 million in the third quarter of 2010 related to the early extinguishment of our 73/4% Notes due 2015 that were redeemed. This charge consists of the call premium and deferred financing costs, net of original issue premiums related to our 73/4% Notes due 2015 that were redeemed. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we redeemed our 85/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 and wrote off $3.0 million in associated deferred financing costs. Other, net for the year ended December 31, 2011 was a gain of $5.3 million, which primarily consists of a $5.9 million gain associated with the fair valuing of the 20% equity interest that we previously held in our Polish joint venture in connection with our acquisition of the remaining 80% 52 Table of Contents interest in January 2011. Other, net in the year ended December 31, 2010 was a $1.3 million loss. Included in the loss for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $4.7 million of losses related to the impact of the change in IMEs fiscal year end. Since its inception, IME had operated with an October 31 fiscal year end. IMEs financial results had historically been consolidated with IMIs results with a two month lag. In order to better align our European processes with the enterprise, effective January 1, 2010, the IME fiscal year end was changed to December 31 to match the Companys fiscal year end. The $4.7 million charge represents the net impact of this change for the two years ended December 31, 2009. Partially offsetting this loss was $1.2 million of gains related to certain trading marketable securities held in a trust for the benefit of employees included in a deferred compensation plan we sponsor. Other, net in the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily consisted of $1.7 million of gains related to certain trading marketable securities held in a trust for the benefit of employees included in a deferred compensation plan we sponsor, in addition to $0.6 million of business interruption proceeds for an owned storage facility in France, which was taken by eminent domain in the first quarter of 2009. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011 were 32.9%, 50.1% and 30.2%, respectively. The primary reconciling items between the federal statutory rate of 35% and our overall effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2011 was the recognition of certain previously unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions of prior years, expirations of statute of limitation periods and settlements with tax authorities in various jurisdictions and differences in the rates of tax at which our foreign earnings are subject, including foreign exchange gains and losses in different jurisdictions with different tax rates. This benefit was partially offset by state income taxes (net of federal benefit). Additionally, to a lesser extent, a goodwill impairment charge included in income from continuing operations as a component of intangible impairments in our consolidated statements of operations, of which a majority was non deductible for tax purposes, is a reconciling item that impacts our effective tax rate. The primary reconciling item between the federal statutory rate of 35% and our overall effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 is a goodwill impairment charge included in income from continuing operations as a component of intangible impairments in our consolidated statements of operations, of which a majority was non deductible for tax purposes. The negative impact of U.S. legislative changes reducing the expected utilization of foreign tax credits was offset by the recognition of certain previously unrecognized tax benefits due to expirations of statute of limitation periods and settlements with tax authorities in various jurisdictions. Additionally, to a lesser extent, state income taxes (net of federal benefit) and differences in the rates of tax at which our foreign earnings are subject, including foreign exchange gains and losses in different jurisdictions with different tax rates, are also reconciling items and impact our effective tax rate. In 2009, we had significant unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on intercompany loans and on debt and derivative instruments in different jurisdictions with different tax rates. For 2009, foreign currency gains were recorded in lower tax jurisdictions associated with the marking to market of intercompany loan positions while foreign currency losses were recorded in higher tax jurisdictions associated with the marking to market of debt and derivative instruments, which reduced the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2009. Our effective tax rate is subject to variability in the future due to, among other items: (1) changes in the mix of income from foreign jurisdictions; (2) tax law changes; (3) volatility in foreign exchange gains and (losses); (4) the timing of the establishment and reversal of tax reserves; and (5) our ability to utilize foreign tax credits that we generate. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. Although we believe our tax estimates are 53 Table of Contents appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in changes in our estimates. Discrete items are recorded in the period they occur. INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased $79.7 million, or 47.8%, to $246.4 million (8.2% of consolidated revenues) from income from continuing operations of $166.7 million (5.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in income from continuing operations is primarily due to the year over year decrease of our provision for income taxes as described above and the goodwill impairment charge recorded in fiscal year 2010 associated with our technology escrow services business, which was previously a component of our former worldwide digital business segment, partially offset by the goodwill impairment charge recorded in fiscal year 2011 associated with our Western Europe reporting unit, as well as, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the year over year change in the (gain) loss on disposal/write down of property, plant and equipment, net. As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased $64.8 million, or 28.0%, to $166.7 million (5.8% of consolidated revenues) from income from continuing operations of $231.5 million (8.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in income from continuing operations is primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge associated with our technology escrow services business, which was previously a component of our former worldwide digital business segment, as well as, foreign currency exchange rate impacts and the impact of the change in IMEs fiscal year end included in other (income) expense, net and the impact of our tax rate for 2010 and the resulting increase in the provision for income taxes described above. INCOME (LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND GAIN (LOSS) ON SALE OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Loss from discontinued operations was $(12.1) million, $(219.4) million and $(47.4) million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively. We recorded a goodwill impairment charge associated with our former worldwide digital business reporting unit in the amount of $197.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 net of the amount allocated to the retained technology escrow services business, based on a relative fair value basis, which continues to be included in our continuing results of operations as previously discussed above. During 2011, we recorded an impairment charge of $4.9 million to write down the long lived assets of the New Zealand Business to its estimated net realizable value which is included in loss from discontinued operations. Additionally, we recorded a tax benefit of $7.9 million during 2011 associated with the outside tax basis of the New Zealand Business, which is also reflected in income (loss) from discontinued operations. Additionally, in conjunction with the goodwill impairment analysis performed associated with our Western Europe reporting unit, we performed an impairment test on the long lived assets of our Italian Business in the third quarter of 2011. The undiscounted cash flows from the Italian Business were lower than the carrying value of the long lived assets associated with the operations of the Italian Business and resulted in the requirement to fair value the long lived assets of this lower level component. As a result, we recorded write offs of other intangible assets, primarily customer relationship values of $8.0 million, and certain write downs to property, plant and equipment (primarily racking) long lived assets in Italy of $6.6 million in the third quarter of 2011, which are included in loss from discontinued operations. We allocated $2.5 million of the Western Europe goodwill impairment charge to the Italian Business which is included in loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2011. Pursuant to the Digital Sale Agreement, we received approximately $395.4 million in cash, consisting of the initial purchase price of $380.0 million and a preliminary working capital adjustment of approximately $15.4 million, which remains subject to a customary post closing adjustment based on 54 Table of Contents the amount of working capital at closing. The purchase price for the Digital Sale will be increased on a dollar for dollar basis if the working capital balance at the time of closing exceeds the target amount of working capital as set forth in the Digital Sale Agreement and decreased on a dollar for dollar basis if such closing working capital balance is less than the target amount. We and Autonomy are in disagreement regarding the working capital adjustment in the Digital Sale Agreement. As a result, as contemplated by the Digital Sale Agreement, the matter is being referred to an independent third party accounting firm for determination of the appropriate adjustment amount. Transaction costs relating to the Digital Sale amounted to approximately $7.4 million. Additionally, $11.1 million of inducements are payable to Autonomy and have been netted against the proceeds in calculating the gain on the Digital Sale. Also, a tax provision of $45.1 million associated with the gain recorded on the Digital Sale was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2011. A gain on sale of discontinued operations in the amount of $243.9 million ($198.7 million, net of tax) was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2011, as a result of the Digital Sale. We completed the sale of the New Zealand Business on October 3, 2011 for a purchase price of approximately $10.0 million. We recorded a gain on the sale of discontinued operations associated with the New Zealand Business of approximately $1.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2011. A gain on sale of discontinued operations of approximately $6.9 million ($2.8 million, net of tax) was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2010 associated with the divestiture of the Domain Name Product Line. NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS For the year ended December 31, 2011, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests resulted in a decrease in net income attributable to Iron Mountain Incorporated of $4.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2010, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests resulted in a decrease in net income attributable to Iron Mountain Incorporated of $4.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 2009, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests resulted in a reduction to net income attributable to Iron Mountain Incorporated of $1.4 million. These amounts represent our noncontrolling partners share of earnings/losses in our majority owned international subsidiaries that are consolidated in our operating results. Segment Analysis (in thousands) As a result of the disposition of our Digital Business and New Zealand Business and our decision to sell the Italian Business as discussed in Note 14 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we changed our reportable segments. The most significant of these changes is that the reportable segment previously referred to as the worldwide digital business is no longer reported separately in our management reporting as the operations associated with the Domain Name Product Line and the Digital Business are reported as discontinued operations. Also, the technology escrow services business, which we continue to own and operate and was previously reported in the former worldwide digital business segment, is now reported in the North American Business segment. Additionally, the International Business segment no longer includes the New Zealand Business and the Italian Business as these operations are reported as discontinued operations. Our reportable operating segments are North American Business, International Business and Corporate. See Note 9 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our North American Business segment offers information management services throughout the United States and Canada, including the storage of paper documents, as well as other media such as microfilm and microfiche, master audio and videotapes, film, X rays and blueprints, including healthcare information services, vital records services, service and courier operations, and the collection, handling and disposal of sensitive documents for corporate customers ("Hard Copy"); the storage and rotation of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster recovery plans, including service and courier operations ("Data Protection"); information destruction services ("Destruction"); the scanning, imaging and document 55 Table of Contents conversion services of active and inactive records ("Hybrid Services"); the storage, assembly, and detailed reporting of customer marketing literature and delivery to sales offices, trade shows and prospective customers sites based on current and prospective customer orders ("Fulfillment"), and technology escrow services that protect and manage source code. Our International Business segment offers information management services throughout Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific, including Hard Copy, Data Protection, Destruction and Hybrid Services. Corporate consists of costs related to executive and staff functions, including finance, human resources and information technology, which benefit the enterprise as a whole. These costs are primarily related to the general management of these functions on a corporate level and the design and development of programs, policies and procedures that are then implemented in the individual segments, with each segment bearing its own cost of implementation. Corporate also includes stock based employee compensation expense associated with all employee stock based awards.

During the year ended December 31, 2011, revenue in our North American Business segment increased 1.6% over the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to internal growth of 1.1%. Internal growth was due to storage internal growth of 2.2% related to increased new sales and lower volume outflows, partially offset by total service internal growth of negative 0.3%. Our core service revenues were constrained by lower service and activity levels partially offset by higher fuel surcharges, yielding negative internal growth of 1.4% for the year ended December 31, 2011, while our complementary service revenue yielded 2.5% internal growth as a result of higher pricing of recycled paper, as well as improved special project and product sales. Additionally, favorable foreign currency rate changes related to the Canadian dollar resulted in increased 2011 revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, of 0.4% for the year ended December 31, 2011. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue decreased for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 due mainly to increases in sales and marketing expenses of $27.5 million, inclusive of a planned incremental investment of $20.0 million to sustain the revenue annuity, and higher incentive compensation accruals of $20.6 million, partially offset by a constant currency increase in revenue of 56 Table of Contents $26.0 million and a reduction of $16.2 million in professional fees related to productivity investments incurred in 2010 and which did not repeat in 2011. During the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue in our North American Business segment increased 3.2% over the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to internal growth of 2.3%. Total revenue internal growth was comprised of storage internal growth of 2.3% related to increased Hard Copy and Data Protection revenues and service internal growth of 2.4%. Economic factors led to a moderation in our storage growth rate as a result of reduced average net pricing gains due to the current low inflationary environment, episodic destructions in the data protection business and lower new sales and higher destruction rates in our physical business over the past year. Core service revenue growth was also constrained by economic trends and pressures on activity based services revenues related to the handling and transportation of items in storage. Our core services business yielded negative internal growth of 2.2%, which was more than offset by complementary services revenues internal growth of 16.3%, due primarily to higher recycled paper prices and gains in hybrid service revenues. Additionally, favorable foreign currency rate changes related to Canada resulted in increased 2010 revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, of 0.9%. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue increased in 2010 due mainly to productivity gains and disciplined cost management, partially offset by a $5.5 million increase in general and administrative compensation and a $1.4 million increase in bad debt expense.

Revenue in our International Business segment increased 12.4% during the year ended December 31, 2011 over 2010 due to internal growth of 4.3% and foreign currency fluctuations in 2011, primarily in Europe, which resulted in increased 2011 revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, of approximately 5.1% as compared to 2010. Total internal revenue growth for the segment for the year ended December 31, 2011 was supported by solid 6.2% storage internal growth and total service internal growth of 2.3%. Acquisitions contributed 3.0% of the increase in total reported international revenues in the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to our acquisitions in Poland in the first 57 Table of Contents quarter of 2011 and Greece in the second quarter of 2010. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue increased in the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 primarily due to increased operating income from productivity gains, pricing actions and disciplined cost management, offset by $5.9 million of additional productivity investments. Revenue in our International Business segment increased 7.6% during the year ended December 31, 2010 over 2009 due to internal revenue growth of 5.3% supported by storage internal growth of 6.0% and core services internal growth of 2.4%. The impact of acquisitions increased reported revenue by 0.3% in 2010. Foreign currency fluctuations in 2010, primarily in Europe, resulted in increased 2010 revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, of approximately 2.0% as compared to 2009. Adjusted OIBDA increased in 2010 by $10.5 million compared to the same period in 2009 due to increased operating income from productivity gains, pricing actions and disciplined cost management, partially offset by increased compensation expense of $9.5 million primarily related to investments in our hybrid records management services, as well as one time cost accruals recorded in 2010 of approximately $7.4 million. Corporate Dollar Change Percentage Change Year Ended December 31, from 2009 to 2010 from 2010 to 2011 from 2009 to 2010 from 2010 to 2011 2009 2010 2011 Segment Adjusted OIBDA(1) $ (164,259 ) $ (173,798 ) $ (191,273 ) $ (9,539 ) $ (17,475 ) (5.8 )% (10.1 )% Segment Adjusted OIBDA(1) as a Percentage of Consolidated Revenue (5.9 )% (6.0 )% (6.3 )% (1)See Note 9 to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for definition of Adjusted OIBDA and for the basis on which allocations are made and a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to income (loss) from continuing operations before provision (benefit) for income taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2011, expenses in the Corporate segment as a percentage of consolidated revenues increased 10.1% over 2010. This increase was primarily due to $15.0 million of advisory fees and other costs associated with our 2011 proxy contest. During the year ended December 31, 2010, expenses in the Corporate segment increased 5.8% over 2009. This increase was primarily driven by increased sales, marketing and account management expenses of $6.0 million, higher professional fees of $2.2 million related to productivity and cost saving initiatives, an insurance deductible of $2.8 million associated with earthquakes, increased stock based compensation of $2.1 million and increased marketing expenses, partially offset by a reduction in incentive compensation. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following is a summary of our cash balances and cash flows (in thousands) as of and for the years ended December 31, 2009 2010 2011 Cash flows from operating activities continuing operations $ 586,570 $ 603,229 $ 663,514 Cash flows from investing activities continuing operations (298,699 ) (298,458 ) (302,213 ) Cash flows from financing activities continuing operations (128,286 ) (379,711 ) (762,670 ) Cash and cash equivalents at the end of year 446,656 258,693 179,845 58 Table of Contents Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $663.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $603.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The 10.0% increase resulted primarily from an increase in net income, excluding non cash charges of $31.3 million, a decrease in cash used for working capital of $23.9 million and a decrease in realized foreign exchange losses of $5.1 million over the same period last year. Uses of working capital are primarily related to lower taxes paid from continuing operations, excluding the $52.4 million of taxes paid as a result of the sale of our Digital Business which is classified in discontinued operations, lower amounts paid for cash interest and cash incentive compensation in fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010, partially offset by a reduction in cash collections from customers associated with accounts receivable. We expect our cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations to decrease in fiscal year 2012 as a result of a reduction in Adjusted OIBDA related to lower recycled paper revenues, combined with higher interest costs and higher incentive compensation payouts compared to fiscal year 2011. Our business requires significant capital expenditures to support our expected revenue growth and ongoing operations as well as new products and services and increased profitability. These expenditures are included in the cash flows from investing activities from continuing operations. The nature of our capital expenditures has evolved over time along with the nature of our business. We make capital expenditures to support a number of different objectives. The majority of our capital goes to support business line growth and our ongoing operations, but we also expend capital to support the development and improvement of products and services and projects designed to increase our profitability. These expenditures are generally small and more discretionary in nature. Cash paid for our capital expenditures, cash paid for acquisitions (net of cash acquired) and additions to customer acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2011 amounted to $209.2 million, $75.2 million and $21.7 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2011, capital expenditures, net, cash paid for acquisitions (net of cash acquired) and additions to customer acquisition costs were funded with cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations and cash equivalents on hand. Excluding potential future acquisitions, we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately $215.0 million in the year ending December 31, 2012. Included in our estimated capital expenditures for 2012 is approximately $25.0 million of real estate purchases. Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $762.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. During 2011, we received (i) $394.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of our 73/4% Notes due 2019; (ii) net borrowings under our revolving credit and term loan facilities and other debt of $153.8 million; and (iii) $85.7 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan. We used the proceeds from these financing transactions and cash on hand: (i) for the early retirement of $231.3 million of our 73/4% Notes due 2015; (ii) to repurchase $985.0 million of our common stock; (iii) to pay dividends in the amount of $172.6 million on our common stock; and (iv) to fund debt financing costs of $9.0 million. Our board of directors has authorized up to $1.2 billion in repurchases of our common stock. All purchases are subject to stock price, market conditions, corporate and legal requirements and other factors. As of December 31, 2011, we had a remaining amount available for repurchase under our share repurchase program of $100.7 million, which represents approximately 2% in the aggregate of our outstanding common stock based on the closing price on such date. 59 Table of Contents The following table is a summary of our repurchase activity under all of our share repurchase programs during 2011: 2011 Shares Amount(1) (In thousands) Authorizations remaining as of January 1, $ 238,532 Additional Authorizations 850,000 Repurchases paid 31,743,886 (984,469 ) Repurchases unsettled 109,532 (3,362 ) Authorization remaining as of December 31, $ 100,701 (2) (1)Amount excludes commissions paid associated with share repurchases.

In February 2010, our board of directors adopted a dividend policy under which we have paid and in the future intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors. In fiscal years 2010 and 2011, our board of directors declared the following dividends: Declaration Date Dividend Per Share Record Date Total Amount Payment Date (in thousands) March 25, 2010 $ 0.0625 March 25, 2010 $ 12,720 April 15, 2010 June 4, 2010 0.0625 June 25, 2010 12,641 July 15, 2010 September 15, 2010 0.0625 September 28, 2010 12,532 October 15, 2010 December 10, 2010 0.1875 December 27, 2010 37,514 January 14, 2011 March 11, 2011 0.1875 March 25, 2011 37,601 April 15, 2011 June 10, 2011 0.2500 June 24, 2011 50,694 July 15, 2011 September 8, 2011 0.2500 September 23, 2011 46,877 October 14, 2011 December 1, 2011 0.2500 December 23, 2011 43,180 January 13, 2012 We are committed to stockholder payouts through a combination of share buybacks, ongoing quarterly dividends and potential one time dividends of approximately $2.2 billion through 2013, with approximately $1.2 billion of capital returned to stockholders by May 2012. Through February 10, 2012, we have returned approximately $1.15 billion to stockholders against these commitments. We expect to fund future payouts with cash flows from operations and borrowings under existing and potentially additional debt instruments. With regard to our levels of indebtedness, we plan to operate around the mid point of our target leverage ratio range of 3x 4x EBITDA (as defined in our revolving credit facility). Financial instruments that potentially subject us to market risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds and time deposits), restricted cash (primarily U.S. Treasuries) and accounts receivable. The only significant concentrations of liquid investments as of December 31, 2011 relate to cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash held on deposit with five global banks and one "Triple A" rated money market fund which we consider to be large, highly rated investment grade institutions. As per our risk management investment policy, we limit exposure to concentration of credit risk by limiting the amount invested in any one mutual fund or financial institution to a maximum of $50.0 million. As of December 31, 2011, our cash and cash equivalents and 60 Table of Contents restricted cash balance was $215.0 million, including a money market fund and time deposits amounting to $181.8 million. A substantial portion of the money market fund is invested in U.S. Treasuries. We are highly leveraged and expect to continue to be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future. Our consolidated debt as of December 31, 2011 was comprised of the following (in thousands): New Revolving Credit Facility(1) $ 96,000 New Term Loan Facility(1) 487,500 71/4% GBP Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 (the "71/4% Notes")(2) 233,115 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016 (the "65/8% Notes")(2) 318,025 71/2% CAD Senior Subordinated Notes due 2017 (the "Subsidiary Notes")(3) 171,273 83/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 (the "83/4% Notes")(2) 200,000 8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 (the "8% Notes")(2) 49,806 63/4% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 (the "63/4% Notes")(2) 328,750 73/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2019 (the "73/4% Notes due 2019")(2) 400,000 8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 (the "8% Notes due 2020")(2) 300,000 83/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2021 (the "83/8% Notes")(2) 548,346 Real Estate Mortgages, Capital Leases and Other (4) 220,773 Total Long term Debt 3,353,588 Less Current Portion (73,320 ) Long term Debt, Net of Current Portion $ 3,280,268 (1)The capital stock or other equity interests of most of our U.S. subsidiaries, and up to 66% of the capital stock or other equity interests of our first tier foreign subsidiaries, are pledged to secure these debt instruments, together with all intercompany obligations of foreign subsidiaries owed to us or to one of our U.S. subsidiary guarantors. (2)Collectively, the "Parent Notes". IMI is the direct obligor on the Parent Notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior subordinated basis, by substantially all of its direct and indirect wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries (the "Guarantors"). These guarantees are joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. Iron Mountain Canada Corporation ("Canada Company") and the remainder of our subsidiaries do not guarantee the Parent Notes. (3)Canada Company is the direct obligor on the Subsidiary Notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior subordinated basis, by IMI and the Guarantors. These guarantees are joint and several obligations of IMI and the Guarantors. (4)Includes (a) real estate mortgages of $5.2 million, (b) capital lease obligations of $207.3 million, and (c) other various notes and other obligations, which were assumed by us as a result of certain acquisitions, of $8.2 million. On June 27, 2011, we entered into a new credit agreement to replace the IMI revolving credit facility and the IMI term loan facility, each entered into on April 16, 2007. The new credit agreement consists of (i) revolving credit facilities under which we can borrow, subject to certain limitations as defined in the new credit agreement, up to an aggregate amount of $725.0 million (including Canadian dollars, British pounds sterling and Euros, among other currencies) (the "New Revolving Credit Facility") and (ii) a $500.0 million term loan facility (the "New Term Loan Facility," and collectively with the New Revolving Credit Facility, the "New Credit Agreement"). We have the right to increase the aggregate amount available to be borrowed under the New Credit Agreement up to a maximum of $1.8 billion. The New Revolving Credit Facility is supported by a group of 19 banks. IMI, Iron Mountain Information Management, Inc. ("IMIM"), Canada Company, IME, Iron Mountain Australia Pty Ltd., Iron Mountain Switzerland Gmbh and any other subsidiary of IMIM designated by IMIM 61 Table of Contents (the "Other Subsidiaries") may, with the consent of the administrative agent, as defined in the New Credit Agreement, borrow under certain of the following tranches of the New Revolving Credit Facility: (a) tranche one in the amount of $400.0 million is available to IMI and IMIM in U.S. dollars, British pounds sterling and Euros, (b) tranche two in the amount of $150.0 million is available to IMI or IMIM in either U.S. dollars or Canadian dollars and available to Canada Company in Canadian dollars and (c) tranche three in the amount of $175.0 million is available to IMI or IMIM and the Other Subsidiaries in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, British pounds sterling, Euros and Australian dollars, among others. The New Revolving Credit Facility terminates on June 27, 2016, at which point all revolving credit loans under such facility become due. With respect to the New Term Loan Facility, loan payments are required through maturity on June 27, 2016 in equal quarterly installments of the aggregate annual amounts based upon the following percentage of the original principal amount in the table below (except that each of the first three quarterly installments in the fifth year shall be 10% of the original principal amount and the final quarterly installment in the fifth year shall be 35% of the original principal): Year Ended Percentage June 30, 2012 5% June 30, 2013 5% June 30, 2014 10% June 30, 2015 15% June 27, 2016 65% The New Term Loan Facility may be prepaid without penalty or premium, in whole or in part, at any time. IMI and IMIM guarantee the obligations of each of the subsidiary borrowers. The capital stock or other equity interests of most of the U.S. subsidiaries, and up to 66% of the capital stock or other equity interests of our first tier foreign subsidiaries, are pledged to secure the New Credit Agreement, together with all intercompany obligations of foreign subsidiaries owed to us or to one of our U.S. subsidiary guarantors. The interest rate on borrowings under the New Credit Agreement varies depending on our choice of interest rate and currency options, plus an applicable margin, which varies based on certain financial ratios. Additionally, the New Credit Agreement requires the payment of a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility, which fee ranges from between 0.3% to 0.5% based on certain financial ratios, as well as fees associated with any outstanding letters of credit. Proceeds from the New Credit Agreement are for general corporate purposes and were used to repay the previous revolving credit and term loan facilities. We recorded a charge of $1.8 million to other expense (income), net in the second quarter of 2011 related to the early retirement of the previous revolving credit and term loan facilities, representing a write off of deferred financings costs. As of December 31, 2011, we had $96.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the New Revolving Credit Facility, all of which was denominated in U.S. dollars; we also had various outstanding letters of credit totaling $5.8 million. The remaining availability on December 31, 2011, based on IMIs leverage ratio, which is calculated based on the last 12 months earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), and other adjustments as defined in the New Credit Agreement and current external debt, under the New Revolving Credit Facility was $623.2 million. The interest rate in effect under the New Revolving Credit Facility and New Term Loan Facility was 4.0% and 2.3%, respectively, as of December 31, 2011. The New Credit Agreement, our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to complete acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger. Therefore, a change in our debt rating would not trigger a default under the New Credit Agreement, our indentures or other agreements governing our indebtedness. The New Credit Agreement, as well as our indentures, use EBITDA based calculations as primary measures of financial performance, including leverage and fixed 62 Table of Contents charge coverage ratios. IMIs revolving credit and term leverage ratio was 2.9 and 3.4 as of December 31, 2010 and 2011, respectively, compared to a maximum allowable ratio of 5.5. Similarly, our bond leverage ratio, per the indentures, was 3.4 and 3.9 as of December 31, 2010 and 2011, respectively, compared to a maximum allowable ratio of 6.5. IMIs revolving credit and term loan fixed charge coverage ratio was 1.5 as of December 31, 2011, compared to a minimum allowable ratio of 1.2. Noncompliance with these leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. Our ability to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, working capital levels and capital structure, which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors which may be beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future financings will be available on acceptable terms or in amounts sufficient to enable us to service or refinance our indebtedness or to make necessary capital expenditures. In January 2011, we redeemed the remaining $231.3 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 73/4% Notes due 2015 at a redemption price of one thousand dollars for each one thousand dollars of principal amount of notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We recorded a gain to other expense (income), net of approximately $0.9 million in the first quarter of 2011 related to the early extinguishment of our 73/4% Notes due 2015 that were redeemed. This gain consists of original issue premiums, net of deferred financing costs related to our 73/4% Notes due 2015 that were redeemed. On June 2, 2011, we completed the sale of the Digital Business to Autonomy. Pursuant to the Digital Sale Agreement, we received approximately $395.4 million in cash, consisting of the initial purchase price of $380.0 million and a preliminary working capital adjustment of approximately $15.4 million, which remains subject to a customary post closing adjustment based on the amount of working capital at closing. The purchase price for the Digital Sale will be increased on a dollar for dollar basis if the working capital balance at the time of closing exceeds the target amount of working capital as set forth in the Digital Sale Agreement and decreased on a dollar for dollar basis if such closing working capital balance is less than the target amount. We and Autonomy are in disagreement regarding the working capital adjustment in the Digital Sale Agreement. As a result, as contemplated by the Digital Sale Agreement, the matter is being referred to an independent third party accounting firm for determination of the appropriate adjustment. Transaction costs related to the Digital Sale amounted to approximately $7.4 million. Additionally, $11.1 million of inducements are payable to Autonomy and have been netted against the proceeds in calculating the gain on the Digital Sale. We used the net proceeds received from the Digital Sale to pay down amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and used $52.4 million of the net proceeds to fund cash taxes due as a result of the Digital Sale. In September 2011, we completed an underwritten public offering of $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 73/4% Notes due 2019, which were issued at 100% of par. Our net proceeds of $394.0 million after paying the underwriters discounts and commissions, were used for general corporate purposes, including funding a portion of the stockholder payout commitments we have made. 63 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 13 Years 35 Years More than 5 Years Capital Lease Obligations $ 207,300 $ 41,028 $ 64,029 $ 26,578 $ 75,665 Long Term Debt Obligations (excluding Capital Lease Obligations) 3,151,895 32,292 336,343 779,770 2,003,490 Interest Payments(1) 1,547,822 223,402 428,151 369,409 526,860 Operating Lease Obligations(2)(3) 2,698,542 217,634 403,095 365,486 1,712,327 Purchase and Asset Retirement Obligations(4) 68,580 36,352 20,346 1,325 10,557 Total(3)(5) $ 7,674,139 $ 550,708 $ 1,251,964 $ 1,542,568 $ 4,328,899 (1)Amounts include variable rate interest payments, which are calculated utilizing the applicable interest rates as of December 31, 2011; see Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts also include interest on capital leases. (2)Amounts are offset by sublease income of $10.6 million in total (including $2.3 million, $3.6 million, $2.8 million and $1.9 million, in less than 1 year, 13 years, 35 years and more than 5 years, respectively). (3)Includes aggregate amounts related to our Italian Business of $2.6 million, $3.7 million, $3.5 million, $8.2 million ($18.0 million in total) in less than 1 year, 13 years, 35 years and more than 5 years, respectively. (4)In connection with some of our acquisitions, we have potential earn out obligations that may be payable in the event businesses we acquired meet certain financial objectives. These payments are based on the future results of these operations, and our estimate of the maximum contingent earn out payments we may be required to make under all such agreements as of December 31, 2011 is approximately $4.5 million. (5)The table above excludes $31.4 million in uncertain tax positions as we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. We expect to meet our cash flow requirements for the next twelve months from cash generated from operations, existing cash, cash equivalents, borrowings under the New Credit Agreement and other financings, which may include secured credit facilities, securitizations and mortgage or capital lease financings. We expect to meet our long term cash flow requirements using the same means described above, as well as the potential issuance of debt or equity securities as we deem appropriate. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S K Item 303(a)(4)(ii). Net Operating Losses and Foreign Tax Credit Carryforwards We have federal net operating loss carryforwards which begin to expire in 2020 through 2025 of $28.2 million ($9.9 million, tax effected) at December 31, 2011 to reduce future federal taxable income. We have an asset for state net operating losses of $7.9 million (net of federal tax benefit), which begins 64 Table of Contents to expire in 2012 through 2025, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 99%. We have assets for foreign net operating losses of $40.3 million, with various expiration dates, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 69%. We also have foreign tax credits of $56.6 million, which begin to expire in 2014 through 2019, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 65%. U.S. legislative changes in 2010 reduced the expected utilization of foreign tax credits which resulted in the requirement for a valuation allowance. Inflation Certain of our expenses, such as wages and benefits, insurance, occupancy costs and equipment repair and replacement, are subject to normal inflationary pressures. Although to date we have been able to offset inflationary cost increases through increased operating efficiencies and the negotiation of favorable long term real estate leases, we can give no assurance that we will be able to offset any future inflationary cost increases through similar efficiencies, leases or increased storage or service charges.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Market Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to market risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds and time deposits), restricted cash (primarily U.S. Treasuries) and accounts receivable. The only significant concentrations of liquid investments as of December 31, 2011 relate to cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash held on deposit with five global banks and one "Triple A" rated money market fund which we consider to be large, highly rated investment grade institutions. As per our risk management investment policy, we limit exposure to concentration of credit risk by limiting the amount invested in any one mutual fund or financial institution to a maximum of $50.0 million. As of December 31, 2011, our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash balance was $215.0 million, including a money market fund and time deposits amounting to $181.8 million. A substantial portion of the money market fund is invested in U.S. Treasuries. Interest Rate Risk Given the recurring nature of our revenues and the long term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the preference to use long term, fixed interest rate debt to finance our business, thereby helping to preserve our long term returns on invested capital. We target approximately 75% of our debt portfolio to be fixed with respect to interest rates. Occasionally, we will use interest rate swaps as a tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. See Notes 3 and 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2011, we had $586.7 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable interest rate of approximately 2.6%, and $2,766.9 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2011, approximately 82.5% of our total debt outstanding was fixed. If the weighted average variable interest rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%, our net income for the year ended December 31, 2011 would have been reduced by approximately $3.4 million. See Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our long term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of December 31, 2011. Currency Risk Our investments in IME, Canada Company, Iron Mountain Mexico, SA de RL de CV, Iron Mountain South America, Ltd., Iron Mountain Australia Pty Ltd. and our other international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties related to fluctuations in currency valuation. Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. However, our international revenues and expenses are generated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate, primarily the Euro, Canadian dollar 65 Table of Contents and British pound sterling. Declines in the value of the local currencies in which we are paid relative to the U.S. dollar will cause revenues in U.S. dollar terms to decrease and dollar denominated liabilities to increase in local currency. The impact of currency fluctuations on our earnings is mitigated significantly by the fact that most operating and other expenses are also incurred and paid in the local currency. We also have several intercompany obligations between our foreign subsidiaries and IMI and our U.S. based subsidiaries. In addition, Iron Mountain Switzerland GmbH, our foreign subsidiaries and IME also have intercompany obligations between them. These intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary. We have adopted and implemented a number of strategies to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in currency valuations. One strategy is to finance certain of our international subsidiaries with debt that is denominated in local currencies, thereby providing a natural hedge. In determining the amount of any such financing, we take into account local tax strategies, among other factors. Another strategy we utilize is for IMI or IMIM to borrow in foreign currencies to hedge our intercompany financing activities. In addition, on occasion, we enter into currency swaps to temporarily or permanently hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition, to lock in certain transaction economics. We have implemented these strategies for our foreign investments in the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Canada. Specifically, through our 150.0 million British pounds sterling denominated 71/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 and our 255.0 million 63/4% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018, we effectively hedge most of our outstanding intercompany loans denominated in British pounds sterling and Euros. Canada Company has financed its capital needs through direct borrowings in Canadian dollars under the Credit Agreement and its 175.0 million CAD denominated 71/2% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2017. This creates a tax efficient natural currency hedge. In the third quarter of 2007, we designated a portion of our 63/4% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 issued by IMI as a hedge of net investment of certain of our Euro denominated subsidiaries. As a result, we recorded $8.6 million ($5.4 million, net of tax) of foreign exchange gains related to the "marking to market" of such debt to currency translation adjustments which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive items, net included in equity for the year ended December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, net gains of $13.4 million are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive items, net associated with this net investment hedge. We have also entered into a number of separate forward contracts to hedge our exposures to British pounds sterling and Australian dollars. As of December 31, 2011, we had an outstanding forward contract to purchase $195.6 million U.S. dollars and sell 125.0 million British pounds sterling to hedge our intercompany exposures with IME. As of December 31, 2011, we had an outstanding forward contract to purchase $75.1 million U.S. dollars and sell 73.0 million Australian dollars to hedge our intercompany exposures with our Australian subsidiary. At the maturity of the forward contracts, we may enter into new forward contracts to hedge movements in the underlying currencies. At the time of settlement, we either pay or receive the net settlement amount from the forward contract and recognize this amount in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of operations as a realized foreign exchange gain or loss. We have not designated these forward contracts as hedges. At the end of each month, we mark the outstanding forward contracts to market and record an unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss for the mark to market valuation. During the year ended December 31, 2011, there was $1.1 million in net cash disbursements included in cash from operating activities from continuing operations related to settlements associated with these foreign currency forward contracts. We recorded net gains in connection with these forward contracts of $1.2 million (including an unrealized foreign exchange gain of $2.0 million related to certain British pound sterling forward contracts and an unrealized foreign exchange gain of $0.8 million related to the Australian dollar forward contract offset by an unrealized foreign exchange loss of $0.4 million related to a British pound sterling forward contract) in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of 66 Table of Contents operations as of December 31, 2011, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, except as noted above, our currency exposures to intercompany balances are not hedged. The impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and or reduce expenses. Due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange fluctuations on our business. The effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Items, net" component of equity. A 10% depreciation in year end 2011 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction in our equity of approximately $79.8 million.  
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with "Item 6. Selected Financial Data" and the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto and the other financial and operating information included elsewhere in this filing. This discussion contains "forward looking statements" as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and in other federal securities laws. See "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements" on page ii of this filing and "Item 1A. Risk Factors" beginning on page 15 of this filing. Overview In August 2010, we divested the domain name management product line (the "Domain Name Product Line") of our digital business. On June 2, 2011, we completed the sale (the "Digital Sale") of our online backup and recovery, digital archiving and eDiscovery solutions businesses (the "Digital Business") to Autonomy, pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement dated as of May 15, 2011 among Iron Mountain Incorporated ("IMI"), certain subsidiaries of IMI and Autonomy (the "Digital Sale Agreement"). In the Digital Sale, Autonomy purchased (i) the shares of certain of IMIs subsidiaries through which IMI conducted the Digital Business and (ii) certain assets of IMI and its subsidiaries relating to our Digital Business. The financial position, operating results and cash flows of the Domain Name Product Line and the Digital Business, for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, including the gains on the sales, have been reported as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes. IMI retained its technology escrow services business which had previously been reported in the former worldwide digital business segment along with the Digital Business and the Domain Name Product Line. The technology escrow services business is now reported in the North American Business segment. Additionally, on October 3, 2011, we sold our records management business in New Zealand (the "New Zealand Business"). The financial position, operating results and cash flows of the New Zealand Business, including the gain on the sale, for all periods presented, have been reported as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes. Also, in December 2011, we committed to a plan to sell the Italian Business. The financial position, operating results and cash flows of the Italian Business, for all periods presented, have been reported as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes. See Note 14 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 29  Table of Contents Consolidated statements of operations amounts for 2009 and 2010 were restated in connection with the government contract billing error more fully discussed in Notes 2.y. and 10.h. to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result, 2009 and 2010 consolidated statements of operations amounts related to: (a) storage, (b) service, (c) total revenues, (d) operating income, (e) income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes, (f) provision for income taxes, (g) income from continuing operations, (h) net income (loss) and (g) net income (loss) attributable to Iron Mountain Incorporated have been changed throughout managements discussion and analysis to conform to the restated figures. Our revenues consist of storage revenues as well as service revenues. Storage revenues, which are considered a key performance indicator for the information management services industry, consist primarily of recurring periodic charges related to the storage of materials or data (generally on a per unit basis) that are typically retained by customers for many years and have accounted for over 55% of total consolidated revenues in each of the last three years. Our annual revenues from these fixed periodic storage fees have grown for 23 consecutive years. Service revenues are comprised of charges for related core service activities and a wide array of complementary products and services. Included in core service revenues are: (1) the handling of records, including the addition of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records and the destruction of records; (2) courier operations, consisting primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request; (3) secure shredding of sensitive documents; and (4) other recurring services, including hybrid services and recurring project revenues. Our complementary services revenues include special project work, customer termination and permanent withdrawal fees, data restoration projects, fulfillment services, consulting services, technology services and product sales (including specially designed storage containers and related supplies). A by product of our secure shredding and destruction services is the sale of recycled paper (included in complementary services revenues), the price of which can fluctuate from period to period, adding to the volatility and reducing the predictability of that revenue stream. Our consolidated revenues are also subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenue derived from outside the U.S. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, we derived approximately 31%, 32% and 34%, respectively, of our total revenues from outside the U.S. We recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Storage and service revenues are recognized in the month the respective storage or service is provided, and customers are generally billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed upon terms. Amounts related to future storage or prepaid service contracts for customers where storage fees or services are billed in advance are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the applicable storage or service period or when the service is performed. Revenue from the sales of products, which is included as a component of service revenues, is recognized when products are shipped to the customer and title has passed to the customer. Revenues from the sales of products have historically not been significant. Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) consists primarily of wages and benefits for field personnel, facility occupancy costs (including rent and utilities), transportation expenses (including vehicle leases and fuel), other product cost of sales and other equipment costs and supplies. Of these, wages and benefits and facility occupancy costs are the most significant. Trends in total wages and benefits in dollars and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance and workers compensation. Trends in facility occupancy costs are impacted by the total number of facilities we occupy, the mix of properties we own versus properties we occupy under operating leases, fluctuations in per square foot occupancy costs, and the levels of utilization of these properties. 30 Table of Contents The expansion of our European and secure shredding businesses has impacted the major cost of sales components. Our European operations are more labor intensive than our North American businesses and, therefore, add incremental labor costs at a higher percentage of segment revenue than our North American business. Our secure shredding operations incur lower facility costs and higher transportation costs as a percentage of revenues compared to our core physical businesses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for management, administrative, information technology, sales, account management and marketing personnel, as well as expenses related to communications and data processing, travel, professional fees, bad debts, training, office equipment and supplies. Trends in total wage and benefit dollars as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance. The overhead structure of our expanding European and Asian operations, as compared to our North American operations, is more labor intensive and has not achieved the same level of overhead leverage, which may result in an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of consolidated revenue, as our European and Asian operations become a more meaningful percentage of our consolidated results. Our depreciation and amortization charges result primarily from the capital intensive nature of our business. The principal components of depreciation relate to storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings. Amortization relates primarily to customer relationship acquisition costs and is impacted by the nature and timing of acquisitions. In September 2011, as a result of certain changes we made in the manner in which our European operations are managed, we reorganized our reporting structure and reassigned goodwill among the revised reporting units. As a result of the management and reporting changes, we concluded that we have three reporting units for our European operations: (1) the United Kingdom, Ireland and Norway ("UKI"); (2) Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Spain ("Western Europe"); and (3) the remaining countries in Europe ("Central Europe"). Due to these changes, we will perform all future goodwill impairment analysis on the new reporting unit basis. As a result of the restructuring of our reporting units, we concluded that we had an interim triggering event, and, therefore, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test for UKI, Western Europe and Central Europe in the third quarter of 2011 as of August 31, 2011. As required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), prior to our goodwill impairment analysis, we performed an impairment assessment on the long lived assets within our UKI, Western Europe and Central Europe reporting units and noted no impairment, except for the Italian Business, which was included in our Western Europe reporting unit, and which is now included in discontinued operations. See Note 14 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Based on our analyses, we concluded that the goodwill of our UKI and Central Europe reporting units was not impaired. Our UKI and Central Europe reporting units had fair values that exceed their carrying values by 15.1% and 4.9%, respectively, as of August 31, 2011. Central Europe is still in the investment stage, and, accordingly, its fair value does not exceed its carrying value by a significant margin at this point in time. A deterioration of the UKI or Central Europe businesses or their failure to achieve the forecasted results could lead to impairments in future periods. Our Western Europe reporting units fair value was less than its carrying value, and, as a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $46.5 million included as a component of intangible impairments from continuing operations in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011. A tax benefit of approximately $5.4 million was recorded associated with the Western Europe goodwill impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2011 and is included in the provision from income taxes from continuing operations. During the quarter ended September 30, 2010, prior to our annual goodwill impairment review, we concluded that events occurred and circumstances changed in our former worldwide digital business 31 Table of Contents reporting unit that required us to conduct an impairment review. The primary factors contributing to our conclusion that we had a triggering event and a requirement to reassess our former worldwide digital business reporting unit goodwill for impairment included: (1) a reduction in forecasted revenue and operating results due to continued pressure on key parts of the business as a result of the weak economy; (2) reduced revenue and profit outlook for our eDiscovery service due to smaller average matter size and lower pricing; (3) a decision to discontinue certain software development projects; and (4) the sale of the Domain Name Product Line. As a result of the review, we recorded a provisional goodwill impairment charge associated with our former worldwide digital business reporting unit in the amount of $255.0 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2010. We finalized the estimate in the fourth quarter of 2010, and we recorded an additional impairment of $28.8 million, for a total goodwill impairment charge of $283.8 million. Based on a relative fair value basis, we allocated $85.9 million of this charge to the retained technology escrow services business which continues to be included in our continuing results of operations. Our technology escrow services business had previously been reported in the former worldwide digital business segment along with the Digital Business and the Domain Name Product Line. The technology escrow services business is now reported in the North American Business segment. Our consolidated revenues and expenses are subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenues and expenses incurred by our entities outside the U.S. In 2009, we saw decreases in both revenues and expenses as a result of the weakening of the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar and the Euro against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average exchange rates for the comparable periods. In 2010, we saw increases in both revenues and expenses as a result of the strengthening of the British pound sterling and the Canadian dollar, slightly offset by a weakening of the Euro, against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average exchange rates for the comparable periods. In 2011, we saw increases in both revenues and expenses as a result of the strengthening of the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Euro, against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average exchange rates for the comparable periods. It is difficult to predict how much foreign currency exchange rates will fluctuate in the future and how those fluctuations will impact our consolidated statement of operations. Due to the expansion of our international operations, these fluctuations have become material on individual balances. However, because both the revenues and expenses are denominated in the local currency of the country in which they are derived or incurred, the impact of currency fluctuations on our operating income and operating margin is partially mitigated. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we compare the percentage change in the results from one period to another period in this report using constant currency disclosure. The constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the 2009 results at the 2010 average exchange rates and the 2010 results at the 2011 average exchange rates. Prior to January 1, 2010, the financial position and results of operations of the operating subsidiaries of IME, our European business, were consolidated based on IMEs fiscal year ended October 31. Effective January 1, 2010, we changed the fiscal year end (and the reporting period for consolidation purposes) of IME to coincide with IMIs fiscal year end of December 31. We believe that the change in accounting principle related to the elimination of the two month reporting lag for IME is preferable because it results in more contemporaneous reporting of events and results related to IME. In accordance with applicable accounting literature, a change in a subsidiarys year end is treated as a change in accounting principle and requires retrospective application. The impact of the change was not material to the results of operations for the previously reported annual and interim periods prior to January 1, 2010, and, thus, those results have not been revised. There is, however, a charge of $4.7 million recorded to other (income) expense, net in the year ended December 31, 2010 to recognize the immaterial differences arising from the change. 32 Table of Contents The following table is a comparison of underlying average exchange rates of the foreign currencies that had the most significant impact on our U.S. dollar reported revenues and expenses: Average Exchange Rates for the Year Ended December 31, Percentage Strengthening/ (Weakening) of Foreign Currency 2010 2011 British pound sterling $ 1.546 $ 1.604 3.8 % Canadian dollar $ 0.971 $ 1.012 4.2 % Euro $ 1.328 $ 1.392 4.8 % Average Exchange Rates for the Year Ended December 31, Percentage Strengthening/ (Weakening) of Foreign Currency 2009(1) 2010 British pound sterling $ 1.544 $ 1.546 0.1 % Canadian dollar $ 0.880 $ 0.971 10.3 % Euro $ 1.366 $ 1.328 (2.8 )% (1)Corresponding to the appropriate periods based on the operating subsidiaries of IMEs fiscal year ended October 31. Non GAAP Measures Adjusted Operating Income Before Depreciation, Amortization and Intangible Impairments ("Adjusted OIBDA") Adjusted OIBDA is defined as operating income before depreciation, amortization, intangible impairments and (gain) loss on disposal/write down of property, plant and equipment, net. Adjusted OIBDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted OIBDA by total revenues. We use multiples of current or projected Adjusted OIBDA in conjunction with our discounted cash flow models to determine our overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. We believe Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Margin provide current and potential investors with relevant and useful information regarding our ability to generate cash flow to support business investment. These measures are an integral part of the internal reporting system we use to assess and evaluate the operating performance of our business. Adjusted OIBDA does not include certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results, specifically: (1) (gain) and loss on disposal/write down of property, plant and equipment, net; (2) intangible impairments; (3) other expense (income), net; (4) cumulative effect of change in accounting principle; (5) income (loss) from discontinued operations; (6) gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations; and (7) net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. Adjusted OIBDA also does not include interest expense, net and the provision (benefit) for income taxes. These expenses are associated with our capitalization and tax structures, which we do not consider when evaluating the operating profitability of our core operations. Finally, Adjusted OIBDA does not include depreciation and amortization expenses in order to eliminate the impact of capital investments, which we evaluate by comparing capital expenditures to incremental revenue generated and as a percentage of total revenues. Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Margin should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP, such as operating or net income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations (as determined in accordance with GAAP). 33 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to Operating Income; Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income (Loss) (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Adjusted OIBDA $ 676,165 $ 754,279 $ 822,579 $ 926,676 $ 934,912 Less: Depreciation and Amortization 220,217 254,497 277,186 304,205 319,499 Intangible Impairments 85,909 46,500 Loss (Gain) on Disposal/Write Down of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net (5,463 ) 7,522 168 (10,987 ) (2,286 ) Operating Income 461,411 492,260 545,225 547,549 571,199 Less: Interest Expense, Net 214,147 219,989 212,545 204,559 205,256 Other (Income) Expense, Net 4,103 31,505 (12,599 ) 8,768 13,043 Provision for Income Taxes 72,617 146,122 113,762 167,483 106,488 Income from Continuing Operations 170,544 94,644 231,517 166,739 246,412 Total (Loss) Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax (17,858 ) (14,889 ) (12,138 ) (219,417 ) 153,180 Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 920 (94 ) 1,429 4,908 4,054 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Iron Mountain Incorporated $ 151,766 $ 79,849 $ 217,950 $ (57,586 ) $ 395,538 Free Cash Flows before Acquisitions and Discretionary Investments ("FCF") FCF is defined as Cash Flows from Operating Activities Continuing Operations less capital expenditures (excluding real estate), net of proceeds from the sales of property and equipment and other, net, and additions to customer relationship and acquisition costs. Our management uses this measure when evaluating the operating performance of our consolidated business. We believe this measure provides relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors. FCF is a useful measure in determining our ability to generate excess cash that may be used for reinvestment in the business, discretionary deployment in investments such as real estate or acquisition opportunities, returning of capital to our stockholders and voluntary prepayments of indebtedness. 34 Table of Contents Reconciliation of FCF to Cash Flows from Operating Activities Continuing Operations (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Free Cash Flows before Acquisitions and Discretionary Investments $ 168,196 $ 196,522 $ 330,142 $ 370,128 $ 457,838 Add: Capital Expenditures (excluding real estate), net(1) 298,158 303,236 245,687 219,899 183,973 Additions to Customer Relationship and Acquisitions Costs 16,384 14,141 10,741 13,202 21,703 Cash Flows From Operating Activities Continuing Operations $ 482,738 $ 513,899 $ 586,570 $ 603,229 $ 663,514 Cash Flows From Investing Activities Continuing Operations $ (700,689 ) $ (421,480 ) $ (298,699 ) $ (298,458 ) $ (302,213 ) Cash Flows From Financing Activities Continuing Operations $ 461,570 $ 87,028 $ (128,286 ) $ (379,711 ) $ (762,670 ) (1)The 2010 results included approximately $11,000 incurred by IME in November and December 2009 prior to the change in its fiscal year end. Adjusted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations ("Adjusted EPS") Adjusted EPS from continuing operations is defined as reported earnings per share from continuing operations excluding: (a) (gain) loss on the disposal/write down of property, plant and equipment, net; (b) intangible impairments; (c) other expense (income), net; and (d) the tax impact of reconciling items and discrete tax items. We do not believe these excluded items to be indicative of our ongoing operating results, and they are not considered when we are forecasting our future results. We believe Adjusted EPS from continuing operations is of value to investors when comparing our results from past, present and future periods.

The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of 35 Table of Contents contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for the period then ended. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the estimates used. We base our estimates on historical experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Our critical accounting policies include the following, which are listed in no particular order: Revenue Recognition Our revenues consist of storage revenues as well as service revenues and are reflected net of sales and value added taxes. Storage revenues, which are considered a key performance indicator for the information management services industry, consist primarily of recurring periodic charges related to the storage of materials or data (generally on a per unit basis). Service revenues are comprised of charges for related core service activities and a wide array of complementary products and services. Included in core service revenues are: (1) the handling of records, including the addition of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refilling of removed records and the destruction of records; (2) courier operations, consisting primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request; (3) secure shredding of sensitive documents; and (4) other recurring services, including hybrid services and recurring project revenues. Our complementary services revenues include special project work, customer termination and permanent withdrawal fees, data restoration projects, fulfillment services, consulting services, technology services and product sales (including specially designed storage containers and related supplies). A by product of our secure shredding and destruction services is the sale of recycled paper (included in complementary services revenues), the price of which can fluctuate from period to period, adding to the volatility and reducing the predictability of that revenue stream. We recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Storage and service revenues are recognized in the month the respective storage or service is provided, and customers are generally billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed upon terms. Amounts related to future storage or prepaid service contracts for customers where storage fees or services are billed in advance are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the applicable storage or service period or when the service is performed. Revenue from the sales of products, which is included as a component of service revenues, is recognized when products are shipped to the customer and title has passed to the customer. Revenues from the sales of products have historically not been significant. Accounting for Acquisitions Part of our growth strategy has included the acquisition of numerous businesses. The purchase price of each acquisition has been determined after due diligence of the acquired business, market research, strategic planning and the forecasting of expected future results and synergies. Estimated future results and expected synergies are subject to revisions as we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources. Each acquisition has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting as defined under the applicable accounting standards at the date of each acquisition. Accounting for these acquisitions has resulted in the capitalization of the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets acquired in each of these acquisitions as goodwill. We estimated the fair values of the assets acquired in each acquisition as of the date of acquisition and these estimates are subject to adjustment based on the final assessments of the fair value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, operating leases and deferred income taxes. We complete these assessments within one year of the date of acquisition. See Note 6 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 36 Table of Contents Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Credit Memos We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments and potential disputes regarding billing and service issues. When calculating the allowance, we consider our past loss experience, current and prior trends in our aged receivables and credit memo activity, current economic conditions and specific circumstances of individual receivable balances. If the financial condition of our customers were to significantly change, resulting in a significant improvement or impairment of their ability to make payments, an adjustment of the allowance may be required. We consider accounts receivable to be delinquent after such time as reasonable means of collection have been exhausted. We charge off uncollectible balances as circumstances warrant, generally no later than one year past due. As of December 31, 2010 and 2011, our allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos balance totaled $20.7 million and $23.3 million, respectively. Impairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets Assets subject to amortization: We review long lived assets and all amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate to their carrying amount. The operations are generally distinguished by the business segment and geographic region in which they operate. If the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets, then intangible assets are written down first, followed by the other long lived assets of the operation, to fair value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending upon the nature of the assets. Goodwill Assets not subject to amortization: Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We have selected October 1 as our annual goodwill impairment review date. We performed our annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2009, 2010 and 2011 and noted no impairment of goodwill. However, as a result of interim triggering events as discussed below, we recorded provisional goodwill impairment charges in each of the third quarters of 2010 and 2011 in conjunction with the Digital Sale and associated with our European operations, respectively. These provisional goodwill impairment charges were finalized in the fourth quarters of the 2010 and 2011 fiscal years, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, no factors were identified that would alter our October 1, 2011 goodwill assessment. In making this assessment, we relied on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, anticipated future cash flows, transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. When changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units, the goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values. During the quarter ended September 30, 2010, prior to our annual goodwill impairment review, we concluded that events occurred and circumstances changed in our former worldwide digital business reporting unit that required us to conduct an impairment review. The primary factors contributing to our conclusion that we had a triggering event and a requirement to reassess our former worldwide digital business reporting unit goodwill for impairment included: (1) a reduction in forecasted revenue and operating results due to continued pressure on key parts of the business as a result of the weak economy; (2) reduced revenue and profit outlook for our eDiscovery service due to smaller average matter size and lower pricing; (3) a decision to discontinue certain software development projects; and (4) the sale of the Domain Name Product Line. As a result of the review, we recorded a provisional goodwill impairment charge associated with our former worldwide digital business reporting unit in the amount of $255.0 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2010. We finalized the estimate in the fourth quarter of 2010, and we recorded an additional impairment of $28.8 million, for a total 37 Table of Contents goodwill impairment charge of $283.8 million. For the year ended December 31, 2010, based on a relative fair value basis, we allocated $85.9 million of this charge to the retained technology escrow services business which continues to be included in our continuing results of operations. The technology escrow services business had previously been reported in the former worldwide digital business segment along with the Digital Business and the Domain Name Product Line and is now reported in the North American Business segment. In September 2011, as a result of certain changes we made in the manner in which our European operations are managed, we reorganized our reporting structure and reassigned goodwill among the revised reporting units. Previously, we tested goodwill impairment at the European level on a combined basis. As a result of the management and reporting changes, we concluded that we have three reporting units for our European operations: (1) UKI; (2) Western Europe; and (3) Central Europe. Due to these changes, we will perform all future goodwill impairment analyses on the new reporting unit basis. As a result of the restructuring of our reporting units, we concluded that we had an interim triggering event, and, therefore, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test for UKI, Western Europe and Central Europe in the third quarter of 2011 as of August 31, 2011. As required by GAAP, prior to our goodwill impairment analysis, we performed an impairment assessment on the long lived assets within our UKI, Western Europe and Central Europe reporting units and noted no impairment, except for the Italian Business, which was included in our Western Europe reporting unit, and which is now included in discontinued operations as discussed at Note 14 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Based on our analyses, we concluded that the goodwill of our UKI and Central Europe reporting units was not impaired. Our UKI and Central Europe reporting units had fair values that exceed their carrying values by 15.1% and 4.9%, respectively, as of August 31, 2011. Central Europe is still in the investment stage, and, accordingly, its fair value does not exceed its carrying value by a significant margin at this point in time. A deterioration of the UKI or Central Europe businesses or their failure to achieve the forecasted results could lead to impairments in future periods. Our Western Europe reporting units fair value was less than its carrying value, and, as a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $46.5 million included as a component of intangible impairments from continuing operations in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011. A tax benefit of approximately $5.4 million was recorded associated with the Western Europe goodwill impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2011 and is included in the provision for income taxes from continuing operations. Our reporting units at which level we performed our goodwill impairment analysis as of October 1, 2010 were as follows: North America; Europe; Latin America; Australia; Joint Ventures (which includes India, the various joint ventures in Southeast Asia and Russia (referred to as "Joint Ventures")); and Business Process Management ("BPM"). Given their similar economic characteristics, products, customers and processes, (1) the United Kingdom, Ireland and Norway and (2) the countries of Continental Europe (excluding Joint Ventures), each a reporting unit, have been aggregated as Europe and tested as one for goodwill impairment. As of December 31, 2010, the carrying value of goodwill, net amounted to $1,750.4 million, $438.3 million, $29.8 million and $61.0 million for North America, Europe, Latin America and Australia, respectively. Our Joint Ventures and BPM reporting units had no goodwill as of December 31, 2010. Our reporting units at which level we performed our goodwill impairment analysis as of October 1, 2011 were as follows: North America; UKI; Western Europe; Central Europe; Latin America; Australia; and Joint Ventures. As of December 31, 2011, the carrying value of goodwill, net amounted to $1,748.9 million, $306.2 million, $46.4 million, $63.8 million, $27.3 million, and $61.7 million for North America, UKI, Western Europe, Central Europe, Latin America and Australia, respectively. Our Joint Ventures reporting unit has no goodwill as of December 31, 2011. Our North America, Latin America and Australia reporting units had estimated fair values as of October 1, 2011 that exceeded their carrying value by greater than 40%. 38 Table of Contents Reporting unit valuations have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit or a combined approach based on the present value of future cash flows and market and transaction multiples of revenues and earnings. The income approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors, expected capital expenditures and income tax cash flows. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. In conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment reviews, we reconcile the sum of the valuations of all of our reporting units to our market capitalization as of such dates. Accounting for Internal Use Software We develop various software applications for internal use. Computer software costs associated with internal use software are expensed as incurred until certain capitalization criteria are met. Payroll and related costs for employees who are directly associated with, and who devote time to, the development of internal use computer software projects (to the extent time is spent directly on the project) are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the software. Capitalization begins when the design stage of the application has been completed and it is probable that the application will be completed and used to perform the function intended. Depreciation begins when the software is placed in service. Computer software costs that are capitalized are periodically evaluated for impairment. It may be necessary for us to write off amounts associated with the development of internal use software if the project cannot be completed as intended. We may be required to write off unamortized costs or shorten the estimated useful life if an internal use software program is replaced with an alternative tool prior to the end of the softwares estimated useful life. Capitalized labor net of accumulated depreciation was $33.7 million as of both December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. See Note 2.f. to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2011, we wrote off $0.6 million (primarily in Corporate) and $3.5 million (approximately $3.1 million associated with our International Business segment and approximately $0.4 million associated with our North American Business segment), respectively, of previously deferred software costs associated with internal use software development projects that were discontinued after implementation, which resulted in a loss on disposal/write down of property, plant and equipment, net in each of these years. Income Taxes We recorded a valuation allowance, amounting to $72.2 million as of December 31, 2011, to reduce our deferred tax assets, primarily associated with certain state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards, to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have federal net operating loss carryforwards which begin to expire in 2020 through 2025 of $28.2 million ($9.9 million, tax effected) at December 31, 2011 to reduce future federal taxable income. We have an asset for state net operating losses of $7.9 million (net of federal tax benefit), which begins to expire in 2012 through 2025, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 99%. We have assets for foreign net operating losses of $40.3 million, with various expiration dates, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 69%. We also have foreign tax credits of $56.6 million, which begin to expire in 2014 through 2019, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 65%. U.S. legislative changes in 2010 reduced the expected utilization of foreign tax credits which resulted in the requirement for a valuation allowance. If actual results differ unfavorably from certain of our estimates used, we may not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred income tax assets and foreign tax credit carryforwards, and additional valuation allowances may be required. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that our estimates reflected in the tax provisions and accruals will equal our actual results. These differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. 39 Table of Contents The evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two step process. The first step is a recognition process whereby the company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step is a measurement process whereby a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. As of December 31, 2010 and 2011, we had approximately $59.9 million and $31.4 million, respectively, of reserves related to uncertain tax positions. The reversal of these reserves will be recorded as a reduction of our income tax provision if sustained. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in favorable or unfavorable changes in our estimates. We have elected to recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of the provision (benefit) for income taxes. We recorded $4.7 million, $(1.6) million and $(8.5) million for gross interest and penalties for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively. We had $11.6 million and $2.8 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of December 31, 2010 and 2011, respectively. We have not provided deferred taxes on book basis differences related to certain foreign subsidiaries because such basis differences are not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future and we intend to reinvest indefinitely outside the U.S. These basis differences arose primarily through the undistributed book earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The basis differences could be reversed through a sale of the subsidiaries, the receipt of dividends from subsidiaries and certain other events or actions on our part, each of which would result in an increase in our provision for income taxes. It is not practicable to calculate the amount of such basis differences. Stock Based Compensation We record stock based compensation expense, utilizing the straight line method, for the cost of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units and shares of stock issued under the employee stock purchase plan. Stock based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011 was $18.7 million, including $3.5 million in discontinued operations, ($14.7 million after tax or $0.07 per basic and diluted share), $20.4 million, including $3.1 million in discontinued operations, ($15.7 million after tax or $0.08 per basic and diluted share) and $17.5 million, including $0.3 million in discontinued operations, ($8.8 million after tax or $0.05 per basic and diluted share), respectively. The fair values of option grants are estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatility and the expected term are the input factors to that model which require the most significant management judgment. Expected volatility is calculated utilizing daily historical volatility over a period that equates to the expected life of the option. The expected life (estimated period of time outstanding) of the stock options granted is estimated using the historical exercise behavior of employees. Self Insured Liabilities We are self insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers compensation claims, vehicle accidents, property and general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee healthcare 40 Table of Contents and short term disability programs. At December 31, 2010 and 2011, there were approximately $43.9 million and $39.4 million, respectively, of self insurance accruals reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. The measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historical cost experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. We account for these costs primarily through actuarial methods, which develop estimates of the undiscounted liability for claims incurred, including those claims incurred but not reported. These methods provide estimates of future ultimate claim costs based on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. We believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals. However, the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known. We believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are appropriate. Nevertheless, changes in healthcare costs, severity, and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2011 08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment. ASU 2011 08 allows but does not require entities to first assess qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative two step impairment test is required; otherwise, no further testing is required. ASU 2011 08 is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this ASU 2011 08 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

(2)Our internal revenue growth rate represents the weighted average year over year growth rate of our revenues after removing the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We calculate internal revenue growth in local currency for our international operations. Our consolidated storage revenues increased $84.3 million, or 5.3%, to $1,683.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 and $64.9 million, or 4.2%, to $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, in comparison to the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2011 is comprised of internal revenue growth of 3.1%. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations added approximately 1.4% to our storage revenue growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2011. Net acquisitions/divestitures contributed 0.8% of the increase in reported storage revenues in 2011. Our consolidated storage revenue growth in 2011 was driven by continued solid storage growth in the International Business segment and consistent volume and price increases in our North American Business segment. The growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to 2009 is comprised of internal revenue growth of 3.1%. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations added 1.1% to our storage revenue growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2010. Our consolidated storage revenue growth was moderated in 2010 by economic factors, resulting in reduced average net pricing gains in North America due to the low inflationary environment, episodic destructions in the physical data protection business and lower new sales and higher destruction rates in our North American Business segment, which were offset by new sales in international markets. 43  Table of Contents Consolidated service revenues, consisting of core service and complementary services, increased $38.1 million, or 2.9%, to $1,331.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $1,293.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Service revenue internal growth was 0.4% driven by complementary service revenue internal growth of 3.7% in 2011, partially offset by negative core service revenue internal growth of 0.8% in 2011. Complementary service revenues increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to $25.8 million of additional revenue generated from the sale of recycled paper due, in part, to increases in paper prices. Paper prices, however, declined significantly during the fourth quarter of 2011 and into 2012. Should paper prices remain at their current levels throughout 2012, we would expect revenues from the sale of recycled paper to be lower in 2012 than in 2011. Core service revenue internal growth in the year ended December 31, 2011 continued to be constrained by current economic trends and pressures on activity based service revenues related to the handling and transportation of items in storage. These decreases were partially offset by strong hybrid revenue growth and higher fuel surcharges. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations increased reported service revenues by 1.7% in 2011 over the same period in 2010. Net acquisitions/divestitures contributed 0.8% of the increase in reported service revenues in 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. Consolidated service revenues, consisting of core service and complementary services, increased $53.0 million, or 4.3%, to $1,293.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $1,240.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Service revenue internal growth was 3.0% as complementary service revenue internal growth of 15.6% in 2010 was offset by negative core service revenue internal growth of 0.9% in 2010. Complementary service revenues increased in 2010 primarily due to $36.8 million more revenue resulting from higher recycled paper pricing and gains in hybrid service revenues in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Core service revenue internal growth in the year ended December 31, 2010 was constrained by economic trends and pressures on activity based service revenues related to the handling and transportation of items in storage. Favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 increased reported service revenues 1.3%. For the reasons stated above, our consolidated revenues increased $122.4 million, or 4.2%, to $3,014.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $2,892.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recorded reductions to reported revenues of $6.0 million, $6.0 million and $4.8 million, respectively, related to a billing error involving a government contract. See Note 2.y. to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We calculate internal revenue growth in local currency for our international operations. Internal revenue growth was 1.9% for 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2011, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations increased our consolidated revenues by 1.5% primarily due to the strengthening of the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Euro against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. Net acquisitions/divestitures contributed 0.8% of the increase in total reported revenues in 2011 over the same period in 2010. Our consolidated revenues increased $118.0 million, or 4.3%, to $2,892.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $2,774.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Internal revenue growth was 3.1% for 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2010, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations increased our reported revenues by 1.2% primarily due to the strengthening of the British pound sterling and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, offset by the weakening of the Euro against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. 44 Table of Contents Internal Growth Eight Quarter Trend 2010 2011 First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Storage Revenue 4.3 % 3.7 % 2.3 % 2.3 % 3.0 % 2.8 % 3.3 % 3.3 % Service Revenue 4.5 % 2.4 % 3.9 % 1.1 % (0.1 )% 1.2 % 1.8 % (1.4 )% Total Revenue 4.4 % 3.1 % 3.0 % 1.8 % 1.6 % 2.1 % 2.6 % 1.2 % We expect our consolidated internal revenue growth for 2012 to be approximately (1)% to 2%. During the past eight quarters our storage revenue internal growth rate has ranged between 2.3% and 4.3%. Our storage revenue growth rate moderated in late 2009 and into 2010 due to the economic downturn, which resulted in reduced average net pricing gains in North America due to the low inflationary environment, episodic destructions in the physical data protection business and lower new sales and higher destruction rates in our North American Business segment. These impacts were offset by new sales in international markets. Our storage growth rate in 2011 was driven by continued solid storage growth in the International Business segment and sustained growth in our North American Business segment. The internal revenue growth rate for service revenue is inherently more volatile than the storage revenue internal growth rate due to the more discretionary nature of certain complementary services we offer, such as large special projects, and the volatility of prices for recycled paper. These revenues, which are often event driven and impacted to a greater extent by economic downturns as customers defer or cancel the purchase of certain services as a way to reduce their short term costs, may be difficult to replicate in future periods. As a commodity, recycled paper prices are subject to the volatility of that market. The revenue internal growth rate for service revenues reflects the following: (1) pressures on activity based service revenues related to the handling and transportation of items in storage and secure shredding; (2) the expected softness in our complementary service revenues, such as project revenues and fulfillment services; and (3) improvement in commodity prices for recycled paper during the first half of fiscal year 2011 and higher fuel surcharges.

For the year ended December 31, 2011, labor expense was unfavorably impacted by 1.8 percentage points due to currency rate changes. Excluding (1) the effect of currency rate fluctuations and (2) the impact associated with labor cost accruals related to the Brazilian litigation, in which a charge of $7.4 million was recorded in 2010 and a benefit of $3.5 million was recorded in 2011, labor expense increased by 2.6% in 2011 over 2010 primarily due to increased incentive compensation of $8.0 million as well as increased health insurance expenses of $5.0 million. Labor expense decreased to 20.1% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 21.2% for the year ended December 31, 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, labor expense was unfavorably impacted by 1.0 percentage points due to currency rate changes. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, labor expense decreased by 2.3% in 2010 primarily due to productivity gains in our North American Business segment, lower core service levels and lower incentive compensation expense of $12.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2010. Facilities Facilities costs were flat at 14.0% of consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. Facilities costs were unfavorably impacted by 1.7 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2011. The largest component of our facilities cost is rent expense, which, on a reported dollar basis, decreased to 12.5% of consolidated storage revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 13.0% in the same period in 2010. Other facilities costs increased by approximately $10.1 million, in constant currency terms, for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to increased building maintenance costs of $6.9 million and increased insurance costs of $5.4 million. Facilities costs decreased to 14.0% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 14.6% for the year ended December 31, 2009. Facilities costs were unfavorably impacted by 0.7 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2010. The largest component of our facilities cost is rent expense, which decreased on a reported dollar basis to 13.0% of consolidated storage revenues in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 13.4% in the same period in 2009. Other facilities costs decreased by approximately $2.0 million, in constant currency terms, for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to decreased building maintenance charges of $2.2 million. 46 Table of Contents Transportation Transportation expenses were unfavorably impacted by 2.0 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2011. Transportation expenses increased by $15.7 million in constant currency terms during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. The increase in transportation costs was primarily a result of increased third party transportation costs of $7.1 million, increased fuel costs of $6.3 million and increased vehicle repair, rental and insurance costs of $2.0 million. Transportation expenses were unfavorably impacted by 0.6 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2010. Transportation expenses decreased by $3.1 million in constant currency terms during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. A decrease of $3.3 million in vehicle lease expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009 was due to the capitalization of leased vehicles upon renewal. The lease cost did not change, but the categorization of charges did, resulting in the cost now being allocated to depreciation and interest. Product Cost of Sales and Other Product cost of sales and other, which includes cartons, media and other service, storage and supply costs, is highly correlated to complementary revenue streams. These costs were unfavorably impacted by 2.1 percentage points of currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2011. For 2011, product cost of sales and other increased by $3.8 million as compared to 2010 on an actual basis. Product cost of sales and other was unfavorably impacted by 3.5 percentage points of currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2010. For 2010, these costs decreased by $0.1 million as compared to 2009 on an actual basis.

General and administrative expenses were unfavorably impacted by 1.5 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2011. In constant currency terms, general and administrative expenses increased by $17.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. The increase was primarily attributable to $15.0 million of advisory fees and other costs in the first and second quarter of 2011 associated with our 2011 proxy contest and a $16.1 million increase in incentive compensation, partially offset by a reduction of $16.2 million in other professional fees within North America related to productivity investments incurred in 2010 and which did not repeat in 2011. General and administrative expenses decreased to 15.4% of consolidated revenues in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 15.6% in the year ended December 31, 2009. General and administrative expenses were unfavorably impacted by 0.8 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2010. In constant currency terms, general and administrative expenses increased by $9.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009. The increase was primarily attributable to increased compensation expense of $8.8 million. The increased compensation during the year ended December 31, 2010 is primarily a result of merit increases, increased medical and other benefits, as well as increased headcount primarily related to our continued investment in our hybrid records management services of $19.6 million, all of which were partially offset by a reduction in incentive compensation of $10.9 million. Sales, Marketing & Account Management Sales, marketing and account management expenses were unfavorably impacted by 1.8 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2011. In constant currency terms, the increase of $26.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 is primarily related to increased sales and marketing expenses, primarily related to a planned incremental investment of $20.0 million within North America to sustain the revenue annuity, primarily resulting in increased compensation of $23.9 million, due to increased sales commissions, payroll tax expenses and incentive compensation. Sales, marketing and account management expenses were unfavorably impacted by 1.5 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2010. In constant currency terms, the increase of $5.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 is primarily related to $2.9 million of increased marketing costs and $1.5 million of increased professional fees. 48 Table of Contents Information Technology Information technology expenses were unfavorably impacted by 1.5 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2011. In constant currency terms, information technology expenses increased $8.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 due primarily to an increase in incentive compensation and related payroll taxes of $6.1 million and health insurance and other benefit costs of $2.9 million. Information technology expenses were favorably impacted by 0.3 percentage point due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2010. In constant currency terms, information technology expenses increased $0.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily a result of increased overhead expenses of $5.4 million, partially offset by decreased compensation of $5.3 million, which offset was driven by lower incentive compensation. Bad Debt Expense Consolidated bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased $2.3 million to $9.5 million (0.3% of consolidated revenues) from $11.8 million (0.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010.

Consolidated bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $2.8 million to $11.8 million (0.4% of consolidated revenues) from $9.0 million (0.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009. Depreciation, Amortization, and (Gain) Loss on Disposal/Write down of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net Depreciation expense increased $11.9 million and $25.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, primarily due to additional depreciation expense related to capital expenditures and acquisitions, including storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems, hardware and software, and buildings primarily in our International Business segment. Amortization expense increased $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to an increase of customer relationship intangible assets acquired related to the Poland acquisition. Amortization expense increased $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to the increased amortization of intangible assets, such as customer relationship intangible assets acquired through business combinations. Consolidated gain on disposal/write down of property, plant and equipment, net of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 consisted primarily of (a) a gain of approximately $3.2 million related to the disposition of a facility in Canada and (b) a gain of approximately $3.0 million on the retirement of leased vehicles accounted for as capital lease assets in North America, offset by (c) a loss associated with discontinued use of certain third party software licenses of approximately $3.5 million (approximately $3.1 million associated with our International Business segment and approximately $0.4 million associated with our North American Business segment). Consolidated gain on disposal/write down of property, plant and equipment, net of $11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 consisted primarily of a gain of approximately $10.2 million as a result of the settlement with our insurers in connection with a portion of the property component of our claim related to the Chilean 49 Table of Contents earthquake in the third and fourth quarter of 2010, gains of approximately $3.2 million in North America primarily related to the disposition of certain owned equipment and a gain on disposal of a building in our International Business segment of approximately $1.3 million in the United Kingdom, offset by approximately $1.0 million of asset write downs associated with our Latin American operations and approximately $2.6 million of impairment losses primarily related to certain owned facilities in North America. Consolidated loss on disposal/write down of property, plant and equipment, net of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, consisted primarily of a gain on disposal of a building in our International Business segment of approximately $1.9 million in France, offset by losses on the write down of certain facilities of approximately $1.0 million in our North American Business segment, $0.7 million in our International Business segment and $0.3 million in Corporate (associated with discontinued products after implementation). Intangible Impairments During the quarter ended September 30, 2010, prior to our annual goodwill impairment review, we concluded that events occurred and circumstances changed in our former worldwide digital business reporting unit that required us to conduct an impairment review. The primary factors contributing to our conclusion that we had a triggering event and a requirement to reassess our former worldwide digital business reporting unit goodwill for impairment included: (1) a reduction in forecasted revenue and operating results due to continued pressure on key parts of the business as a result of the weak economy; (2) reduced revenue and profit outlook for our eDiscovery service due to smaller average matter size and lower pricing; (3) a decision to discontinue certain software development projects; and (4) the sale of the Domain Name Product Line. As a result of the review, we recorded a provisional goodwill impairment charge associated with our former worldwide digital business reporting unit in the amount of $255.0 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2010. We finalized the estimate in the fourth quarter of 2010, and we recorded an additional impairment of $28.8 million, for a total goodwill impairment charge of $283.8 million. Based on a relative fair value basis, we allocated $85.9 million of this charge to the retained technology escrow services business, which continues to be included in our continuing results of operations. We retained our technology escrow services business, which had previously been reported in the former worldwide digital business segment along with the Digital Business and the Domain Name Product Line. The technology escrow services business is now reported in the North American Business segment. In September 2011, as a result of certain changes we made in the manner in which our European operations are managed, we reorganized our reporting structure and reassigned goodwill among the revised reporting units. As a result of the management and reporting changes, we concluded that we have three reporting units for our European operations: (1) UKI; (2) Western Europe; and (3) Central Europe. Due to these changes, we will perform all future goodwill impairment analysis on the new reporting unit basis. As a result of the restructuring of our reporting units, we concluded that we had an interim triggering event, and, therefore, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test for UKI, Western Europe and Central Europe in the third quarter of 2011 as of August 31, 2011. As required by GAAP, prior to our goodwill impairment analysis, we performed an impairment assessment on the long lived assets within our UKI, Western Europe and Central Europe reporting units and noted no impairment, except for the Italian Business, which was included in our Western Europe reporting unit, and which is now included in discontinued operations below. Based on our analyses, we concluded that the goodwill of our UKI and Central Europe reporting units was not impaired. Our Western Europe reporting units fair value was less than its carrying value, and, as a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $46.5 million included as a component of intangible impairments from continuing operations in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011. 50 Table of Contents OPERATING INCOME and ADJUSTED OIBDA As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated operating income increased $23.7 million, or 4.3%, to $571.2 million (18.9% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $547.5 million (18.9% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010. As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated Adjusted OIBDA increased $8.2 million, or 0.9%, to $934.9 million (31.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $926.7 million (32.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010. As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated operating income increased $2.3 million, or 0.4%, to $547.5 million (18.9% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $545.2 million (19.7% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009. As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated Adjusted OIBDA increased $104.1 million, or 12.7%, to $926.7 million (32.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $822.6 million (29.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009. OTHER EXPENSES, NET Interest Expense, Net Consolidated interest expense, net increased $0.7 million to $205.3 million (6.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $204.6 million (7.1% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily due to the issuance of $400.0 million in aggregate principal of our 73/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2019 (the "73/4% Notes due 2019") in September 2011, which was partially offset by the early retirement of $431.3 million of our 73/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015 (the "73/4% Notes due 2015") during late 2010 and early 2011. We expect that our interest expense will increase in fiscal year 2012 compared to 2011 as a result of the issuance of our 73/4% Notes due 2019 as part of a planned increase in leverage to the midpoint of our 3x4x target leverage ratio range. Our weighted average interest rate was 6.9% at both December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 and 7.0% at December 31, 2009. Consolidated interest expense, net decreased $8.0 million to $204.6 million (7.1% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $212.5 million (7.7% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to a reduction in year over year short term borrowings on our revolving credit facility, as well as a reduction in our outstanding borrowings due to the early retirement of $200.0 million of our 73/4% Notes due 2015 during 2010. Other (Income) Expense, Net (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, Dollar Change 2010 2011 Foreign currency transaction losses (gains), net $ 5,664 $ 17,352 $ 11,688 Debt extinguishment expense, net 1,792 993 (799 ) Other, net 1,312 (5,302 ) (6,614 ) $ 8,768 $ 13,043 $ 4,275 51 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, Dollar Change 2009 2010 Foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, net $ (12,845 ) $ 5,664 $ 18,509 Debt extinguishment expense, net 3,031 1,792 (1,239 ) Other, net (2,785 ) 1,312 4,097 $ (12,599 ) $ 8,768 $ 21,367 Net foreign currency transaction losses of $17.4 million, based on period end exchange rates, were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2011. Losses were primarily a result of British pound sterling denominated debt and forward foreign currency swap contracts and changes in the exchange rate of the Euro, Russian Ruble and certain Latin American currencies against the U.S. dollar compared to December 31, 2010, as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with and between our European and Latin American subsidiaries. Partially offsetting these losses were gains which resulted primarily from our Euro denominated bonds issued by IMI as well as changes in the exchange rate of the British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar compared to December 31, 2010, as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with and between our United Kingdom subsidiaries. Net foreign currency transaction losses of $5.7 million, based on period end exchange rates, were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2010. Losses resulted primarily from changes in the exchange rate of the British pounds sterling, the Euro and the Russian Ruble, offset by the Brazilian Real, against the U.S. dollar compared to December 31, 2009, as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with and between our European and Latin American subsidiaries, and gains associated with our British pound sterling forward contracts, British pound sterling denominated debt and Euro denominated debt issued by IMI. Net foreign currency transaction gains of $12.9 million, based on period end exchange rates, were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2009. Gains resulted primarily from changes in the exchange rate of the British pounds sterling, Euro, Brazilian Real and Chilean Peso against the U.S. dollar compared to December 31, 2008, as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with and between our European and Latin American subsidiaries, offset by losses as a result of British pounds sterling and Euro denominated debt and forward foreign currency swap contracts held by our U.S. parent company. During the year ended December 31, 2011 we recorded a gain of approximately $0.9 million in the first quarter of 2011 related to the early extinguishment of $231.3 million of our 73/4% Notes due 2015 that were redeemed. This gain consists of original issue premiums, net of deferred financing costs related to our 73/4% Notes due 2015 that were redeemed. Additionally, we recorded a charge of $1.8 million in the second quarter of 2011 related to the early retirement of our previous revolving credit and term loan facilities, representing a write off of deferred financing costs. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we redeemed $200.0 million of the $431.3 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 73/4% Notes due 2015 at a redemption price of $1,012.92 for each one thousand dollars of principal amount of the notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We recorded a charge to other expense (income), net of $1.8 million in the third quarter of 2010 related to the early extinguishment of our 73/4% Notes due 2015 that were redeemed. This charge consists of the call premium and deferred financing costs, net of original issue premiums related to our 73/4% Notes due 2015 that were redeemed. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we redeemed our 85/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 and wrote off $3.0 million in associated deferred financing costs. Other, net for the year ended December 31, 2011 was a gain of $5.3 million, which primarily consists of a $5.9 million gain associated with the fair valuing of the 20% equity interest that we previously held in our Polish joint venture in connection with our acquisition of the remaining 80% 52 Table of Contents interest in January 2011. Other, net in the year ended December 31, 2010 was a $1.3 million loss. Included in the loss for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $4.7 million of losses related to the impact of the change in IMEs fiscal year end. Since its inception, IME had operated with an October 31 fiscal year end. IMEs financial results had historically been consolidated with IMIs results with a two month lag. In order to better align our European processes with the enterprise, effective January 1, 2010, the IME fiscal year end was changed to December 31 to match the Companys fiscal year end. The $4.7 million charge represents the net impact of this change for the two years ended December 31, 2009. Partially offsetting this loss was $1.2 million of gains related to certain trading marketable securities held in a trust for the benefit of employees included in a deferred compensation plan we sponsor. Other, net in the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily consisted of $1.7 million of gains related to certain trading marketable securities held in a trust for the benefit of employees included in a deferred compensation plan we sponsor, in addition to $0.6 million of business interruption proceeds for an owned storage facility in France, which was taken by eminent domain in the first quarter of 2009. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011 were 32.9%, 50.1% and 30.2%, respectively. The primary reconciling items between the federal statutory rate of 35% and our overall effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2011 was the recognition of certain previously unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions of prior years, expirations of statute of limitation periods and settlements with tax authorities in various jurisdictions and differences in the rates of tax at which our foreign earnings are subject, including foreign exchange gains and losses in different jurisdictions with different tax rates. This benefit was partially offset by state income taxes (net of federal benefit). Additionally, to a lesser extent, a goodwill impairment charge included in income from continuing operations as a component of intangible impairments in our consolidated statements of operations, of which a majority was non deductible for tax purposes, is a reconciling item that impacts our effective tax rate. The primary reconciling item between the federal statutory rate of 35% and our overall effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 is a goodwill impairment charge included in income from continuing operations as a component of intangible impairments in our consolidated statements of operations, of which a majority was non deductible for tax purposes. The negative impact of U.S. legislative changes reducing the expected utilization of foreign tax credits was offset by the recognition of certain previously unrecognized tax benefits due to expirations of statute of limitation periods and settlements with tax authorities in various jurisdictions. Additionally, to a lesser extent, state income taxes (net of federal benefit) and differences in the rates of tax at which our foreign earnings are subject, including foreign exchange gains and losses in different jurisdictions with different tax rates, are also reconciling items and impact our effective tax rate. In 2009, we had significant unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on intercompany loans and on debt and derivative instruments in different jurisdictions with different tax rates. For 2009, foreign currency gains were recorded in lower tax jurisdictions associated with the marking to market of intercompany loan positions while foreign currency losses were recorded in higher tax jurisdictions associated with the marking to market of debt and derivative instruments, which reduced the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2009. Our effective tax rate is subject to variability in the future due to, among other items: (1) changes in the mix of income from foreign jurisdictions; (2) tax law changes; (3) volatility in foreign exchange gains and (losses); (4) the timing of the establishment and reversal of tax reserves; and (5) our ability to utilize foreign tax credits that we generate. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. Although we believe our tax estimates are 53 Table of Contents appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in changes in our estimates. Discrete items are recorded in the period they occur. INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased $79.7 million, or 47.8%, to $246.4 million (8.2% of consolidated revenues) from income from continuing operations of $166.7 million (5.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in income from continuing operations is primarily due to the year over year decrease of our provision for income taxes as described above and the goodwill impairment charge recorded in fiscal year 2010 associated with our technology escrow services business, which was previously a component of our former worldwide digital business segment, partially offset by the goodwill impairment charge recorded in fiscal year 2011 associated with our Western Europe reporting unit, as well as, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the year over year change in the (gain) loss on disposal/write down of property, plant and equipment, net. As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased $64.8 million, or 28.0%, to $166.7 million (5.8% of consolidated revenues) from income from continuing operations of $231.5 million (8.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in income from continuing operations is primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge associated with our technology escrow services business, which was previously a component of our former worldwide digital business segment, as well as, foreign currency exchange rate impacts and the impact of the change in IMEs fiscal year end included in other (income) expense, net and the impact of our tax rate for 2010 and the resulting increase in the provision for income taxes described above. INCOME (LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND GAIN (LOSS) ON SALE OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Loss from discontinued operations was $(12.1) million, $(219.4) million and $(47.4) million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively. We recorded a goodwill impairment charge associated with our former worldwide digital business reporting unit in the amount of $197.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 net of the amount allocated to the retained technology escrow services business, based on a relative fair value basis, which continues to be included in our continuing results of operations as previously discussed above. During 2011, we recorded an impairment charge of $4.9 million to write down the long lived assets of the New Zealand Business to its estimated net realizable value which is included in loss from discontinued operations. Additionally, we recorded a tax benefit of $7.9 million during 2011 associated with the outside tax basis of the New Zealand Business, which is also reflected in income (loss) from discontinued operations. Additionally, in conjunction with the goodwill impairment analysis performed associated with our Western Europe reporting unit, we performed an impairment test on the long lived assets of our Italian Business in the third quarter of 2011. The undiscounted cash flows from the Italian Business were lower than the carrying value of the long lived assets associated with the operations of the Italian Business and resulted in the requirement to fair value the long lived assets of this lower level component. As a result, we recorded write offs of other intangible assets, primarily customer relationship values of $8.0 million, and certain write downs to property, plant and equipment (primarily racking) long lived assets in Italy of $6.6 million in the third quarter of 2011, which are included in loss from discontinued operations. We allocated $2.5 million of the Western Europe goodwill impairment charge to the Italian Business which is included in loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2011. Pursuant to the Digital Sale Agreement, we received approximately $395.4 million in cash, consisting of the initial purchase price of $380.0 million and a preliminary working capital adjustment of approximately $15.4 million, which remains subject to a customary post closing adjustment based on 54 Table of Contents the amount of working capital at closing. The purchase price for the Digital Sale will be increased on a dollar for dollar basis if the working capital balance at the time of closing exceeds the target amount of working capital as set forth in the Digital Sale Agreement and decreased on a dollar for dollar basis if such closing working capital balance is less than the target amount. We and Autonomy are in disagreement regarding the working capital adjustment in the Digital Sale Agreement. As a result, as contemplated by the Digital Sale Agreement, the matter is being referred to an independent third party accounting firm for determination of the appropriate adjustment amount. Transaction costs relating to the Digital Sale amounted to approximately $7.4 million. Additionally, $11.1 million of inducements are payable to Autonomy and have been netted against the proceeds in calculating the gain on the Digital Sale. Also, a tax provision of $45.1 million associated with the gain recorded on the Digital Sale was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2011. A gain on sale of discontinued operations in the amount of $243.9 million ($198.7 million, net of tax) was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2011, as a result of the Digital Sale. We completed the sale of the New Zealand Business on October 3, 2011 for a purchase price of approximately $10.0 million. We recorded a gain on the sale of discontinued operations associated with the New Zealand Business of approximately $1.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2011. A gain on sale of discontinued operations of approximately $6.9 million ($2.8 million, net of tax) was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2010 associated with the divestiture of the Domain Name Product Line. NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS For the year ended December 31, 2011, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests resulted in a decrease in net income attributable to Iron Mountain Incorporated of $4.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2010, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests resulted in a decrease in net income attributable to Iron Mountain Incorporated of $4.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 2009, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests resulted in a reduction to net income attributable to Iron Mountain Incorporated of $1.4 million. These amounts represent our noncontrolling partners share of earnings/losses in our majority owned international subsidiaries that are consolidated in our operating results. Segment Analysis (in thousands) As a result of the disposition of our Digital Business and New Zealand Business and our decision to sell the Italian Business as discussed in Note 14 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we changed our reportable segments. The most significant of these changes is that the reportable segment previously referred to as the worldwide digital business is no longer reported separately in our management reporting as the operations associated with the Domain Name Product Line and the Digital Business are reported as discontinued operations. Also, the technology escrow services business, which we continue to own and operate and was previously reported in the former worldwide digital business segment, is now reported in the North American Business segment. Additionally, the International Business segment no longer includes the New Zealand Business and the Italian Business as these operations are reported as discontinued operations. Our reportable operating segments are North American Business, International Business and Corporate. See Note 9 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our North American Business segment offers information management services throughout the United States and Canada, including the storage of paper documents, as well as other media such as microfilm and microfiche, master audio and videotapes, film, X rays and blueprints, including healthcare information services, vital records services, service and courier operations, and the collection, handling and disposal of sensitive documents for corporate customers ("Hard Copy"); the storage and rotation of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster recovery plans, including service and courier operations ("Data Protection"); information destruction services ("Destruction"); the scanning, imaging and document 55 Table of Contents conversion services of active and inactive records ("Hybrid Services"); the storage, assembly, and detailed reporting of customer marketing literature and delivery to sales offices, trade shows and prospective customers sites based on current and prospective customer orders ("Fulfillment"), and technology escrow services that protect and manage source code. Our International Business segment offers information management services throughout Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific, including Hard Copy, Data Protection, Destruction and Hybrid Services. Corporate consists of costs related to executive and staff functions, including finance, human resources and information technology, which benefit the enterprise as a whole. These costs are primarily related to the general management of these functions on a corporate level and the design and development of programs, policies and procedures that are then implemented in the individual segments, with each segment bearing its own cost of implementation. Corporate also includes stock based employee compensation expense associated with all employee stock based awards.

During the year ended December 31, 2011, revenue in our North American Business segment increased 1.6% over the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to internal growth of 1.1%. Internal growth was due to storage internal growth of 2.2% related to increased new sales and lower volume outflows, partially offset by total service internal growth of negative 0.3%. Our core service revenues were constrained by lower service and activity levels partially offset by higher fuel surcharges, yielding negative internal growth of 1.4% for the year ended December 31, 2011, while our complementary service revenue yielded 2.5% internal growth as a result of higher pricing of recycled paper, as well as improved special project and product sales. Additionally, favorable foreign currency rate changes related to the Canadian dollar resulted in increased 2011 revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, of 0.4% for the year ended December 31, 2011. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue decreased for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 due mainly to increases in sales and marketing expenses of $27.5 million, inclusive of a planned incremental investment of $20.0 million to sustain the revenue annuity, and higher incentive compensation accruals of $20.6 million, partially offset by a constant currency increase in revenue of 56 Table of Contents $26.0 million and a reduction of $16.2 million in professional fees related to productivity investments incurred in 2010 and which did not repeat in 2011. During the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue in our North American Business segment increased 3.2% over the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to internal growth of 2.3%. Total revenue internal growth was comprised of storage internal growth of 2.3% related to increased Hard Copy and Data Protection revenues and service internal growth of 2.4%. Economic factors led to a moderation in our storage growth rate as a result of reduced average net pricing gains due to the current low inflationary environment, episodic destructions in the data protection business and lower new sales and higher destruction rates in our physical business over the past year. Core service revenue growth was also constrained by economic trends and pressures on activity based services revenues related to the handling and transportation of items in storage. Our core services business yielded negative internal growth of 2.2%, which was more than offset by complementary services revenues internal growth of 16.3%, due primarily to higher recycled paper prices and gains in hybrid service revenues. Additionally, favorable foreign currency rate changes related to Canada resulted in increased 2010 revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, of 0.9%. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue increased in 2010 due mainly to productivity gains and disciplined cost management, partially offset by a $5.5 million increase in general and administrative compensation and a $1.4 million increase in bad debt expense.

Revenue in our International Business segment increased 12.4% during the year ended December 31, 2011 over 2010 due to internal growth of 4.3% and foreign currency fluctuations in 2011, primarily in Europe, which resulted in increased 2011 revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, of approximately 5.1% as compared to 2010. Total internal revenue growth for the segment for the year ended December 31, 2011 was supported by solid 6.2% storage internal growth and total service internal growth of 2.3%. Acquisitions contributed 3.0% of the increase in total reported international revenues in the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to our acquisitions in Poland in the first 57 Table of Contents quarter of 2011 and Greece in the second quarter of 2010. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue increased in the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 primarily due to increased operating income from productivity gains, pricing actions and disciplined cost management, offset by $5.9 million of additional productivity investments. Revenue in our International Business segment increased 7.6% during the year ended December 31, 2010 over 2009 due to internal revenue growth of 5.3% supported by storage internal growth of 6.0% and core services internal growth of 2.4%. The impact of acquisitions increased reported revenue by 0.3% in 2010. Foreign currency fluctuations in 2010, primarily in Europe, resulted in increased 2010 revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, of approximately 2.0% as compared to 2009. Adjusted OIBDA increased in 2010 by $10.5 million compared to the same period in 2009 due to increased operating income from productivity gains, pricing actions and disciplined cost management, partially offset by increased compensation expense of $9.5 million primarily related to investments in our hybrid records management services, as well as one time cost accruals recorded in 2010 of approximately $7.4 million. Corporate Dollar Change Percentage Change Year Ended December 31, from 2009 to 2010 from 2010 to 2011 from 2009 to 2010 from 2010 to 2011 2009 2010 2011 Segment Adjusted OIBDA(1) $ (164,259 ) $ (173,798 ) $ (191,273 ) $ (9,539 ) $ (17,475 ) (5.8 )% (10.1 )% Segment Adjusted OIBDA(1) as a Percentage of Consolidated Revenue (5.9 )% (6.0 )% (6.3 )% (1)See Note 9 to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for definition of Adjusted OIBDA and for the basis on which allocations are made and a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to income (loss) from continuing operations before provision (benefit) for income taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2011, expenses in the Corporate segment as a percentage of consolidated revenues increased 10.1% over 2010. This increase was primarily due to $15.0 million of advisory fees and other costs associated with our 2011 proxy contest. During the year ended December 31, 2010, expenses in the Corporate segment increased 5.8% over 2009. This increase was primarily driven by increased sales, marketing and account management expenses of $6.0 million, higher professional fees of $2.2 million related to productivity and cost saving initiatives, an insurance deductible of $2.8 million associated with earthquakes, increased stock based compensation of $2.1 million and increased marketing expenses, partially offset by a reduction in incentive compensation. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following is a summary of our cash balances and cash flows (in thousands) as of and for the years ended December 31, 2009 2010 2011 Cash flows from operating activities continuing operations $ 586,570 $ 603,229 $ 663,514 Cash flows from investing activities continuing operations (298,699 ) (298,458 ) (302,213 ) Cash flows from financing activities continuing operations (128,286 ) (379,711 ) (762,670 ) Cash and cash equivalents at the end of year 446,656 258,693 179,845 58 Table of Contents Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $663.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $603.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The 10.0% increase resulted primarily from an increase in net income, excluding non cash charges of $31.3 million, a decrease in cash used for working capital of $23.9 million and a decrease in realized foreign exchange losses of $5.1 million over the same period last year. Uses of working capital are primarily related to lower taxes paid from continuing operations, excluding the $52.4 million of taxes paid as a result of the sale of our Digital Business which is classified in discontinued operations, lower amounts paid for cash interest and cash incentive compensation in fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010, partially offset by a reduction in cash collections from customers associated with accounts receivable. We expect our cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations to decrease in fiscal year 2012 as a result of a reduction in Adjusted OIBDA related to lower recycled paper revenues, combined with higher interest costs and higher incentive compensation payouts compared to fiscal year 2011. Our business requires significant capital expenditures to support our expected revenue growth and ongoing operations as well as new products and services and increased profitability. These expenditures are included in the cash flows from investing activities from continuing operations. The nature of our capital expenditures has evolved over time along with the nature of our business. We make capital expenditures to support a number of different objectives. The majority of our capital goes to support business line growth and our ongoing operations, but we also expend capital to support the development and improvement of products and services and projects designed to increase our profitability. These expenditures are generally small and more discretionary in nature. Cash paid for our capital expenditures, cash paid for acquisitions (net of cash acquired) and additions to customer acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2011 amounted to $209.2 million, $75.2 million and $21.7 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2011, capital expenditures, net, cash paid for acquisitions (net of cash acquired) and additions to customer acquisition costs were funded with cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations and cash equivalents on hand. Excluding potential future acquisitions, we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately $215.0 million in the year ending December 31, 2012. Included in our estimated capital expenditures for 2012 is approximately $25.0 million of real estate purchases. Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $762.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. During 2011, we received (i) $394.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of our 73/4% Notes due 2019; (ii) net borrowings under our revolving credit and term loan facilities and other debt of $153.8 million; and (iii) $85.7 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan. We used the proceeds from these financing transactions and cash on hand: (i) for the early retirement of $231.3 million of our 73/4% Notes due 2015; (ii) to repurchase $985.0 million of our common stock; (iii) to pay dividends in the amount of $172.6 million on our common stock; and (iv) to fund debt financing costs of $9.0 million. Our board of directors has authorized up to $1.2 billion in repurchases of our common stock. All purchases are subject to stock price, market conditions, corporate and legal requirements and other factors. As of December 31, 2011, we had a remaining amount available for repurchase under our share repurchase program of $100.7 million, which represents approximately 2% in the aggregate of our outstanding common stock based on the closing price on such date. 59 Table of Contents The following table is a summary of our repurchase activity under all of our share repurchase programs during 2011: 2011 Shares Amount(1) (In thousands) Authorizations remaining as of January 1, $ 238,532 Additional Authorizations 850,000 Repurchases paid 31,743,886 (984,469 ) Repurchases unsettled 109,532 (3,362 ) Authorization remaining as of December 31, $ 100,701 (2) (1)Amount excludes commissions paid associated with share repurchases. (2)Between January 1, 2012 and February 10, 2012, we repurchased an additional 1.1 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $34.7 million, reducing our remaining authorization to approximately $66.0 million. In February 2010, our board of directors adopted a dividend policy under which we have paid and in the future intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors. In fiscal years 2010 and 2011, our board of directors declared the following dividends: Declaration Date Dividend Per Share Record Date Total Amount Payment Date (in thousands) March 25, 2010 $ 0.0625 March 25, 2010 $ 12,720 April 15, 2010 June 4, 2010 0.0625 June 25, 2010 12,641 July 15, 2010 September 15, 2010 0.0625 September 28, 2010 12,532 October 15, 2010 December 10, 2010 0.1875 December 27, 2010 37,514 January 14, 2011 March 11, 2011 0.1875 March 25, 2011 37,601 April 15, 2011 June 10, 2011 0.2500 June 24, 2011 50,694 July 15, 2011 September 8, 2011 0.2500 September 23, 2011 46,877 October 14, 2011 December 1, 2011 0.2500 December 23, 2011 43,180 January 13, 2012 We are committed to stockholder payouts through a combination of share buybacks, ongoing quarterly dividends and potential one time dividends of approximately $2.2 billion through 2013, with approximately $1.2 billion of capital returned to stockholders by May 2012. Through February 10, 2012, we have returned approximately $1.15 billion to stockholders against these commitments. We expect to fund future payouts with cash flows from operations and borrowings under existing and potentially additional debt instruments. With regard to our levels of indebtedness, we plan to operate around the mid point of our target leverage ratio range of 3x 4x EBITDA (as defined in our revolving credit facility). Financial instruments that potentially subject us to market risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds and time deposits), restricted cash (primarily U.S. Treasuries) and accounts receivable. The only significant concentrations of liquid investments as of December 31, 2011 relate to cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash held on deposit with five global banks and one "Triple A" rated money market fund which we consider to be large, highly rated investment grade institutions. As per our risk management investment policy, we limit exposure to concentration of credit risk by limiting the amount invested in any one mutual fund or financial institution to a maximum of $50.0 million. As of December 31, 2011, our cash and cash equivalents and 60 Table of Contents restricted cash balance was $215.0 million, including a money market fund and time deposits amounting to $181.8 million. A substantial portion of the money market fund is invested in U.S. Treasuries. We are highly leveraged and expect to continue to be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future. Our consolidated debt as of December 31, 2011 was comprised of the following (in thousands): New Revolving Credit Facility(1) $ 96,000 New Term Loan Facility(1) 487,500 71/4% GBP Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 (the "71/4% Notes")(2) 233,115 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016 (the "65/8% Notes")(2) 318,025 71/2% CAD Senior Subordinated Notes due 2017 (the "Subsidiary Notes")(3) 171,273 83/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 (the "83/4% Notes")(2) 200,000 8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 (the "8% Notes")(2) 49,806 63/4% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 (the "63/4% Notes")(2) 328,750 73/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2019 (the "73/4% Notes due 2019")(2) 400,000 8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 (the "8% Notes due 2020")(2) 300,000 83/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2021 (the "83/8% Notes")(2) 548,346 Real Estate Mortgages, Capital Leases and Other (4) 220,773 Total Long term Debt 3,353,588 Less Current Portion (73,320 ) Long term Debt, Net of Current Portion $ 3,280,268 (1)The capital stock or other equity interests of most of our U.S. subsidiaries, and up to 66% of the capital stock or other equity interests of our first tier foreign subsidiaries, are pledged to secure these debt instruments, together with all intercompany obligations of foreign subsidiaries owed to us or to one of our U.S. subsidiary guarantors. (2)Collectively, the "Parent Notes". IMI is the direct obligor on the Parent Notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior subordinated basis, by substantially all of its direct and indirect wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries (the "Guarantors"). These guarantees are joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. Iron Mountain Canada Corporation ("Canada Company") and the remainder of our subsidiaries do not guarantee the Parent Notes. (3)Canada Company is the direct obligor on the Subsidiary Notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior subordinated basis, by IMI and the Guarantors. These guarantees are joint and several obligations of IMI and the Guarantors. (4)Includes (a) real estate mortgages of $5.2 million, (b) capital lease obligations of $207.3 million, and (c) other various notes and other obligations, which were assumed by us as a result of certain acquisitions, of $8.2 million. On June 27, 2011, we entered into a new credit agreement to replace the IMI revolving credit facility and the IMI term loan facility, each entered into on April 16, 2007. The new credit agreement consists of (i) revolving credit facilities under which we can borrow, subject to certain limitations as defined in the new credit agreement, up to an aggregate amount of $725.0 million (including Canadian dollars, British pounds sterling and Euros, among other currencies) (the "New Revolving Credit Facility") and (ii) a $500.0 million term loan facility (the "New Term Loan Facility," and collectively with the New Revolving Credit Facility, the "New Credit Agreement"). We have the right to increase the aggregate amount available to be borrowed under the New Credit Agreement up to a maximum of $1.8 billion. The New Revolving Credit Facility is supported by a group of 19 banks. IMI, Iron Mountain Information Management, Inc. ("IMIM"), Canada Company, IME, Iron Mountain Australia Pty Ltd., Iron Mountain Switzerland Gmbh and any other subsidiary of IMIM designated by IMIM 61 Table of Contents (the "Other Subsidiaries") may, with the consent of the administrative agent, as defined in the New Credit Agreement, borrow under certain of the following tranches of the New Revolving Credit Facility: (a) tranche one in the amount of $400.0 million is available to IMI and IMIM in U.S. dollars, British pounds sterling and Euros, (b) tranche two in the amount of $150.0 million is available to IMI or IMIM in either U.S. dollars or Canadian dollars and available to Canada Company in Canadian dollars and (c) tranche three in the amount of $175.0 million is available to IMI or IMIM and the Other Subsidiaries in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, British pounds sterling, Euros and Australian dollars, among others. The New Revolving Credit Facility terminates on June 27, 2016, at which point all revolving credit loans under such facility become due. With respect to the New Term Loan Facility, loan payments are required through maturity on June 27, 2016 in equal quarterly installments of the aggregate annual amounts based upon the following percentage of the original principal amount in the table below (except that each of the first three quarterly installments in the fifth year shall be 10% of the original principal amount and the final quarterly installment in the fifth year shall be 35% of the original principal): Year Ended Percentage June 30, 2012 5% June 30, 2013 5% June 30, 2014 10% June 30, 2015 15% June 27, 2016 65% The New Term Loan Facility may be prepaid without penalty or premium, in whole or in part, at any time. IMI and IMIM guarantee the obligations of each of the subsidiary borrowers. The capital stock or other equity interests of most of the U.S. subsidiaries, and up to 66% of the capital stock or other equity interests of our first tier foreign subsidiaries, are pledged to secure the New Credit Agreement, together with all intercompany obligations of foreign subsidiaries owed to us or to one of our U.S. subsidiary guarantors. The interest rate on borrowings under the New Credit Agreement varies depending on our choice of interest rate and currency options, plus an applicable margin, which varies based on certain financial ratios. Additionally, the New Credit Agreement requires the payment of a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility, which fee ranges from between 0.3% to 0.5% based on certain financial ratios, as well as fees associated with any outstanding letters of credit. Proceeds from the New Credit Agreement are for general corporate purposes and were used to repay the previous revolving credit and term loan facilities. We recorded a charge of $1.8 million to other expense (income), net in the second quarter of 2011 related to the early retirement of the previous revolving credit and term loan facilities, representing a write off of deferred financings costs. As of December 31, 2011, we had $96.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the New Revolving Credit Facility, all of which was denominated in U.S. dollars; we also had various outstanding letters of credit totaling $5.8 million. The remaining availability on December 31, 2011, based on IMIs leverage ratio, which is calculated based on the last 12 months earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), and other adjustments as defined in the New Credit Agreement and current external debt, under the New Revolving Credit Facility was $623.2 million. The interest rate in effect under the New Revolving Credit Facility and New Term Loan Facility was 4.0% and 2.3%, respectively, as of December 31, 2011. The New Credit Agreement, our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to complete acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger. Therefore, a change in our debt rating would not trigger a default under the New Credit Agreement, our indentures or other agreements governing our indebtedness. The New Credit Agreement, as well as our indentures, use EBITDA based calculations as primary measures of financial performance, including leverage and fixed 62 Table of Contents charge coverage ratios. IMIs revolving credit and term leverage ratio was 2.9 and 3.4 as of December 31, 2010 and 2011, respectively, compared to a maximum allowable ratio of 5.5. Similarly, our bond leverage ratio, per the indentures, was 3.4 and 3.9 as of December 31, 2010 and 2011, respectively, compared to a maximum allowable ratio of 6.5. IMIs revolving credit and term loan fixed charge coverage ratio was 1.5 as of December 31, 2011, compared to a minimum allowable ratio of 1.2. Noncompliance with these leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. Our ability to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, working capital levels and capital structure, which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors which may be beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future financings will be available on acceptable terms or in amounts sufficient to enable us to service or refinance our indebtedness or to make necessary capital expenditures. In January 2011, we redeemed the remaining $231.3 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 73/4% Notes due 2015 at a redemption price of one thousand dollars for each one thousand dollars of principal amount of notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We recorded a gain to other expense (income), net of approximately $0.9 million in the first quarter of 2011 related to the early extinguishment of our 73/4% Notes due 2015 that were redeemed. This gain consists of original issue premiums, net of deferred financing costs related to our 73/4% Notes due 2015 that were redeemed. On June 2, 2011, we completed the sale of the Digital Business to Autonomy. Pursuant to the Digital Sale Agreement, we received approximately $395.4 million in cash, consisting of the initial purchase price of $380.0 million and a preliminary working capital adjustment of approximately $15.4 million, which remains subject to a customary post closing adjustment based on the amount of working capital at closing. The purchase price for the Digital Sale will be increased on a dollar for dollar basis if the working capital balance at the time of closing exceeds the target amount of working capital as set forth in the Digital Sale Agreement and decreased on a dollar for dollar basis if such closing working capital balance is less than the target amount. We and Autonomy are in disagreement regarding the working capital adjustment in the Digital Sale Agreement. As a result, as contemplated by the Digital Sale Agreement, the matter is being referred to an independent third party accounting firm for determination of the appropriate adjustment. Transaction costs related to the Digital Sale amounted to approximately $7.4 million. Additionally, $11.1 million of inducements are payable to Autonomy and have been netted against the proceeds in calculating the gain on the Digital Sale. We used the net proceeds received from the Digital Sale to pay down amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and used $52.4 million of the net proceeds to fund cash taxes due as a result of the Digital Sale. In September 2011, we completed an underwritten public offering of $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 73/4% Notes due 2019, which were issued at 100% of par. Our net proceeds of $394.0 million after paying the underwriters discounts and commissions, were used for general corporate purposes, including funding a portion of the stockholder payout commitments we have made. 63 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 13 Years 35 Years More than 5 Years Capital Lease Obligations $ 207,300 $ 41,028 $ 64,029 $ 26,578 $ 75,665 Long Term Debt Obligations (excluding Capital Lease Obligations) 3,151,895 32,292 336,343 779,770 2,003,490 Interest Payments(1) 1,547,822 223,402 428,151 369,409 526,860 Operating Lease Obligations(2)(3) 2,698,542 217,634 403,095 365,486 1,712,327 Purchase and Asset Retirement Obligations(4) 68,580 36,352 20,346 1,325 10,557 Total(3)(5) $ 7,674,139 $ 550,708 $ 1,251,964 $ 1,542,568 $ 4,328,899 (1)Amounts include variable rate interest payments, which are calculated utilizing the applicable interest rates as of December 31, 2011; see Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts also include interest on capital leases. (2)Amounts are offset by sublease income of $10.6 million in total (including $2.3 million, $3.6 million, $2.8 million and $1.9 million, in less than 1 year, 13 years, 35 years and more than 5 years, respectively). (3)Includes aggregate amounts related to our Italian Business of $2.6 million, $3.7 million, $3.5 million, $8.2 million ($18.0 million in total) in less than 1 year, 13 years, 35 years and more than 5 years, respectively. (4)In connection with some of our acquisitions, we have potential earn out obligations that may be payable in the event businesses we acquired meet certain financial objectives. These payments are based on the future results of these operations, and our estimate of the maximum contingent earn out payments we may be required to make under all such agreements as of December 31, 2011 is approximately $4.5 million. (5)The table above excludes $31.4 million in uncertain tax positions as we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. We expect to meet our cash flow requirements for the next twelve months from cash generated from operations, existing cash, cash equivalents, borrowings under the New Credit Agreement and other financings, which may include secured credit facilities, securitizations and mortgage or capital lease financings. We expect to meet our long term cash flow requirements using the same means described above, as well as the potential issuance of debt or equity securities as we deem appropriate. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S K Item 303(a)(4)(ii). Net Operating Losses and Foreign Tax Credit Carryforwards We have federal net operating loss carryforwards which begin to expire in 2020 through 2025 of $28.2 million ($9.9 million, tax effected) at December 31, 2011 to reduce future federal taxable income. We have an asset for state net operating losses of $7.9 million (net of federal tax benefit), which begins 64 Table of Contents to expire in 2012 through 2025, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 99%. We have assets for foreign net operating losses of $40.3 million, with various expiration dates, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 69%. We also have foreign tax credits of $56.6 million, which begin to expire in 2014 through 2019, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 65%. U.S. legislative changes in 2010 reduced the expected utilization of foreign tax credits which resulted in the requirement for a valuation allowance. Inflation Certain of our expenses, such as wages and benefits, insurance, occupancy costs and equipment repair and replacement, are subject to normal inflationary pressures. Although to date we have been able to offset inflationary cost increases through increased operating efficiencies and the negotiation of favorable long term real estate leases, we can give no assurance that we will be able to offset any future inflationary cost increases through similar efficiencies, leases or increased storage or service charges.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Market Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to market risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds and time deposits), restricted cash (primarily U.S. Treasuries) and accounts receivable. The only significant concentrations of liquid investments as of December 31, 2011 relate to cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash held on deposit with five global banks and one "Triple A" rated money market fund which we consider to be large, highly rated investment grade institutions. As per our risk management investment policy, we limit exposure to concentration of credit risk by limiting the amount invested in any one mutual fund or financial institution to a maximum of $50.0 million. As of December 31, 2011, our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash balance was $215.0 million, including a money market fund and time deposits amounting to $181.8 million. A substantial portion of the money market fund is invested in U.S. Treasuries. Interest Rate Risk Given the recurring nature of our revenues and the long term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the preference to use long term, fixed interest rate debt to finance our business, thereby helping to preserve our long term returns on invested capital. We target approximately 75% of our debt portfolio to be fixed with respect to interest rates. Occasionally, we will use interest rate swaps as a tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. See Notes 3 and 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2011, we had $586.7 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable interest rate of approximately 2.6%, and $2,766.9 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2011, approximately 82.5% of our total debt outstanding was fixed. If the weighted average variable interest rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%, our net income for the year ended December 31, 2011 would have been reduced by approximately $3.4 million. See Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our long term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of December 31, 2011. Currency Risk Our investments in IME, Canada Company, Iron Mountain Mexico, SA de RL de CV, Iron Mountain South America, Ltd., Iron Mountain Australia Pty Ltd. and our other international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties related to fluctuations in currency valuation. Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. However, our international revenues and expenses are generated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate, primarily the Euro, Canadian dollar 65 Table of Contents and British pound sterling. Declines in the value of the local currencies in which we are paid relative to the U.S. dollar will cause revenues in U.S. dollar terms to decrease and dollar denominated liabilities to increase in local currency. The impact of currency fluctuations on our earnings is mitigated significantly by the fact that most operating and other expenses are also incurred and paid in the local currency. We also have several intercompany obligations between our foreign subsidiaries and IMI and our U.S. based subsidiaries. In addition, Iron Mountain Switzerland GmbH, our foreign subsidiaries and IME also have intercompany obligations between them. These intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary. We have adopted and implemented a number of strategies to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in currency valuations. One strategy is to finance certain of our international subsidiaries with debt that is denominated in local currencies, thereby providing a natural hedge. In determining the amount of any such financing, we take into account local tax strategies, among other factors. Another strategy we utilize is for IMI or IMIM to borrow in foreign currencies to hedge our intercompany financing activities. In addition, on occasion, we enter into currency swaps to temporarily or permanently hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition, to lock in certain transaction economics. We have implemented these strategies for our foreign investments in the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Canada. Specifically, through our 150.0 million British pounds sterling denominated 71/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 and our 255.0 million 63/4% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018, we effectively hedge most of our outstanding intercompany loans denominated in British pounds sterling and Euros. Canada Company has financed its capital needs through direct borrowings in Canadian dollars under the Credit Agreement and its 175.0 million CAD denominated 71/2% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2017. This creates a tax efficient natural currency hedge. In the third quarter of 2007, we designated a portion of our 63/4% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 issued by IMI as a hedge of net investment of certain of our Euro denominated subsidiaries. As a result, we recorded $8.6 million ($5.4 million, net of tax) of foreign exchange gains related to the "marking to market" of such debt to currency translation adjustments which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive items, net included in equity for the year ended December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, net gains of $13.4 million are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive items, net associated with this net investment hedge. We have also entered into a number of separate forward contracts to hedge our exposures to British pounds sterling and Australian dollars. As of December 31, 2011, we had an outstanding forward contract to purchase $195.6 million U.S. dollars and sell 125.0 million British pounds sterling to hedge our intercompany exposures with IME. As of December 31, 2011, we had an outstanding forward contract to purchase $75.1 million U.S. dollars and sell 73.0 million Australian dollars to hedge our intercompany exposures with our Australian subsidiary. At the maturity of the forward contracts, we may enter into new forward contracts to hedge movements in the underlying currencies. At the time of settlement, we either pay or receive the net settlement amount from the forward contract and recognize this amount in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of operations as a realized foreign exchange gain or loss. We have not designated these forward contracts as hedges. At the end of each month, we mark the outstanding forward contracts to market and record an unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss for the mark to market valuation. During the year ended December 31, 2011, there was $1.1 million in net cash disbursements included in cash from operating activities from continuing operations related to settlements associated with these foreign currency forward contracts. We recorded net gains in connection with these forward contracts of $1.2 million (including an unrealized foreign exchange gain of $2.0 million related to certain British pound sterling forward contracts and an unrealized foreign exchange gain of $0.8 million related to the Australian dollar forward contract offset by an unrealized foreign exchange loss of $0.4 million related to a British pound sterling forward contract) in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of 66 Table of Contents operations as of December 31, 2011, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, except as noted above, our currency exposures to intercompany balances are not hedged. The impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and or reduce expenses. Due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange fluctuations on our business. The effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Items, net" component of equity. A 10% depreciation in year end 2011 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction in our equity of approximately $79.8 million.
