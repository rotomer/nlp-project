ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Products. We design, manufacture and market the da Vinci Surgical System, which is an advanced surgical system that we believe represents a new generation of surgery the third generation. The da Vinci Surgical System consists of a surgeons console, a patient side cart, a high performance vision system, proprietary wristed instruments, and various Intuitive accessories. The da Vinci Surgical System seamlessly translates the surgeons natural hand movements on instrument controls at a console into corresponding micro movements of instruments positioned inside the patient through small puncture incisions, or ports. We believe that the da Vinci Surgical System is the only commercially available technology that can provide the surgeon with the intuitive control, range of motion, fine tissue manipulation capability and 3 D visualization characteristic of open surgery, while simultaneously allowing the surgeons to work through the small ports of minimally invasive surgery, or MIS. By placing computer enhanced technology between the surgeon and the patient, we believe that the da Vinci Surgical System enables surgeons to perform better surgery in a manner never before experienced. The da Vinci Surgical System is sold into multiple surgical specialties, principally urologic, cardiothoracic, general, and gynecologic surgeries. Business Model. In our business model, we derive revenue from both the initial capital sales of da Vinci Surgical Systems as well as recurring revenue, comprised of instrument, accessory, service, and training revenue. The da Vinci Surgical System sells for approximately $1 million, or more, depending on configuration, and represents a significant capital equipment investment for our customers. After the initial sale of the da Vinci Surgical System into customer accounts, we generate recurring revenue as our customers use the da Vinci Surgical System to perform surgery and, in the process, buy and consume our EndoWrist instruments and accessory products. We generate additional revenue from recurring system service and customer training. We typically enter into five year service contracts, generally renewable at an annual rate of approximately $0.1 million per year, or more, depending on configuration, with our customers at the time system sales are closed. As our established base of da Vinci Surgical Systems has grown and system utilization has increased, recurring revenue has grown at a faster rate than capital sales. As our business has grown, recurring revenue has comprised an increasing percentage of our overall revenue. Over the past four years, revenue generated from the sale of instruments, accessories, service and training increased from $15.7 million, or 22% of sales, in 2002 to $29.9 million, or 33% of sales in 2003 to $60.0 million, or 43% of sales, in 2004 to $102.7 million, or 45% of sales in 2005. We expect a continuation of this trend in 2006. 2005 Business Events and Trends Introduction. Intuitive Surgical experienced rapid growth during 2005. Our financial success was driven by the continued adoption of the da Vinci Surgical System for use in urologic, cardiothoracic, general, and gynecologic surgeries. Many of the events highlighted below were executed in order to support 2005 business growth and to lay the foundation for future expansion. Financial Highlights. During the year, we met or exceeded most of our internal financial goals: Sales grew 64% to $227.3 million from $138.8 million in 2004. Recurring instrument, accessory, service, and training revenue grew to $102.7 million, up 71% from $60.0 million in 2004. We sold 115 da Vinci Surgical Systems, an increase of 51% compared to 76 in 2004. We ended the year with a da Vinci Surgical System installed base of 394 systems, 296 in North America, 71 in Europe, and 27 in the rest of the world. Gross profit margin improved to 68% from 63% in 2004. Operating expenses were significantly leveraged in 2005 as they grew 27% to $84.8 million while sales grew 64%. 33 Table of Contents Operating income grew 225% to $68.8 million, or 30% of sales, in 2005 from $21.2 million, or 15% of sales in 2004. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments grew by $70.7 million, as we ended the year with $202.7 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments. Prostatectomy Market Share Capture. We grew our market share of radical prostatectomy procedures performed in the United States to approximately 20% at the end of 2005, compared to approximately 10% at the end of 2004, based upon an assumed total United States prostatectomy market of 90,000 procedures performed annually. This continuing penetration contributed significantly to our overall 2005 sales growth. Regulatory Clearances. In March 2005, the FDA granted clearance for the use of the da Vinci Surgical System for use in urologic procedures. This clearance broadened the scope of the radical prostatectomy clearance received during May 2001 to include all urologic surgery. With this clearance, we are now able to actively promote the use of the da Vinci Surgical System for other urologic procedures such as pyeloplasty, nephrectomy, and cystectomy. In April 2005, the FDA granted clearance for use of the da Vinci Surgical System for use in gynecological procedures. With this clearance, we have now begun to actively market the da Vinci Surgical System in gynecology. We believe that the da Vinci Surgical System has the potential to address a significant portion of the sizable hysterectomy market, specifically cases relating to cancer and complex fibroid conditions. Since we have only recently begun to market in this area, it is too early to determine how successful we will be in gaining market share of hysterectomy procedures. In June 2005, the FDA granted clearance for use of the da Vinci Surgical System for use in pediatric procedures. Pediatrics is a relatively small market for us, however we believe that the da Vinci Surgical System will provide value in this area. The following table lists chronologically our FDA clearances to date: July 2000 General laparoscopic procedures March 2001 Non cardiac thoracoscopic procedures May 2001 Prostatectomy procedures November 2002 Cardiotomy procedures July 2004 Cardiac revascularization procedures March 2005 Urologic surgical procedures April 2005 Gynecologic surgical procedures June 2005 Pediatric surgical procedures We believe that we have obtained all of the clearances required to market our products to our targeted surgical specialties within the United States. New Products. In January 2006, we launched the da Vinci S Surgical System. The da Vinci S Surgical System shares the same core technology as the standard da Vinci Surgical System and also features fast setup, rapid instrument exchange, multi quadrant access and multi image display capabilities. The da Vinci S Surgical System is an addition to the da Vinci product line and will be offered at a price approximately $0.2 million above the standard four arm da Vinci Surgical System price. We will continue to sell, service and support the standard da Vinci Surgical System. We will also continue to invest in product development in order to expand the utility and longevity of all da Vinci Surgical Systems, instruments and accessories. We launched several new instrument products during 2005, including the energy based, monopolar shears and the harmonic shears, which we co developed with Ethicon Endosurgery, Inc. As we continue to expand our instrument offering, we provide our customers more surgical options and clinical capability, leading to increased system usage. 34 Table of Contents Facilities and Information Technology Infrastructure. We have made investments in facilities and information technology infrastructure to support current and future growth. During the second quarter of 2005, we completed a 20,000 sq ft expansion of manufacturing and office space within our existing 105,000 square foot Sunnyvale facility. In late December 2005, we invested approximately $20 million to acquire an additional 210,000 square foot facility, located about one mile from our current Sunnyvale site. We will continue to maintain operations in our existing Sunnyvale site. The acquisition of this new property triples our square footage in Sunnyvale and provides us with the necessary capacity to maintain all of our corporate functions, including manufacturing, together in Sunnyvale for several years to come. We are also investing in information technology infrastructure as we have embarked on a project to upgrade our general ledger and manufacturing systems to a new SAP system. We expect to implement this new system around the middle of 2006. Total capital expenditures for 2005, including the purchase of the new facility and transfers of equipment from inventory, were nearly $30 million. Technology Acquisitions. In September 2005, we entered into a cross license agreement with Hansen Medical, Inc. to co exclusively license a number of robotic surgery related patents and applications in the fields of endoscopic, laparascopic thoracoscopic, or open diagnoses and or surgeries. In December 2005, we purchased three patents related to image guided surgery from IBM. In January 2006, we licensed on a non exclusive basis a number of suction stabilizer related patents and applications from Medtronic to make and sell suction stabilizers that are mechanically coupled to and manipulated by robotic devices.

Overall sales growth was driven by the continued adoption of da Vinci surgery, which enables surgeons and medical centers to provide robotic surgical procedures to their patients. We believe that the adoption of robotic surgery will occur surgical procedure by surgical procedure. Our sales growth during the periods presented reflects adoption progress made in our target procedures. Da Vinci prostatectomy (dVP) has been our most successful procedure to date and has been a significant sales catalyst. Assuming a total prostatectomy surgery market of approximately 90,000 in the United States annually, we believe that we ended 2005 capturing approximately 20% of the total U.S. market, compared to 10% ending 2004, and 3% ending 2003. We believe that this market share has been driven by patient demand as patients now routinely search for their best treatment option. An increasing body of clinical evidence has reported dVP to offer superior surgical outcomes compared to traditional open prostatectomy in the critical categories of cancer removal, continence, and sexual potency, combined with the obvious benefits of moving an open procedure to a minimally invasive approach, such as reduced pain, scarring, and blood loss, and a quicker return to normal daily activities. Sales within the United States accounted for 83% of total sales in 2005, 79% in 2004, and 76% in 2003. Domestic sales are growing faster than international sales and account for the large majority of total sales due largely to the competitive maturity of the domestic healthcare market. We believe that at this stage, as we penetrate the early adopters of robotic surgery that sales will continue to concentrate in the U.S. market, as U.S. hospitals are generally more willing to invest in technology that will drive incremental patients into their healthcare systems. We believe that as adoption progresses and we reach standard of care for target procedures, international sales will become a larger percentage of overall sales. The following table summarizes our sales and da Vinci Surgical System unit sales between 2003 and 2005. Sales ($ Millions) 2005 2004 2003 Systems $ 124.6 $ 78.8 $ 61.8 Instruments and accessories 67.8 37.5 18.8 Total product sales 192.4 116.3 80.6 Service and Training 34.9 22.5 11.1 Total sales $ 227.3 $ 138.8 $ 91.7 Recurring sales $ 102.7 $ 60.0 $ 29.9 % of total sales 45 % 43 % 33 % Domestic $ 188.8 $ 109.8 $ 70.1 International 38.5 29.0 21.6 Total sales $ 227.3 $ 138.8 $ 91.7 da Vinci Surgical System unit sales 115 76 61 Product Sales Product sales increased to $192.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $116.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The $76.1 million (65%) increase was due to higher sales of systems, instruments, and accessories. System sales increased to $124.6 million in 2005 from $78.8 million in 2004 reflecting growth in system unit sales of da Vinci Surgical Systems and da Vinci fourth arms. 115 systems were sold in 2005, compared to 76 in 2004. 106 fourth arms were sold in 2005 compared to 65 in 2004. Instrument and accessory sales increased to $67.8 million in 2005 from $37.5 million in 2004. The increase resulted from a larger number of installed systems in 2004 and increased utilization per system in 2005. For established accounts in 2005, we recognized an average of $1,500 to $2,000 in instrument and accessory revenue per surgical procedure performed with the da Vinci Surgical System. Our revenue per surgical procedure has steadily 36 Table of Contents increased over the past two years. Instrument and accessory pricing remains unchanged. We attribute the higher revenue per procedure to having more four arm systems in the installed base and the introduction of new instrument products, especially higher value energy based instruments, such as the bi polar instruments, harmonic shears, and the monopolar shears. Product sales increased to $116.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $80.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The $35.7 million (44%) increase was due to higher sales of systems, instruments, and accessories. System sales increased to $78.8 million in 2004 from $61.8 million in 2003 reflecting growth in system unit sales of da Vinci Surgical Systems and da Vinci fourth arms. 76 systems were sold in 2004, compared to 61 in 2003. 65 fourth arms were sold in 2004 compared to 37 in 2003. The fourth arm product was launched during the second quarter of 2003. Instrument and accessory sales increased to $37.5 million in 2004 from $18.8 million in 2003. The increase resulted from a larger number of installed systems in 2004 and higher utilization per system in 2004. Service Sales Service sales, comprised primarily of system service, installation and customer training, increased to $34.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $22.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. We typically enter into five year service contracts which are generally renewed annually with our customers at the time system sales are completed. Higher 2005 system service revenue was driven by a larger base of da Vinci Surgical Systems producing contract service revenue and higher revenue earned per system under service contract. There were an average of 315 systems under service contract in 2005 generating an average of $108,000 per system per year, compared to an average of 218 systems under service contract in 2004 generating an average of $99,000 per system per year. The increase in service revenue per system was driven by a higher percentage of four arm systems in the 2005 installed base. Four arm systems typically carry a higher contractual service rate than three arm systems. A smaller portion of service sales is comprised of training revenue, which increased to $1.1 million in 2005 from $0.9 million in 2004, reflecting increased training demand resulting primarily from higher da Vinci Surgical System unit sales. Service sales, comprised of system service, installation and customer training, increased to $22.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in this area was driven by a larger base of da Vinci Surgical Systems producing contract service revenue and higher revenue earned per system under service contract. There were an average of 218 systems under service contract in 2004 generating an average of $99,000 per system, compared to an average of 114 systems under service contract in 2003 generating an average of $92,000 per system. The increase in service revenue per system was driven by the introduction of the da Vinci fourth arm during the second quarter of 2003. Four arm systems typically carry a higher contractual service rate than three arm systems. A smaller portion of service sales is comprised of training revenue, which increased to $0.9 million in 2004 from $0.7 million in 2003, reflecting increased training demand resulting primarily from higher da Vinci Surgical System unit sales. Gross Profit Product sales gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $134.1 million, or 70% of product sales, compared to $75.9 million, or 65% of product sales, in 2004. The higher 2005 gross profit was driven by higher 2005 product sales, as described above. Leveraging manufacturing overhead costs across higher product revenue, lower product material costs, and a higher da Vinci Surgical System average selling price drove the higher 2005 product gross margin percentage. We realized an average of $910,000 of revenue per base three arm da Vinci Surgical System in 2005, compared to $867,000 in 2004. Product sales gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $75.9 million, or 65% of product sales, compared to $40.6 million, or 50% of product sales, in 2003. The higher 2004 gross profit was driven by higher 2004 product sales, as described above. The increase in gross profit percentage from 50% in 2003 to 65% in 2004 was driven by leveraging manufacturing overhead across higher revenue, material cost reductions, the impact of 37 Table of Contents Euro denominated sales as the Euro strengthened considerably against the US dollar in 2004, and Computer Motion impairment charges and Brookhill Wilk charges made to cost of sales in 2003. Service sales gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $19.5 million, or 56% of service sales, compared to $12.1 million, or 54% of service sales in 2004 and $3.4 million, or 31% of service sales, in 2003. Increasing gross profit was driven by increasing service sales described above. The year over year improvements to the gross profit profile resulted primarily from leveraging service and training cost pools across a larger base of da Vinci Surgical Systems generating service revenue. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses include personnel costs for sales, marketing and administrative personnel, tradeshow expenses, legal expenses, regulatory fees and general corporate expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2005 were $67.4 million, up 38% from $49.0 million for 2004. The year over year increase was largely due to sales organization headcount growth and commissions paid relating to higher 2005 sales. We also added headcount in various support functions across the organization. Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2004 were $49.0 million, up 23% from $39.7 million for 2003. The year over year increase was largely due to sales organization headcount growth to support higher 2004 sales, higher incentive compensation associated with achieving higher 2004 revenues and profitability, and additional accounting personnel, consulting, and auditing resources required to support Sarbanes Oxley compliance. Selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in the future to support our expanding business. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses include costs associated with the design, development, testing and enhancement of our products. These enhancements represent significant improvements to our products. Research and development expenses also include expenditures for clinical trials and purchases of laboratory supplies. Research and development expenses for 2005 were $17.4 million, compared to $17.8 million for 2004. Research and development expenses for 2004 included $1.1 million of non recurring charges associated with shutting down the former Computer Motion Goleta, California site. Excluding the impact of these non recurring charges, higher 2005 research and development expenses resulted primarily from higher 2005 personnel costs associated with our expanding organization. Research and development expenses for 2004 were $17.8 million, up 10% from $16.2 million for 2003. The increase resulted primarily from the $1.1 million of non recurring charges associated with shutting down the former Computer Motion Goleta, California site, and higher 2004 personnel costs and project materials costs. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development and anticipate that research and development expenses will continue to increase in the future. Interest and Other Income, Net Interest and other income, net comprised mostly of interest income was $5.0 million, $3.0 million and $2.3 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increases between years resulted primarily from higher interest income earned on increasing cash and short term investment balances and generally increasing interest rates throughout the periods presented. 38 Table of Contents Income Tax Benefit (Expense) Our income tax benefit was $20.3 million for 2005, compared to income tax expense of $0.7 million in 2004. There was no income tax expense recorded for the year ended December 31, 2003. Our 2005 income tax included a one time deferred tax benefit of $22.2 million related to the reversal of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2005. Management has concluded, based upon recent operating results, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods available to us, and other factors, that it is more likely than not that we will realize sufficient earnings to utilize our deferred tax assets. Our deferred tax assets arose from federal and state net operating loss carry forwards, federal and state tax credit carry forwards as well as from other timing differences. Historically, these deferred tax assets had been offset in total by a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of our deferred tax assets. The release of the valuation allowance and the resulting recognition of a deferred tax benefit in 2005 was based on managements belief that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized. Our 2004 income tax was $0.7 million. This tax represented taxes due on income not covered by net operating loss carry forwards. In 2003, we recorded a net loss for the year and recorded no income tax expense. We expect that most of the income tax recorded in 2006 will not result in cash outlays during that year due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards as well as deductions due to employee stock options. At December 31, 2005, we had approximately $154.9 million and $66.3 million in federal and state net operating loss carry forwards, respectively, to reduce future taxable income. Of these amounts, $100.5 million and $54.2 million, respectively, relate to stock option deductions that are not included in our deferred tax accounts as we will not recognize these deductions until they are utilized. The federal and state carry forwards have expiration dates beginning in 2012 and 2006, respectively, if not utilized. At December 31, 2005, we had research and development tax credit carry forwards of approximately $5.3 million and $6.6 million for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. Of these amounts, $0.7 million and $1.8 million, respectively, relate to stock option deductions that are not included in our deferred tax accounts as we will not recognize these credits until they are utilized. If not utilized, the federal research and development tax credit carry forwards will begin to expire in 2011. The state research and development tax credit can be carried forward indefinitely. Liquidity And Capital Resources As of December 31, 2005, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $202.7 million, compared to $132.0 million at December 31, 2004 and $112.9 million at December 31, 2003. Working capital at December 31, 2005 was $150.7 million, compared to $138.3 million at December 31, 2004 and $118.3 million at December 31, 2003. The $70.7 million increase in cash, cash equivalents and investments during 2005 resulted primarily from cash provided from operating activities of $70.8 million and proceeds from employee stock purchase and option plans of $33.0 million, partially offset by net fixed asset additions of $30.1 million. The 2004 increase in cash, cash equivalents and short term investments resulted primarily from our net income of $23.5 million, non cash expenses of $7.4 million and proceeds from employee stock purchase and option plans of $13.2 million, partially offset by net fixed asset additions of $22.4 million. The 2003 increase in cash and cash equivalents and investments and working capital resulted primarily from $77.7 million of net proceeds received from our follow on stock offering, offset mostly by the Computer Motion acquisition. Net cash provided by operating activities was $70.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $30.3 million in 2004 and net cash used in operating activities of $7.9 million in 2003. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2005 of $70.8 million resulted primarily from pre tax income of $73.8 million and non cash expenses of $6.8 million, partially offset by $9.8 million of working capital requirements. Net cash 39 Table of Contents provided by operating activities in 2004 of $30.3 million resulted from net income of $23.5 million and non cash expenses of $7.4 million, partially offset by $0.6 million of working capital requirements. Net cash used in operating activities in 2003 resulted from a net loss of $9.6 million and working capital requirements of $9.8 million, partially offset by non cash expenses of $11.5 million. Net cash used in investing activities was $103.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $48.2 million in 2004 and $71.2 million in 2003. Net cash used in investing activities in 2005 resulted primarily from the net movement into investments from cash received from profitable operations and the purchase of the additional three building campus in Sunnyvale, California. Net cash used in investing activities in 2004 resulted primarily from the net movement into short term investments from cash received from profitable operations along with the purchase of the land and building at our headquarters. Net cash used in investing activities in 2003 resulted primarily from the net movement into short term investments from cash received from the follow on offering proceeds. Net cash provided by financing activities was $32.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $12.1 million for 2004 and $82.3 million for 2003. The 2005 net cash provided by financing activities resulted from $33.0 million of employee stock purchases and option and warrant exercise proceeds, offset partially by debt repayment of $0.6 million. The 2004 net cash provided by financing activities resulted from $13.2 million of employee stock purchases and option and warrant exercise proceeds, offset by debt repayment of $1.1 million. The 2003 net cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from our follow on common stock offering yielding $77.7 million of net proceeds, with the remainder coming mostly from employee stock purchases and option exercises. Our capital requirements depend on numerous factors, including market acceptance of our products, the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products and other factors. We expect to devote substantial capital resources to continue our research and development efforts, to expand our customer support and product development activities and for other general corporate activities. During 2005, we experienced significant business expansion. We grew sales 64%, invested in new facilities, began a project to upgrade our information technology systems, and grew our organization by over 30%. In this high growth year, we generated $68.8 million of operating income, which represented the major driver of the net cash provided by operating activities in 2005. Based upon our business model, we anticipate that we will continue to be able to fund future growth through cash provided from operations. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, and short term investment balances, together with income to be derived from the sale of our products, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes all significant contractual payment obligations, net of sublease income of $0.7 million, by payment due date: Payments by Period ($ Millions) Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Operating leases $ 1.1 $ 0.6 $ 0.4 $ 0.1 $ As of early March 2006, the Company had purchase obligations for inventory and other goods and services of approximately $39.8 million. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Note 2, Summary of 40 Table of Contents Significant Accounting Policies in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, describes our significant accounting policies. We believe the following estimates are most critical to an understanding of our financial results and condition and require a higher degree of judgment and complexity: Revenue Recognition. We frequently enter into sales arrangements with customers that contain multiple elements or deliverables such as system, services, training and installation. Judgments as to the allocation of the proceeds received from an arrangement to the multiple elements of the arrangement, the determination of whether any undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are critical in respect to these arrangements to ensure compliance with GAAP. Changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition. Revenue recognition also depends on the timing of shipment and is subject to customer acceptance. If shipments are not made on scheduled timelines or if the products are not accepted by the customer in a timely manner, our reported revenues may differ materially from expectations. Allowance for Sales Returns and Doubtful Accounts. We record estimated reductions in revenue for potential returns of products by customers and other allowances. As a result, management must make estimates of potential future product returns and other allowances related to current period product revenue. In making such estimates, management analyzes historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products. If management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates, material differences in the amount of reported revenue could result. Similarly, management makes estimates of the uncollectability of accounts receivables, especially analyzing accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms, when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Credit evaluations are undertaken for all major sale transactions before shipment is authorized. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate aged items in the accounts receivable aging report and provide allowance in an amount we deem adequate for doubtful accounts. If management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates, material differences in the amount of our reported operating expenses could result. Accounting for stock options. We account for stock based compensation for our employees presented in Accounting Principles Board (APB) No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations, and comply with the disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and with the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. Under APB No. 25, compensation expense is based on the difference, as of the date of the grant, between the fair value of our stock and the exercise price. No stock based compensation has been recorded for stock options granted to our employees because we have granted stock options to our employees equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. We have recorded stock based compensation, primarily related to deferred compensation arising from our initial public offering in 2000 and our acquisition of Computer Motion, Inc. in June 2003. On December 15, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123R, Shared Based Payment which requires public companies to value employee stock options and stock issued under employee stock purchase plans using fair value based methods on the option grant date and record them as stock based compensation expense. Fair value based models, such as the Black Scholes option pricing model, requires the input of highly subjective assumptions. Assumptions used under the Black Scholes option pricing model that are highly subjective include the expected stock price volatility and expected life of an option. On March 29, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107) to provide further guidance on the valuation models, expected volatility, and expected option 41 Table of Contents term. We currently use the Black Scholes option pricing model to calculate the pro forma effect on net income and net income per share if we had applied SFAS No. 123 to employee option grants.
