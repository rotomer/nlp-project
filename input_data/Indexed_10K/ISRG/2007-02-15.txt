ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Products. We design, manufacture and market da Vinci Surgical Systems, which are advanced surgical systems that we believe represent a new generation of surgery the third generation. The da Vinci Surgical System consists of a surgeons console, a patient side cart and a high performance vision system. The product line also includes proprietary wristed instruments and surgical accessories. The da Vinci Surgical System seamlessly translates the surgeons natural hand movements on instrument controls at a console into corresponding micro movements of instruments positioned inside the patient through small puncture incisions, or ports. We believe that the da Vinci Surgical System is the only commercially available technology that can provide the surgeon with intuitive control, range of motion, fine tissue manipulation capability and 3 D HD visualization, while simultaneously allowing the surgeons to work through the small ports of minimally invasive surgery, or MIS. By placing computer enhanced technology between the surgeon and the patient, we believe that the da Vinci Surgical System enables surgeons to improve clinical outcomes while reducing the invasiveness of complex surgical procedures. The da Vinci Surgical System is sold into multiple surgical specialties, principally urology, gynecology, cardiothoracic, and general surgery. 33 Table of Contents Business Model. In our business model, we generate revenue from both the initial capital sales of da Vinci Surgical Systems as well as recurring revenue, comprised of instrument, accessory, service, and training revenue. The da Vinci Surgical System sells for approximately $1.0 million to $1.7 million, depending on configuration, and represents a significant capital equipment investment for our customers. We then generate recurring revenue as our customers purchase our EndoWrist instruments and accessory products for use in performing procedures with the da Vinci Surgical System. EndoWrist instruments and accessories will either expire or wear out as they are used in surgery and will need to be replaced as they are consumed. We generate additional recurring revenue from ongoing system service and customer training. We typically enter into service contracts at the time the system is sold. These service contracts have been generally renewable at the end of the service period, generally at an annual rate of approximately $100,000 to $150,000 per year, depending on configuration of the underlying system. Since the introduction of the da Vinci Surgical System in 1999, our established base of da Vinci Surgical Systems has grown and robotic surgery volume has increased. Recurring revenue has grown at an equal or faster rate than capital revenue. Over the past five years, revenue generated from the sale of instruments and accessories, service and training increased from $15.7 million, or 22% of revenue, in fiscal 2002 to $29.9 million, or 33% of revenue, in fiscal 2003 to $60.0 million, or 43% of revenue, in fiscal 2004 to $102.7 million, or 45% of revenue, in fiscal 2005 to $166.8 million, or 45% of revenue, in fiscal 2006. We expect recurring revenue to become a larger percentage of total revenue in the future. 2006 Business Events and Trends Introduction. We experienced rapid growth during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 , which was driven by the continued adoption of the da Vinci Surgical System for use in urologic, gynecologic, cardiothoracic, and general surgeries. Financial Highlights. Revenue grew 64% to $372.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 from $227.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2005. Recurring instrument, accessory, service, and training revenue grew to $166.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, up 62% from $102.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2005. We sold 170 da Vinci Surgical Systems during the year ended December 31, 2006; an increase of 48% compared to 115 during the year ended December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2006, we had a da Vinci Surgical System installed base of 559 systems, 429 in North America, 92 in Europe, and 38 in the rest of the world. Operating income increased by 56% to $107.4 million, or 29% of revenue, during the year ended December 31, 2006 from $68.8 million, or 30% of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2005. During the first quarter of 2006, in accordance with SFAS 123(R), we began to record stock compensation expense for the estimated value of employee stock options and stock purchases. Stock compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $25.3 million. Stock compensation expenses are entirely non cash in nature. No stock compensation expense was included in the 2005 consolidated results of operations. Our business continues to demonstrate the ability to generate significant positive cash flow while supporting our rapid business growth. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments increased by $127.6 million from fiscal 2005, as we ended fiscal 2006 with $330.3 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments. 34 Table of Contents Procedure adoption We believe the adoption of da Vinci surgery occurs surgical procedure by surgical procedure, and it is being adopted for those procedures which offer significant patient value. The value of a surgical procedure to a patient is higher if it offers superior clinical outcomes, less surgical trauma, or both. The procedures that have driven the most growth in our business recently are the da Vinci Prostatectomy and the da Vinci Hysterectomy. In 2006, da Vinci Prostatectomy procedures, which represented more than half of all the da Vinci surgical procedures for the year, grew over 75% from 2005, and it is expected to grow at least 50% from 2006 to 2007. The da Vinci Hysterectomy procedure was our fastest growing procedure from a percentage growth standpoint in 2006, and it is expected to grow at least 150% from 2006 to 2007. Regulatory Clearances. We believe that we have obtained all of the clearances required to market our products to our targeted surgical specialties within the United States. The following table lists chronologically our FDA clearances to date: July 2000 General laparoscopic procedures March 2001 Non cardiac thoracoscopic procedures May 2001 Prostatectomy procedures November 2002 Cardiotomy procedures July 2004 Cardiac revascularization procedures March 2005 Urologic surgical procedures April 2005 Gynecologic surgical procedures June 2005 Pediatric surgical procedures New Products. In January 2006, we launched the da Vinci S Surgical System. The da Vinci S Surgical System shares the same core technology as the standard da Vinci Surgical System and also features fast setup, rapid instrument exchange, multi quadrant access and multi image display capabilities. The da Vinci S Surgical System is an addition to the da Vinci product line and is offered at a price approximately $0.2 million above the standard da Vinci Surgical System price. Market response to the da Vinci S Surgical System has proven to be positive, as 148 of the 170 total systems sold during 2006 were da Vinci S Surgical Systems. Many of our existing customers who invested in the standard da Vinci Surgical System identified the benefits of the robotic surgery and expanded their robotic programs with the da Vinci S Surgical System. We will continue to sell, service and support the standard da Vinci Surgical System. We will also continue to invest in product development in order to expand the utility and longevity of all da Vinci Surgical Systems, instruments and accessories. In January 2007, we launched the high definition, 3 D (3 D HD) vision system. The 3 D HD vision system provides 20% more viewing area and enhances visualization of tissue planes and critical anatomy. The digital zoom feature in the 3 D HD vision system allows surgeons to magnify the surgical field of view without adjusting endoscope position and reduces interference between the endoscope and instruments. We believe the new 3 D HD vision system will enable improved surgical outcomes. The 3 D HD vision will be available as an option on new da Vinci S Surgical Systems and as an upgrade option to our existing customers who own a da Vinci S Surgical System. We launched several new instruments during the year ended December 31, 2006, including the tenaculuum, atrial retractor, Endo PK Dissector, the Mega Needle driver, and the 5mm instrument set for the da Vinci S Surgical System. 35 Table of Contents The tenaculum is primarily targeted for gynecological use and is a device used to manipulate and control the uterus, during a hysterectomy, or to control a fibroid during a myomectomy. The atrial retractor is a cardiac tool designed to provide easier access during valve repair procedures. We developed the Endo PK Dissector in cooperation with Gyrus ACMI, an industry leader in both tissue management technology and endoscopies. The Endo PK Dissector is a fully articulating coagulator and dissector, which is patterned after Gyrus successful Lyons Dissector. The Endo PK Dissector addresses several needs for da Vinci Surgical System users. As a dissector, it allows for highly precise dissection, delivers excellent coagulation performance as well as providing grasping capabilities. We expect this instrument to be used within urology, gynecology, and general surgery. We designed the da Vinci Mega Needle driver specifically to handle larger needles, which are often required in gynecological surgery, such as the da Vinci Hysterectomy, as well as in general surgery. As we continue to expand our instrument offering, we will provide our customers more surgical options and clinical capability, which we anticipate will lead to increased system usage. Facilities and Information Technology Infrastructure. We have made investments in facilities and information technology infrastructure to support current and future growth. In late December 2005, we invested approximately $20 million to acquire an additional 210,000 square foot facility, located about one mile from our first Sunnyvale, CA site, where we continue to maintain operations. The acquisition of this new property tripled our square footage in Sunnyvale and provided us with the necessary capacity to maintain all of our corporate functions, including manufacturing, together in Sunnyvale, for several years to come. In 2006, we opened a new customer training facility and service support center at this location. We have invested in information technology infrastructure to upgrade our general ledger and manufacturing systems to a new SAP system. The implementation of this new system was completed in May 2006. Total capital expenditures for 2006 were $15.9 million. Technology Acquisitions. In January 2006, we licensed, on a non exclusive basis, a number of suction cardiac stabilizer related patents and applications from Medtronic to make and sell suction stabilizers that are mechanically coupled to and manipulated by robotic devices. In March 2006, we licensed, on a non exclusive basis, patents to force reflecting haptic devices and associated software from Sensable Technology to use in the robotic surgical systems. In June 2006, we licensed, on a non exclusive basis, PK electrosurgical instruments and eletrosurgical generator related patent and application from Gyrus Group PLC to make and sell PK instruments and Gyrus electrosurgical generators with robotic systems in the field of surgeries. International Reorganization. In January 2007, we announced plans to restructure our international operations. We plan to shut down our international headquarters located in France and re establish our international headquarters in Switzerland. We believe this restructuring will streamline our international operations and optimize our tax structure for the long term. We do not anticipate realizing benefits from the lower tax rates until fiscal 2008 at the earliest. The current restructuring plan will result in costs for relocation of the European operations and certain employees, severance of certain employees, the set up of new facilities and information technology infrastructure, and other costs associated with the transition. Based upon the plan, we expect to incur costs of approximately $2.0 million through the second quarter of fiscal 2007. 36 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the years indicated, certain consolidated statements of operations information (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2006 % of totalrevenue 2005 % of totalrevenue 2004 % of totalrevenue Revenue: Products $ 317,599 85 % $ 192,417 85 % $ 116,338 84 % Services 55,083 15 % 34,921 15 % 22,465 16 % Total revenue 372,682 100 % 227,338 100 % 138,803 100 % Cost of revenue: Products 97,615 26 % 58,357 26 % 40,472 29 % Services 27,231 7 % 15,412 6 % 10,341 8 % Total cost of revenue 124,846 33 % 73,769 32 % 50,813 37 % Products gross profit 219,984 59 % 134,060 59 % 75,866 55 % Services gross profit 27,852 8 % 19,509 9 % 12,124 8 % Gross profit 247,836 67 % 153,569 68 % 87,990 63 % Operating costs and expenses: Selling, general and administrative 110,703 30 % 67,443 30 % 48,994 35 % Research and development 29,778 8 % 17,354 8 % 17,812 13 % Total operating costs and expenses 140,481 38 % 84,797 38 % 66,806 48 % Income from operations 107,355 29 % 68,772 30 % 21,184 15 % Interest and other income, net 12,783 3 % 5,035 2 % 3,020 2 % Income before income taxes 120,138 32 % 73,807 32 % 24,204 17 % Income tax expense (benefit) 48,094 13 % (20,327 ) 9 % 726 0 % Net income $ 72,044 19 % $ 94,134 41 % $ 23,478 17 % Total Revenue Total revenue increased by 64% during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. Revenue increased from $138.8 million during year ended December 31, 2004 to $227.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 to $372.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. Total revenue growth was driven by the continued adoption of da Vinci surgery. We believe that the adoption of robotic surgery will occur surgical procedure by surgical procedure. Our revenue growth during the periods presented reflects adoption progress made in our target procedures. Da Vinci Prostatectomy (dVP) has been our most successful procedure to date. An increasing body of clinical evidence has indicated dVP to offer superior surgical outcomes compared to traditional open prostatectomy in the critical categories of cancer removal, continence, and sexual potency. In 2006, da Vinci Hysterectomy (dVH) emerged as our fastest growing procedure on a percentage of growth basis. Favorable clinical results have been reported in hysterectomies for cancerous pathology, which include increased lymph node retrieval counts and significant reduction in blood transfusion. For most patients, a minimally invasive approach using the da Vinci Surgical System offers reduced pain, less blood loss, shorter hospital stays and a quicker return to normal daily activities. Revenue within the United States accounted for 83% of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, and 79% during the year ended December 31, 2004. We believe domestic revenue accounts for the large majority of total revenue due largely to the competitive nature of the domestic healthcare market. We 37 Table of Contents also believe that at this stage, as we penetrate the early adopters of robotic surgery, revenue will continue to concentrate in the U.S. market, as U.S. hospitals are generally more willing to invest in technology that will drive incremental patients into their healthcare systems. We expect that as adoption progresses and as we reach standard of care for target procedures, international revenue will increase as a percentage of overall revenue. The following table summarizes our revenue and da Vinci Surgical System unit sales for the past three years (in millions, except unit sales): Revenue 2006 2005 2004 Instruments and accessories $ 111.7 $ 67.8 $ 37.5 Systems 205.9 124.6 78.8 Total product revenue 317.6 192.4 116.3 Service and training 55.1 34.9 22.5 Total revenue $ 372.7 $ 227.3 $ 138.8 Recurring revenue $ 166.8 $ 102.7 $ 60.0 % of total revenue 45 % 45 % 43 % Domestic $ 309.9 $ 188.8 $ 109.8 International 62.8 38.5 29.0 Total revenue $ 372.7 $ 227.3 $ 138.8 da Vinci Surgical System unit sales 170 115 76 Product Revenue Product revenue increased to $317.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $192.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The $125.2 million (65%) increase reflects higher revenue of systems, instruments, and accessories. Product revenue increased to $192.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $116.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The $76.1 million (65%) increase was due to higher revenue of systems, instruments, and accessories. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $111.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 from $67.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase is driven by higher adoption rates of robotic surgery. For established accounts in 2006, we recognized an average of $1,500 to $2,000 in instrument and accessory revenue per surgical procedure performed with the da Vinci Surgical System. Total instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was between $2,000 and $2,500 reflecting the impact of initial instrument and accessory purchases for newly installed systems. Instrument and accessory pricing remains unchanged from 2005. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $67.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 from $37.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was driven by higher adoption rates of robotic surgery. System revenue increased to $205.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 from $124.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 due to growth in the number of systems sold reflecting adoption of robotic surgery and increased average selling prices (ASPs) resulting from the successful launch of the higher priced da Vinci S Surgical System. 170 systems were sold during the year ended December 31, 2006, including 4 systems that involved a trade in, netting to 166 systems added to the installed base, compared to 115 systems during the year ended December 31, 2005. The 170 systems sold during 2006 consisted of 148 da Vinci S Surgical Systems and 22 standard da Vinci Surgical Systems. The average revenue recognized per da Vinci system sold increased to $1.18 million in 2006, compared to $1.05 million in 2005 primarily due to the higher price of da Vinci S Systems. System revenue increased to $124.6 million during year ended December 31, 2005 from $78.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2004, reflecting growth in system unit revenue of 38 Table of Contents da Vinci Surgical Systems and da Vinci fourth arms. 115 systems were sold during the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to 76 during the year ended December 31, 2004. 106 fourth arms were sold during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 65 during the year ended December 31, 2004. Service and Training Revenue Service and training revenue, comprised primarily of system service and customer training, increased to $55.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $34.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. We typically enter into service contracts at the time the system is sold. These service contracts have been generally renewed at the end of the service period. Higher 2006 system service revenue was driven by a larger base of da Vinci Surgical Systems producing contract service revenue and higher revenue earned per system under service contract. There were an average of 451 systems under service contract in 2006 generating an average of $118,000 per system per year, compared to an average of 315 systems under service contract in 2005 generating an average of $108,000 per system per year. The increase in service revenue per system was driven by a higher percentage of da Vinci and da Vinci S Surgical Systems in the 2006 installed base, which typically carry a higher contractual service rate than three arm systems. Service revenue comprised of system service and customer training, increased to $34.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $22.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in this area was driven by a larger base of da Vinci Surgical Systems producing contract service revenue and higher revenue earned per system under service contract. There were an average of 315 systems under service contract in 2005 generating an average of $108,000 per system, compared to an average of 218 systems under service contract in 2004 generating an average of $99,000 per system. The increase in service revenue per system was driven by the higher percentage of fourth arm da Vinci Systems, which typically carry a higher contractual service rate than three arm systems. Gross Profit Products gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $220.0 million, or 69% of product revenue, compared to $134.1 million, or 70% of product revenue, during the year ended December 31, 2005. The higher 2006 gross profit was driven by higher 2006 product revenue, as described above. Lower 2006 product profit margins were primarily due to $2.4 million impact of stock option expense that was not included in 2005 results. Products gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $134.1 million, or 70% of product revenue, compared to $75.9 million, or 65% of product revenue, during the year ended December 31, 2004. The higher 2005 gross profit was driven by higher 2005 product revenue, as described above. Leveraging manufacturing overhead costs across higher product revenue, lower product material costs, and a higher da Vinci Surgical System average selling price drove the higher 2005 product gross margin. We realized an average of $910,000 of revenue per three arm da Vinci Surgical System during the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $867,000 during the year ended December 31, 2004. Service gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $27.9 million, or 51% of service revenue, compared to $19.5 million, or 56% of service revenue during the year ended December 31, 2005. Higher 2006 gross profit was driven by increasing service revenue, as described above. The decline in service gross margin was primarily due to costs incurred to support the da Vinci S Surgical System product line and the $1.5 million impact of stock option expenses included in the 2006 results that was not included in 2005 results. Service gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $19.5 million, or 56% of service revenue, compared to $12.1 million, or 54% of service revenue, during the year ended December 31, 2004. Increasing gross profit was driven by increasing service revenue, as described above. The increase in service gross margin was primarily from leveraging service and training cost pools across a larger base of da Vinci Surgical Systems generating service revenue. 39 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses include personnel costs for sales, marketing and administrative personnel, tradeshow expenses, legal expenses, regulatory fees and general corporate expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2006 were $110.7 million, up 64% from $67.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2005. The year over year increase was primarily due to stock compensation expense charged to general and administrative expenses of $16.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, sales organization growth, and higher commissions relating to higher revenue. We also added headcount in various support functions across the organization. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in the future to support our expanding business. Selling, general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2005 were $67.4 million, up 38% from $49.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2004. The year over year increase was largely due to sales organization headcount growth to support higher 2005 revenue, higher incentive compensation associated with achieving higher 2005 revenues and profitability, and additional headcount in other support functions across the organization. Research and Development Expenses Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses include costs associated with the design, development, testing and enhancement of our products. These enhancements represent significant improvements to our products. Research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2006 were $29.8 million, compared to $17.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was due to the impact of stock compensation expense charged to research and development of $5.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, growth in our research and development organization, higher prototype expenses, and other project costs. We expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development and anticipate that research and development expenses will continue to increase in the future. Research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2005 were $17.4 million, compared to $17.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2004. Research and development expenses for fiscal 2004 included $1.1 million of charges associated with shutting down the former Computer Motion Goleta, California site. Excluding the impact of these non recurring charges, higher 2005 research and development expenses resulted primarily from higher 2005 personnel costs associated with our expanding organization. Interest and Other Income, Net Interest and other income, net, comprised mostly of interest income, was $12.8 million, $5.0 million, and $3.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Interest income was $11.4 million, $5.6 million, and $2.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The increases between years resulted primarily from higher interest income earned on increasing cash, cash equivalent and investment balances and generally increasing interest rates throughout the periods presented. Income Tax Expense (Benefit) Our income tax expense (benefit) was $48.1 million, ($20.3) million, and $0.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2006 is approximately 40.0%, which differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to state income taxes net of federal benefit. Most of the income taxes recorded in fiscal 2006 did not result in cash outlays during the year due to the 40 Table of Contents utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards as well as deductions due to employee stock options. Our 2005 income tax included a one time deferred tax benefit of $22.2 million related to the reversal of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter. Management concluded, based upon operating results, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods available to us, and other factors, that it was more likely than not that we would realize sufficient earnings to utilize our deferred tax assets. The recognition of these deferred tax assets had no impact on our cash flows. The effective tax rate for 2005 was approximately (27.5%) and diverged from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily as a result of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards, tax credits and the reversal of valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, partially offset by state income taxes net of federal tax benefit. The effective tax rate for 2004 was approximately 3.0%, which generally represented federal alternative minimum taxes as well as state and foreign taxes. We had a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets in 2004. At December 31, 2006, we had approximately $62.2 million and $12.4 million in federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, respectively, to reduce future taxable income. Of these amounts, $42.8 million and $7.5 million, respectively, relate to stock option deductions that are not included in our deferred tax assets as we will not recognize these deductions until they are utilized and will be recorded as stockholders equity and as a reduction of goodwill. The federal and state carryforwards have expiration dates beginning in 2019 and 2012, respectively, if not utilized. At December 31, 2006, we had research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $5.1 million and $5.2 million for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. Of these amounts, $5.1 million and $3.3 million, respectively, relate to stock option deductions that are not included in our deferred tax assets as we will not recognize these credits until they are utilized. If not utilized, the federal research and development tax credit carry forwards will begin to expire in 2011. The state research and development tax credit can be carried forward indefinitely. Liquidity And Capital Resources Sources and Uses of Cash Our principal source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and the exercise of stock options. Cash and cash equivalents plus short and long term investments increased from $132.0 million at December 31, 2004, to $202.7 million at December 31, 2005, to $330.3 million at December 31, 2006. Cash generation is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting our operating, investing and financing needs. Consolidated Cash Flow Data Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in thousands) Net cash provided by (used in) Operating activities $ 99,845 $ 70,787 $ 30,315 Investing activities (113,353 ) (103,307 ) (48,153 ) Financing activities 42,183 32,316 12,117 Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents 207 (59 ) 157 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 28,882 $ (263 ) $ (5,564 ) 41 Table of Contents Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2006, cash flow from operations of $99.8 million exceeded our net income of $72.0 million for two primary reasons: 1) Our net income included substantial non cash charges in the form of stock compensation, taxes, and depreciation and amortization of long lived assets. These non cash charges totaled $56.0 million. 2) We experienced rapid growth in our business with revenues increasing 64% in 2006. This growth requires investment in working capital, particularly accounts receivable and inventory. Our net investment in working capital and other operating assets totaled $28.2 million. Working capital is comprised primarily of accounts receivable, inventory, deferred revenue and other current liabilities. Accounts receivable increased $41.9 million or 79% in 2006 reflecting increased revenue and the timing of system sales. Inventory increased $9.0 million or 60% in 2006, slightly less than increased volume. Deferred revenue, which includes deferred service contract revenue that is being amortized over the service contract period, increased $11.9 million or 47% in 2006, which is primarily related to the increase in the number of installed systems for which service contracts exist. Other current liabilities including accounts payable, accrued compensation and employee benefits, and accrued liabilities increased $11.0 million or 33% in 2006. Other accrued liabilities fluctuate with changes in the volume of our business and the timing of vendor payments. For the year ended December 31, 2005, cash flow from operations of $70.8 million was less than our net income of $94.1 million for two primary reasons: 1) we recorded a one time deferred tax benefit of $22.2 million (see Note 8 of the Notes to the Financial Statements). This benefit was non cash. 2) we experienced rapid growth in our business with revenues increasing 64% in 2005. This growth requires investment in working capital, particularly accounts receivable and inventory. Our net investment in working capital and other operating assets totaled $9.7 million. For the year ended December 31, 2004, cash flow from operations of $30.3 million was greater than our net income of $23.5 million primarily due to non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of long lived assets. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 consisted primarily of purchases in investments (net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments) of $95.3 million, $72.3 million and $25.7 million, respectively, and purchases of property and equipment and licensing of patents of $18.1 million, $31.0 million and $22.4 million, respectively. Our investments are in U.S. government notes and bonds, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and auction rate securities, and generated approximately 4.3% interest in 2006. We are not a capital intensive business. Our purchases of property and equipment in 2006 related mainly to facilities and information technology infrastructure to support capacity expansion in our business. The purchases of property and equipment in 2005 and 2004 related mainly to the purchase of our facilities in Sunnyvale. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities in 2006 consisted primarily of proceeds from stock options and warrants exercises of $19.1 million and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation of $23.0 million. Net cash flows provided by financing activities in 2005 and 2004 consisted primarily of proceeds from stock options and warrants exercises of $32.9 million and $13.2 million, respectively. 42 Table of Contents Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents The positive effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents in 2006 and 2004 was due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar during those periods against other foreign currencies, primarily the Euro. The negative effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents in 2005 was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar during that period against other foreign currencies, primarily the Euro. Our capital requirements depend on numerous factors, including market acceptance of our products, the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products and other factors. We expect to devote substantial capital resources to continue our research and development efforts, to expand our customer support and product development activities and for other general corporate activities. During 2006, we experienced significant business expansion. We increased revenue by 64%, invested in new facilities, upgraded our information technology systems, and increased our headcount by 34%. In this high growth year, we generated $72.0 million of net income, which represented the major driver of the net cash provided by operating activities in 2006. Based upon our business model, we anticipate that we will continue to be able to fund future growth through cash provided from operations. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and investments balances, together with income to be derived from the sale of our products, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately $2.0 million of operating lease commitments, net of sublease income, half of which is due within one year and the other half due by December 2009. We also have purchase obligations of approximately $55.0 million, representing an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, including commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services. A majority of these purchase obligations are due within a year. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2006, we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K 40. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, which requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions. Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, describes our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of consolidated financial statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies. Revenue recognition. We frequently enter into revenue arrangements with customers that contain multiple elements or deliverables such as system, services, and training. Judgments as to the allocation of the proceeds received from an arrangement to the multiple elements of the arrangement, the determination of whether any undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are critical in respect to these arrangements to ensure compliance with GAAP. Changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition. Revenue recognition also depends on the timing of 43 Table of Contents shipment and is subject to customer acceptance. If shipments are not made on scheduled timelines or if the products are not accepted by the customer in a timely manner, our reported revenues may differ materially from expectations. Allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts. We record estimated reductions in revenue for potential returns of products by customers and other allowances. As a result, management must make estimates of potential future product returns and other allowances related to current period product revenue. In making such estimates, management analyzes historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products. If management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates, material differences in the amount of reported revenue could result. Similarly, management makes estimates of the uncollectibility of accounts receivables, especially analyzing accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms, when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Credit evaluations are undertaken for all major sale transactions before shipment is authorized. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate aged items in the accounts receivable aging report and provide allowance in an amount we deem adequate for doubtful accounts. If management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates, material differences in the amount of our reported operating expenses could result. Inventory valuation. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first in, first out basis. The carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand. We evaluate the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Accounting for stock options. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R). We use the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions. These assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them, the estimated volatility of the our common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements. Changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and, consequently, the related amount recognized on the consolidated statements of operations. Impairment of long lived assets. We evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets in accordance with SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets . When events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable, we recognize such impairment in the event the net book value of such assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets. We have intangible assets on our balance sheet related to the acquisition of Computer Motion, Inc. and the acquisition of other patents. The valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful amortization lives involves judgments and the use of estimates. The evaluation of these intangibles for impairment under established accounting guidelines is required on a recurring basis. Changes in business conditions could potentially require future adjustments to asset valuations. We conducted the required intangible assets impairment review during the fourth quarter of 2006. No impairment charge was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. A considerable amount of judgment is required in calculating this impairment charge, principally in determining market premiums and financial forecasts. Should conditions be different from managements current estimates, material write downs of long lived assets may be required, which would adversely affect our operating results. 44 Table of Contents Goodwill. We have goodwill on our balance sheet relating to the acquisition of Computer Motion, Inc. Goodwill is recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. We perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and more frequently if certain indicators are present. In the event we determine that goodwill has been impaired, we will record an accounting charge for the impairment during the fiscal quarter in which the determination is made. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we performed our assessment of whether there was an indication that goodwill was impaired at December 31, 2006. The quoted market price of our common stock was used to determine fair value for the impairment purpose. Our market capitalization continues to support the fair value of our reporting unit. We completed the goodwill impairment tests and determined that the goodwill was not impaired at December 31, 2006. A considerable amount of judgment is required in calculating this impairment charge, principally in determining the reporting units. Should conditions be different from managements current estimates, material write downs of goodwill may be required, which would adversely affect our operating results. Accounting for income taxes. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Beginning fourth quarter of 2005, we released our valuation allowance as we believed that it was more likely than not that we would be able to utilize our deferred tax assets. Management had concluded, based upon operating results, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods available to us, and other factors, that it is more likely than not that we will realize sufficient earnings to utilize our deferred tax assets. As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences that may result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Managements judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets. Any such valuation allowance would be based on management estimates of taxable income and the period over which our deferred tax assets would be recoverable.
