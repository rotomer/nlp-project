ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Products. We design, manufacture and market da Vinci Surgical Systems, which are advanced surgical systems that we believe represent a new generation of surgery. The da Vinci Surgical System consists of a surgeons console, a patient side cart and a high performance vision system. The product line also includes proprietary wristed instruments and surgical accessories. The da Vinci Surgical System seamlessly translates the surgeons natural hand movements on instrument controls at a console into corresponding micro movements of instruments positioned inside the patient through small puncture incisions, or ports. We believe that the da Vinci Surgical System is the only commercially available technology that can provide the surgeon with intuitive control, range of motion, fine tissue manipulation capability and 3 D HD visualization, while simultaneously allowing the surgeons to work through the small ports of minimally invasive surgery, or MIS. By placing computer enhanced technology between the surgeon and the patient, we believe that the da Vinci Surgical System enables surgeons to improve clinical outcomes while reducing the invasiveness of complex surgical 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements procedures. The da Vinci Surgical System is sold into multiple surgical specialties, principally urology, gynecology, cardiothoracic, and general surgery. Business Model. In our business model, we generate revenue from both the initial capital sales of da Vinci Surgical Systems as well as recurring revenue, comprised of instrument, accessory, and service revenue. The da Vinci Surgical System generally sells for approximately $1.0 million to $1.7 million, depending on configuration, and represents a significant capital equipment investment for our customers. We then generate recurring revenue as our customers purchase our EndoWrist instruments and accessory products for use in performing procedures with the da Vinci Surgical System. EndoWrist instruments and accessories will either expire or wear out as they are used in surgery and will need to be replaced as they are consumed. We generate additional recurring revenue from ongoing system service. We typically enter into service contracts at the time the system is sold. These service contracts have been generally renewable at the end of the service period, typically at an annual rate of approximately $100,000 to $150,000 per year, depending on configuration of the underlying system. Since the introduction of the da Vinci Surgical System in 1999, our established base of da Vinci Surgical Systems has grown and robotic surgery volume has increased. Recurring revenue has grown at an equal or faster rate than system revenue. Over the past five years, revenue generated from the sales of instruments and accessories, service and training increased from $29.9 million, or 33% of total revenue, in 2003 to $60.0 million, or 43% of total revenue, in 2004 to $102.7 million, or 45% of total revenue, in 2005 to $166.8 million, or 45% of total revenue, in 2006 to $276.4 million, or 46% of total revenue, in 2007. We expect recurring revenue to become a larger percentage of total revenue in the future. Regulatory Activities We believe that we have obtained all of the clearances required to market our products to our targeted surgical specialties within the United States. As we make additions to target procedures, we will continue to obtain the necessary clearance. The following table lists chronologically our FDA clearances to date: July 2000 General laparoscopic procedures March 2001 Non cardiac thoracoscopic procedures May 2001 Prostatectomy procedures November 2002 Cardiotomy procedures July 2004 Cardiac revascularization procedures March 2005 Urologic surgical procedures April 2005 Gynecologic surgical procedures June 2005 Pediatric surgical procedures In an October 2007 Enforcement report from FDA, the FDA reported on two corrections and removals conducted by us for our systems. We have addressed these issues through field inspections and corrections using our field service organization. As part of our quality system, we take a pro active approach in upgrading software in our field systems routinely and in monitoring system performance. These actions are reviewed by FDA and are periodically reported if they meet certain criteria for public reporting. We believe our quality systems are functioning properly and we continue to work with FDA and agencies worldwide to satisfy their reporting requirements. 2007 Business Events and Trends Introduction. We experienced rapid growth during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, which was driven by the continued adoption of the da Vinci Surgical System for use in urologic, gynecologic, cardiothoracic, and general surgeries. 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 2007 Financial Highlights Revenue grew 61% to $600.8 million compared with $372.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Recurring revenue grew 66% to $276.4 million compared with $166.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Instruments and accessories revenue grew 72% to $191.7 million compared with $111.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. System revenue grew 58% to $324.4 million compared with $205.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. We sold 241 da Vinci Surgical Systems during the year ended December 31, 2007; an increase of 42% compared with 170 for the year ended December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2007, we had a da Vinci Surgical System installed base of 795 systems, 595 in North America, 136 in Europe, and 64 in the rest of the world. Operating income increased by 93% to $206.7 million, or 34% of revenue, during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $107.4 million, or 29% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating income included $36.3 million and $25.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, of stock based compensation expense for the estimated fair value of employee stock options and stock purchases. Our business continues to demonstrate the ability to generate significant positive cash flow while supporting our rapid business growth. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments increased by $305.1 million during 2007, including $56.0 million of proceeds from employee stock programs and warrant exercises. We ended fiscal 2007 with $635.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments. Procedure adoption We believe the adoption of da Vinci surgery occurs surgical procedure by surgical procedure, and it is being adopted for those procedures which offer significant patient value. The value of a surgical procedure to a patient is higher if it offers superior clinical outcomes, less surgical trauma, or both. The procedures that have driven the most growth in our business recently are the da Vinci Prostatectomy (dVP) and the da Vinci Hysterectomy (dVH). dVP procedures grew by over 65% in 2007 and represented more than half of all the da Vinci surgical procedures for the year. The dVH procedure was a faster growing procedure from a percentage growth standpoint in 2007, growing by over 175%. New Products. We launched the high definition (HD) vision system in January 2007 in the United States and in May 2007 to international markets. The HD vision system provides 20% more viewing area and enhances visualization of tissue planes and critical anatomy compared with our standard vision system. The digital zoom feature in the 3 D HD vision system allows surgeons to magnify the surgical field of view without adjusting the endoscope position and reduces interference between the endoscope and instruments. We believe the new 3 D HD vision system enables improved surgical outcomes. The 3 D HD vision is available as an option on new da Vinci S Surgical Systems and as an upgrade option to our existing customers who own a da Vinci S Surgical System. During 2007, 160 of the 241 total da Vinci Surgical Systems sold were HD systems. We expect a majority of the systems sold in the future to be da Vinci S Systems with HD vision system, but we do not expect 3 D HD upgrades to comprise a significant portion of revenue in the future. During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we launched the 3 arm da Vinci S Surgical System. The 3 arm da Vinci S Surgical System shares the same core functionality of the da Vinci S Surgical System including a streamlined interface, a motorized patient cart, quick click cannula mounts and single use sterile adapters for 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements rapid instrument exchange. The 3 arm da Vinci S Surgical System includes a standard definition 3D vision system and a patient side cart with two instrument arms. The 3 arm da Vinci S Surgical System is an addition to the da Vinci S product line and can be upgraded in the future to the full capability of a 4 arm da Vinci S system with HD vision. We sold six 3 arm da Vinci S Surgical Systems during the year ended December 31, 2007. During the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we introduced the EndoWrist Large Hem o lok&reg; Clip Applier, a new 8mm EndoWrist Clip Applier, that provides the surgeon direct control in placing large Hem o lok&reg; polymer clips. The EndoWrist Large Hem o lok&reg; Clip Applier was developed in collaboration with Teleflex Medical, a division of Teleflex Corporation. Facilities and Information Technology Infrastructure. We have made investments in facilities and information technology infrastructure to support current and future growth. In the year 2007, we entered into an agreement to purchase a building and land, approximately 7 acres, adjacent to our Corporate Headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. The existing building will be demolished and we plan to construct a multi use facility with 154,000 square feet of floor space. We do not anticipate completing construction until late 2009. In addition, we have entered into a three year lease for approximately 34,000 square feet of space in Mexicali, Mexico. We intend to manufacture certain products in this space by the end of fiscal 2008. We have also invested in information technology infrastructure to support our growth. Total capital expenditures for 2007 were $20.3 million. Technology Acquisitions In 2007, we entered into several intellectual property co development arrangements with corporate partners for development in the fiber optic shape sensing area and acquired rights to patents in the flexible robotics area. In December 2007, we reached agreement with California Institute of Technology for a non exclusive use license of its patent portfolio in the field of medical robotics. International Reorganization. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we moved our international headquarters from France to Switzerland. We believe this reorganization will streamline our international operations and optimize our tax structure for the long term. We do not anticipate realizing benefits from the lower tax rates until fiscal 2009 at the earliest. The reorganization plan resulted in costs for relocation of the European operations and certain employees, severance of certain employees, the set up of new facilities and information technology infrastructure, and other costs associated with the transition. Based upon the plan, we incurred reorganization costs of approximately $2.0 million in 2007. 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the years indicated, certain consolidated statements of operations information (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2007 % of TotalRevenue 2006 % of TotalRevenue 2005 % of TotalRevenue Revenue: Products $ 516,089 86 % $ 317,599 85 % $ 192,417 85 % Services 84,739 14 % 55,083 15 % 34,921 15 % Total revenue 600,828 100 % 372,682 100 % 227,338 100 % Cost of revenue: Products 145,654 24 % 97,615 26 % 58,357 26 % Services 40,888 7 % 27,231 7 % 15,412 6 % Total cost of revenue 186,542 31 % 124,846 33 % 73,769 32 % Products gross profit 370,435 62 % 219,984 59 % 134,060 59 % Services gross profit 43,851 7 % 27,852 8 % 19,509 9 % Gross profit 414,286 69 % 247,836 67 % 153,569 68 % Operating costs and expenses: Selling, general and administrative 158,685 27 % 110,703 30 % 67,443 30 % Research and development 48,859 8 % 29,778 8 % 17,354 8 % Total operating costs and expenses 207,544 35 % 140,481 38 % 84,797 38 % Income from operations 206,742 34 % 107,355 29 % 68,772 30 % Interest and other income, net 30,492 5 % 12,783 3 % 5,035 2 % Income before income taxes 237,234 39 % 120,138 32 % 73,807 32 % Income tax expense (benefit) 92,697 15 % 48,094 13 % (20,327 ) 9 % Net income $ 144,537 24 % $ 72,044 19 % $ 94,134 41 % Total Revenue Total revenue increased by 61% and 64% during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Revenue increased from $227.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 to $372.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 to $600.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. Total revenue growth was driven by the continued adoption of da Vinci surgery. We believe that robotic surgery will be adopted surgical procedure by surgical procedure. Our revenue growth during the periods presented reflects adoption progress made in our target procedures. dVP has been our most successful procedure to date and has been a significant sales catalyst. An increasing body of clinical evidence has indicated dVP to offer superior surgical outcomes compared to traditional open prostatectomy in the critical categories of cancer removal, continence, and sexual potency. In 2006 and 2007, dVH has been a much faster growing procedure on a percentage of growth basis. Favorable clinical results have been reported in hysterectomies for cancerous pathology, which include increased lymph node retrieval counts and significant reduction in blood transfusion. For most patients, a minimally invasive approach using the da Vinci Surgical System offers reduced pain, less blood loss, shorter hospital stays and a quicker return to normal daily activities. Revenue within the United States accounted for 78% of total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2007 and 83% of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. We believe domestic revenue accounts for the large majority of total revenue due largely to the competitive nature of the domestic 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements healthcare market. We expect revenue will continue to concentrate in the U.S. market, as U.S. hospitals are generally more willing to invest in technology that will drive incremental patients into their healthcare systems. As adoption progresses and as we reach standard of care for target procedures, we expect international revenue to increase as a percentage of overall revenue. The following table summarizes our revenue and da Vinci Surgical System unit sales for the past three years (in millions, except unit sales and percentages): Revenue 2007 2006 2005 Instruments and accessories $ 191.7 $ 111.7 $ 67.8 Systems 324.4 205.9 124.6 Total product revenue 516.1 317.6 192.4 Services 84.7 55.1 34.9 Total revenue $ 600.8 $ 372.7 $ 227.3 Recurring revenue $ 276.4 $ 166.8 $ 102.7 % of total revenue 46 % 45 % 45 % Domestic $ 468.9 $ 309.9 $ 188.8 International 131.9 62.8 38.5 Total revenue $ 600.8 $ 372.7 $ 227.3 da Vinci Surgical System unit sales 241 170 115 Product Revenue Product revenue increased to $516.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $317.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The $198.5 million (63%) increase reflects higher revenue from sales of instruments and accessories, and systems. Instruments and accessories revenue increased to $191.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, up 72% compared with $111.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase is driven by a similar percentage increase in procedures performed with the da Vinci Surgical System. The hysterectomy procedure was the fastest growing procedure on a percentage basis and prostatectomy was the largest volume procedure. For established accounts in 2007, we recognized an average of $1,500 to $2,000 in instrument and accessory revenue per surgical procedure performed with the da Vinci Surgical System. Total instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was between $2,000 and $2,500 reflecting the impact of initial instrument and accessory purchases for newly installed systems. Instrument and accessory pricing remains unchanged in 2006 and 2007. Systems revenue increased to $324.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $205.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to the growth in the number of system unit sales reflecting adoption of robotic surgery, increased average selling prices (ASPs) resulting from the higher priced da Vinci S and da Vinci S HD Surgical Systems, and the favorable foreign exchange impact of Euro denominated sales. We sold 241 da Vinci Surgical Systems during 2007, compared with 170 systems sold during 2006. The 241 systems sold during 2007 consisted of 160 da Vinci S 3 D HD, 59 da Vinci S 4 arm, 6 da Vinci S 3 arm, and 16 standard da Vinci Surgical Systems. In addition, we recognized revenue from HD and fourth arm upgrades of $4.8 million during year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $4.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. The average revenue recognized per da Vinci system sold increased to $1.3 million in 2007, compared to $1.2 million in 2006. Product revenue increased to $317.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $192.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The $125.2 million (65%) increase reflects higher revenue of instruments and accessories, and systems sales. 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $111.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 from $67.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase is driven by higher adoption rates of robotic surgery. For established accounts in 2006, we recognized an average of $1,500 to $2,000 in instrument and accessory revenue per surgical procedure performed with the da Vinci Surgical System. Total instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was between $2,000 and $2,500 reflecting the impact of initial instrument and accessory purchases for newly installed systems. Instrument and accessory pricing was unchanged from 2005. System revenue increased to $205.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 from $124.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 due to growth in the number of systems sold, reflecting adoption of robotic surgery and increased average selling prices (ASPs) resulting from the successful launch of the higher priced da Vinci S Surgical System. 170 systems were sold during the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to 115 systems during the year ended December 31, 2005. The 170 systems sold during 2006 consisted of 148 da Vinci S Surgical Systems and 22 standard da Vinci Surgical Systems. The average revenue recognized per da Vinci system sold increased to $1.2 million in 2006, compared to $1.0 million in 2005 primarily due to the higher price of da Vinci S Systems. Service Revenue Service revenue, comprised primarily of system service, increased to $84.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $55.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. We typically enter into service contracts at the time the system is sold. These service contracts have been generally renewed at the end of the service period. Higher service revenue for 2007 was driven by a larger base of da Vinci Surgical Systems producing contract service revenue and higher revenue earned per system under service contract. There were approximately 637 systems on average under service contract in 2007 generating an average of $131,000 per system per year, compared to an average of 451 systems under service contract in 2006 generating an average of $118,000 per system per year. The increase in service revenue per system was driven by a higher percentage of the installed base being comprised of da Vinci S and da Vinci S HD Surgical Systems, which carry a higher contractual service rate than standard model da Vinci Systems. Service revenue increased to $55.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $34.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Higher 2006 system service revenue was driven by a larger base of da Vinci Surgical Systems producing contract service revenue and higher revenue earned per system under service contract. There were an average of 451 systems under service contract in 2006 generating an average of $118,000 per system per year, compared to an average of 315 systems under service contract in 2005 generating an average of $108,000 per system per year. The increase in service revenue per system was driven by a higher percentage of the install base being comprised of da Vinci and da Vinci S Surgical Systems in the 2006 installed base, which carry a higher contractual service rate than standard model systems. Gross Profit Product gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $370.4 million, or 72% of product revenue, compared to $220.0 million, or 69% of product revenue, during the year ended December 31, 2006. The higher 2007 product gross profit percentage was driven by the higher 2007 da Vinci Surgical Systems ASPs, instrument and system material cost reductions and leveraging manufacturing costs across higher production volumes. Product gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 included stock based compensation expense of $3.5 million and $2.4 million, respectively. Product gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $220.0 million, or 69% of product revenue, compared to $134.1 million, or 70% of product revenue, during the year ended December 31, 2005. Lower 2006 product profit margins were primarily due to $2.4 million impact of stock option expense that was not included in 2005 results. 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Service gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $43.9 million, or 52% of service revenue, compared to $27.9 million, or 51% of service revenue during the year ended December 31, 2006. The higher 2007 service gross profit reflect leveraging costs over a greater install base. Service gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 included stock based compensation expense of $2.3 million and $1.5 million, respectively. Service gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $27.9 million, or 51% of service revenue, compared to $19.5 million, or 56% of service revenue during the year ended December 31, 2005. Higher 2006 gross profit was driven by increasing service revenue, as described above. The decline in service gross margin was primarily due to costs incurred to support the da Vinci S Surgical System product line and the $1.5 million impact of stock option expenses included in the 2006 results that was not included in 2005 results. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses include costs for sales, marketing and administrative personnel, sales and marketing activities, tradeshow expenses, legal expenses, regulatory fees and general corporate expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2007 were $158.7 million, up 43% from $110.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase is due to organizational growth to support our expanding business, higher commissions and other variable compensation related to higher revenue levels, increased stock based compensation and international reorganization costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in the future to support our expanding business. Stock based compensation expense charged to sales, general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $22.6 million and $16.0 million, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2006 were $110.7 million, up 64% from $67.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily due to stock compensation expense charged to general and administrative expenses of $16.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, sales organization growth, higher commissions relating to higher revenue and additional headcount in various support functions across the organization. Research and Development Expenses Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses include costs associated with the design, development, testing and enhancement of our products. These enhancements represent significant improvements to our products. Research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2007 were $48.9 million, compared to $29.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase is due to the growth in our research and development organization costs associated with co development arrangements, higher prototype expenses, and stock based compensation expense. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we entered into several intellectual property co development arrangements with corporate partners. Costs associated with these co development arrangements were $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Stock based compensation expense charged to research and development expense during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $8.0 million and $5.4 million, respectively. We expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development and anticipate that research and development expenses, including the aforementioned intellectual property development arrangements, will continue to increase in the future. Research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2006 were $29.8 million, compared to $17.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was due to the impact of stock compensation expense charged to research and development of $5.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, growth in our research and development organization, higher prototype expenses, and other project costs. 43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Interest and Other Income, Net Interest and other income, net, was $30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Interest and other income during the year 2007 comprised of $23.3 million in interest income, $4.1 million gain on the sales of publicly traded equity securities and $3.1 million of foreign exchange gains. Interest income increased $11.7 million from interest earned on higher cash and investment balances and higher interest rates. Other income in 2007 increased by $6.0 million due to $4.1 million of gain on the sale of investments in publicly traded equity securities and $1.9 million of foreign exchange gains. Interest and other income, net, comprised mostly of interest income, was $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Interest income was $11.4 million during the year 2006, compared to $5.6 million during the year 2005. The increase between years resulted primarily from higher interest income earned on increasing cash, cash equivalent and investment balances and generally increasing interest rates. Income Tax Expense (Benefit) Our income tax expense (benefit) was $92.7 million, $48.1 million, and ($20.3) million during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2007 is approximately 39.1%, which differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to state income taxes net of federal benefit partially offset by research and development tax credit generated in 2007. The effective tax rate for 2006 is approximately 40.0%, which differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to state income taxes net of federal benefit. Most of the income taxes recorded in fiscal 2007 and 2006 did not result in cash outlays during the year due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards as well as deductions due to employee stock options. Our 2005 income tax included a one time deferred tax benefit of $22.2 million related to the reversal of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter. Management concluded, based upon operating results, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods available to us, and other factors, that it was more likely than not that we would realize sufficient earnings to utilize our deferred tax assets. The recognition of these deferred tax assets had no impact on our cash flows. The effective tax rate for 2005 was approximately (27.5%) and diverged from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily as a result of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards, tax credits and the reversal of valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, partially offset by state income taxes net of federal tax benefit. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards for federal tax purposes of approximately $14.7 million. Of this amount, $12.7 million relates to stock option deductions that will be recognized through additional paid in capital when utilized. As such, these deductions are not reflected in the Companys deferred tax assets. If not utilized, these loss carry forwards will begin to expire in 2021. For state tax purposes, the loss carry forwards are approximately $0.5 million, all of which is reflected in the Companys deferred tax assets. If not utilized, the state loss carry forwards will begin to expire in 2013. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had no recognized research credit carry forwards for both federal and California tax purposes. Various factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our income tax rate. These factors include, but are not limited to, interpretations of existing tax laws, changes in tax laws and tax rates, the accounting for stock options and other share based payments, the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes under FIN 48, mergers and acquisitions, future levels of R&D spending, changes in accounting standards, changes in the mix of earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in overall levels of pre tax earnings, and future federal, state and foreign income tax audits. The impact on our income tax provision resulting from the above mentioned factors may be significant and could have a negative impact on our net income. 44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Liquidity And Capital Resources Sources and Uses of Cash Our principal source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and the exercise of stock options. Cash and cash equivalents plus short and long term investments increased from $202.7 million at December 31, 2005, to $330.3 million at December 31, 2006, to $635.4 million at December 31, 2007. Cash generation is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting our operating, investing and financing needs. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, for a discussion on the impact of interest rate risk and market risk on our investment portfolio. Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in thousands) Net cash provided by (used in) Operating activities $ 205,687 $ 99,845 $ 70,787 Investing activities (236,400 ) (113,353 ) (103,307 ) Financing activities 118,847 42,183 32,316 Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents 301 207 (59 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 88,435 $ 28,882 $ (263 ) Consolidated Cash Flow Data Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2007, cash flow from operations of $205.7 million exceeded our net income of $144.5 million for two primary reasons: 1) Our net income included substantial non cash charges in the form of stock compensation, taxes, and depreciation and amortization of long lived assets. These non cash charges totaled $59.1 million. Also included in our net income is approximately $4.1 million of gain on the sale of publicly traded equity securities which has been classified as an investing activity. 2) We experienced rapid growth in our business with revenues increasing 61% in 2007. However, our net investment in working capital and other operating assets totaled only $2.1 million. Working capital is comprised primarily of accounts receivable, inventory, other current assets, deferred revenue and other current liabilities. Accounts receivable increased $35.7 million or 38% in 2007, reflecting increased revenue and the timing of system sales. Inventory increased $8.2 million or 34% in 2007 due to increased sales volume. Other assets increased by $6.8 million or 99% in 2007, reflecting the timing of payments. Deferred revenue, which includes deferred service contract revenue that is being amortized over the service contract period, increased $17.3 million or 46% in 2007, which is primarily related to the increase in the number of installed systems for which service contracts exist. Other liabilities including accounts payable, accrued compensation and employee benefits, and accrued liabilities increased $35.3 million or 79% in 2007, reflecting changes in the volume of our business and timing of vendor payments. For the year ended December 31, 2006, cash flow from operations of $99.8 million exceeded our net income of $72.0 million for two primary reasons: 1) Our net income included substantial non cash charges in the form of stock compensation, taxes, and depreciation and amortization of long lived assets. These non cash charges totaled $56.0 million. 2) We experienced rapid growth in our business with revenues increasing 64% in 2006. This growth required investment in working capital, particularly accounts receivable and inventory. Our net investment in working capital and other operating assets totaled $28.2 million. 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Working capital is comprised primarily of accounts receivable, inventory, deferred revenue and other current liabilities. Accounts receivable increased $41.9 million or 79% in 2006 reflecting increased revenue and the timing of system sales. Inventory increased $9.0 million or 60% in 2006, slightly less than increased volume. Deferred revenue, which includes deferred service contract revenue that is being amortized over the service contract period, increased $11.9 million or 47% in 2006, which is primarily related to the increase in the number of installed systems for which service contracts exist. Other current liabilities including accounts payable, accrued compensation and employee benefits, and accrued liabilities increased $11.0 million or 33% in 2006. Other accrued liabilities fluctuate with changes in the volume of our business and the timing of vendor payments. For the year ended December 31, 2005, cash flow from operations of $70.8 million was less than our net income of $94.1 million for two primary reasons: 1) we recorded a one time deferred tax benefit of $22.2 million (see Note 9 of the Notes to the Financial Statements). This benefit was non cash. 2) we experienced rapid growth in our business with revenues increasing 64% in 2005. This growth requires investment in working capital, particularly accounts receivable and inventory. Our net investment in working capital and other operating assets totaled $9.7 million. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 consisted primarily of purchases of investments (net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments) of $212.4 million, $95.3 million, and $72.3 million, respectively, and purchases of property and equipment and licensing of patents of $24.0 million, $18.1 million, and $31.0 million, respectively. Our investments are generally in U.S. government agencies, municipal notes which may have an auction reset feature, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, and money market funds and generated approximately 5.1% interest in 2007. We are not a capital intensive business. Our purchases of property and equipment in 2007, 2006 and 2005 related mainly to facilities and information technology infrastructure to support capacity expansion in our business. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities in 2007 and 2006 consisted primarily of proceeds from stock options, employee stock purchases and warrants exercises of $56.0 million and $19.1 million, respectively, and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation of $62.9 million and $23.0 million, respectively. Net cash flows provided by financing activities in 2005 consisted primarily of proceeds from stock options and warrants exercises of $32.9 million. Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents The positive effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents in 2007 and 2006 was due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar during those periods against other foreign currencies, primarily the Euro. The negative effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents in 2005 was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar during that period against other foreign currencies, primarily the Euro. Our capital requirements depend on numerous factors, including market acceptance of our products, the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products and other factors. We expect to devote substantial capital resources to continue our research and development efforts, to expand our customer support and product development activities and for other general corporate activities. During 2007, we experienced significant business expansion. We increased revenue by 61%, invested in new facilities, upgraded our information technology systems, and increased our headcount by 36%. In this high growth year, we generated $144.5 million of net income, which represented the major driver of the net cash provided by operating activities in 2007. Based upon our business model, we anticipate that we will continue to be able to fund future growth through cash 46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements provided from operations. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and investments balances, together with income to be derived from the sale of our products, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Less Than 1Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years Operating leases $ 3,287 $ 1,157 $ 2,110 $ 20 Purchase commitments and obligations 114,884 106,023 7,611 1,250 Purchase of land and building 16,976 16,976 Total contractual obligations $ 135,147 $ 124,156 $ 9,721 $ 1,270 Operating leases: We lease office spaces in the United States and Switzerland and have committed to a lease in Mexico beginning fiscal 2008. We also lease automobiles for certain employees. Operating lease amounts include future minimum lease payments under all our noncancelable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year. Purchase commitments and obligations. These amounts include an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, including commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services and acquisition and licensing of patent rights and patents. A majority of these purchase obligations are due within a year. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services. Purchase of land and building. This represents amounts owed on an agreement to purchase a building and land, approximately 7 acres, adjacent to our Corporate Headquarters in Sunnyvale, California and expected costs to vacate existing tenants in that building. We intend to demolish the existing building and construct a multi use facility with 154,000 square feet of floor space. We do not anticipate completing construction until late 2009. Other commitments. Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when payments may occur for our unrecognized tax benefits. Therefore, our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is not included in the table above. See Note 9 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2007, we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K 40. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, which requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions. Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, describes our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant 47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of consolidated financial statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies. Revenue recognition. We frequently enter into revenue arrangements with customers that contain multiple elements or deliverables such as system and services. Judgments as to the allocation of the proceeds received from an arrangement to the multiple elements of the arrangement, the determination of whether any undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are critical in respect to these arrangements to ensure compliance with GAAP. Changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition. Revenue recognition also depends on the timing of shipment and is subject to customer acceptance. If shipments are not made on scheduled timelines or if the products are not accepted by the customer in a timely manner, our reported revenues may differ materially from expectations. Investments. We have an investment portfolio comprised of marketable debt securities including U.S. government agencies, municipal notes which may have an auction reset feature, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, and money market funds meeting certain criteria. The value of these securities is subject to market volatility for the period we hold these investments and until their sale or maturity. We recognize realized losses when declines in the fair value of our investments, below their cost basis, are judged to be other than temporary. In determining whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary, we consider various factors including market price (when available), investment ratings, the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee, the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis, auction success and failure rates, and our intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. We make significant judgments in considering these factors. If it is judged that a decline in fair value is other than temporary, the investment is valued at the current fair value and a realized loss equal to the decline is reflected in net income, which could materially adversely affect our operating results. Allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts. We record estimated reductions in revenue for potential returns of products by customers and other allowances. As a result, management must make estimates of potential future product returns and other allowances related to current period product revenue. In making such estimates, management analyzes historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products. If management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates, material differences in the amount of reported revenue could result. Similarly, management makes estimates of the uncollectibility of accounts receivables, especially analyzing accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms, when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Credit evaluations are undertaken for all major sale transactions before shipment is authorized. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate aged items in the accounts receivable aging report and provide allowance in an amount we deem adequate for doubtful accounts. If management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates, material differences in the amount of our reported operating expenses could result. Inventory valuation. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first in, first out basis. The carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand. We evaluate the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Accounting for stock options. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R). We use the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model which requires 48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements the input of highly subjective assumptions. These assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them, the estimated volatility of the our common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements. Changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and, consequently, the related amount recognized on the consolidated statements of operations. Impairment of long lived assets. We evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets in accordance with SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets . When events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable, we recognize such impairment in the event the net book value of such assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets. We have intangible assets on our balance sheet related to the acquisition of Computer Motion, Inc. and the acquisition of other patents. The valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful amortization lives involves judgments and the use of estimates. The evaluation of these intangibles for impairment under established accounting guidelines is required on a recurring basis. Changes in business conditions could potentially require future adjustments to asset valuations. We conducted the required intangible assets impairment review during the fourth quarter of 2007. No impairment charge was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. A considerable amount of judgment is required in calculating this impairment charge, principally in determining market premiums and financial forecasts. Should conditions be different from managements current estimates, material write downs of long lived assets may be required, which would adversely affect our operating results. Goodwill. We have goodwill on our balance sheet relating to the acquisition of Computer Motion, Inc. Goodwill is recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. We perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and more frequently if certain indicators are present. In the event we determine that goodwill has been impaired, we will record an accounting charge for the impairment during the fiscal quarter in which the determination is made. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we performed our assessment of whether there was an indication that goodwill was impaired at December 31, 2007. The quoted market price of our common stock was used to determine fair value for the impairment purpose. Our market capitalization continues to support the fair value of our reporting unit. We completed the goodwill impairment tests and determined that the goodwill was not impaired at December 31, 2007. A considerable amount of judgment is required in calculating this impairment charge, principally in determining the reporting units. Should conditions be different from managements current estimates, material write downs of goodwill may be required, which would adversely affect our operating results. Accounting for income taxes. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Beginning fourth quarter of 2005, we released our valuation allowance as we believed that it was more likely than not that we would be able to utilize our deferred tax assets. Management had concluded, based upon operating results, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods available to us, and other factors, that it is more likely than not that we will realize sufficient earnings to utilize our deferred tax assets. As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences that may result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Managements judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets. Any such valuation allowance would be based on management estimates of taxable income and the period over which our deferred tax assets would be recoverable. In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (FAS 109). This interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition of tax benefits, classification on the balance sheet, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. We adopted FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007. FIN 48 requires significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position. Changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently, affect our operating results. Prior to the adoption of FIN 48, we recorded liabilities related to uncertain tax positions based upon Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies.
