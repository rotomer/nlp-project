ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview 2008 Business Events and Trends Products. We design, manufacture and market da Vinci Surgical Systems, which are advanced surgical systems that we believe represent a new generation of surgery. The da Vinci Surgical System consists of a surgeons console, a patient side cart and a high performance vision system. The product line also includes proprietary wristed instruments and surgical accessories. The da Vinci Surgical System seamlessly translates the surgeons natural hand movements on instrument controls at a console into corresponding micro movements of instruments positioned inside the patient through small puncture incisions, or ports. We believe that the da Vinci Surgical 34 Table of Contents System is the only commercially available technology that can provide the surgeon with intuitive control, range of motion, fine tissue manipulation capability and 3 D HD visualization, while simultaneously allowing the surgeons to work through the small ports of minimally invasive surgery, or MIS. By placing computer enhanced technology between the surgeon and the patient, we believe that the da Vinci Surgical System enables surgeons to improve clinical outcomes while reducing the invasiveness of complex surgical procedures. The da Vinci Surgical System is sold into multiple surgical specialties, principally urology, gynecology, cardiothoracic, and general surgery. Business Model. In our business model, we generate revenue from both the initial capital sales of da Vinci Surgical Systems as well as recurring revenue, comprised of instrument, accessory, and service revenue. The da Vinci Surgical System generally sells for approximately $1.0 million to $1.7 million, depending on configuration, and includes one year of service, and represents a significant capital equipment investment for our customers. We then generate recurring revenue as our customers purchase our EndoWrist instruments and accessory products for use in performing procedures with the da Vinci Surgical System. EndoWrist instruments and accessories will either expire or wear out as they are used in surgery and will need to be replaced as they are consumed. We generate additional recurring revenue from ongoing system service. We typically enter into service contracts at the time the system is sold. These service contracts have been generally renewable at the end of the service period, typically at an annual rate of approximately $100,000 to $150,000 per year, depending on configuration of the underlying system. Since the introduction of the da Vinci Surgical System in 1999, our established base of da Vinci Surgical Systems has grown and robotic surgery volume has increased. Recurring revenue has grown at an equal or faster rate than system revenue over the three years ending December 31, 2008. Recurring revenue generated from the sales of instruments and accessories and services increased from $166.8 million, or 45% of total revenue, in 2006 to $276.4 million, or 46% of total revenue, in 2007 to $419.6 million, or 48% of total revenue, in 2008. We expect recurring revenue to become a larger percentage of total revenue in the future. Regulatory Activities We believe that we have obtained all of the clearances required to market our products to our targeted surgical specialties within the United States. As we make additions to target procedures, we will continue to obtain the necessary clearance. The following table lists chronologically our FDA clearances to date: July 2000 General laparoscopic procedures March 2001 Non cardiac thoracoscopic procedures May 2001 Prostatectomy procedures November 2002 Cardiotomy procedures July 2004 Cardiac revascularization procedures March 2005 Urologic surgical procedures April 2005 Gynecologic surgical procedures June 2005 Pediatric surgical procedures In March 2008 we received clearance to market our system held cardiac stabilizer and permission to remove the warning in our labeling regarding system use in non arrested heart procedures. 2008 Business Events and Trends Introduction. We experienced rapid growth during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, which was driven by the continued adoption of the da Vinci Surgical System for use in urologic, gynecologic, cardiothoracic, and general surgeries. 35 Table of Contents 2008 Financial Highlights Procedures grew 60% to approximately 136,000 procedures performed during the year ended December 31, 2008. Total revenue grew 46% to $874.9 million from $600.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. Recurring revenue grew 52% to $419.6 million from $276.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. Instruments and accessories revenue grew 53% to $293.0 million from $191.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. System revenue grew 40% to $455.3 million from $324.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. In the fourth quarter, we experienced a slowdown of system sales as customers postponed purchases due to the current economic environment. This slowdown may affect future system revenue. Revenue per employee grew to approximately $965,000 during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared with $906,000 during the year ended December 31, 2007. We sold 335 da Vinci Surgical Systems during the year ended December 31, 2008; an increase of 39% compared with 241 for the year ended December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2008, we had a da Vinci Surgical System installed base of 1,111 systems, 825 in North America, 194 in Europe, and 92 in the rest of the world. Operating income increased by 50% to $310.8 million, or 36% of revenue, during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $206.7 million, or 34% of revenue, during the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating income included $76.6 million and $36.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, of stock based compensation expense for the estimated fair value of employee stock programs. Our business continues to demonstrate the ability to generate significant positive cash flow while supporting our rapid business growth. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments increased by $266.5 million during 2008, including $44.7 million generated from employee stock programs and $106.0 million of capital expenditure for land, buildings, intellectual property rights and other items and $9.9 million used in addition working capital. We ended fiscal 2008 with $901.9 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments. Procedure adoption We believe the adoption of da Vinci surgery occurs surgical procedure by surgical procedure, and it is being adopted for those procedures which offer significant patient value. The value of a surgical procedure to a patient is higher if it offers superior clinical outcomes, less surgical trauma, or both. The procedures that have driven the most growth in our business recently are the da Vinci Prostatectomy (dVP) and the da Vinci Hysterectomy (dVH). dVP procedures grew approximately 33% in 2008 and represented more than half of all the da Vinci surgical procedures for the year. dVP is now the leading treatment choice for localized prostate cancer in the United States. The dVH procedure was a faster growing procedure from a percentage growth standpoint in 2008, growing approximately 150%. Other urologic procedures such as, da Vinci Nephrectomy, da Vinci Cystectomy, da Vinci Pyeloplasty, other gynecologic procedures such as da Vinci Myomectomy, da Vinci Sacral Colpopexy, cardiothoracic procedures such as da Vinci Mitral Valve Repair, da Vinci Revascularization, and da Vinci Gastric Bypass have also contributed to our growth. dVP and dVH represented approximately 79% of the procedures performed during 2008 and no other procedure represents a significant part of our business at this time. 36 Table of Contents New Products. During the third quarter of fiscal 2008, we launched the EndoWrist Grasping Retractor. The EndoWrist Grasping Retractor is a multi functional 8mm instrument to facilitate soft tissue management. The EndoWrist Grasping Retractor is designed with the primary intent of providing an atraumatic, large profile, multi functional instrument for grasping and retracting abdominal viscera and peritoneal tissue in a totally endoscopic environment, in order to obtain the necessary exposure during pelvic and abdominal procedures. The EndoWrist Grasping Retractor is used in procedures such as hysterectomy for cancer with lymphadenectomy, sacral colpopexy, and low anterior resection. Facilities and Information Technology Infrastructure. We have made investments in facilities and information technology infrastructure to support current and future growth. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we purchased land and a building of approximately 78,200 square feet, in Sunnyvale, California. In addition, we began construction of a 154,000 square feet multi use building on the land we purchased in Sunnyvale, CA during the year ended December 31, 2007. However, due to the current economic climate, we have delayed construction until 2010 at the earliest. We have also invested in information technology infrastructure to support our growth. Total capital expenditures for 2008 were $62.5 million. Technology Acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we made several strategic acquisitions of intellectual property. Total investments in intellectual property during the year ended December 31, 2008 were $43.5 million, compared to $3.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. Amortization expenses related to purchased intellectual property for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $9.8 million, compared to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Revenue increased from $372.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 to $600.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 to $874.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. Total revenue growth was driven by the continued adoption of da Vinci surgery. We believe that robotic surgery will be adopted surgical procedure by surgical procedure. Our revenue growth during the periods presented reflects adoption progress made in our target procedures. dVP has been our most successful procedure to date and has been a significant sales catalyst. An increasing body of clinical evidence has indicated dVP to offer superior surgical outcomes compared to traditional open prostatectomy in the critical categories of cancer removal, continence, and sexual potency. From 2006 through 2008, dVH has been a much faster growing procedure, at approximately 150% during 2008. Favorable clinical results have been reported in hysterectomies for cancerous pathology, which include increased lymph node retrieval counts and significant reduction in blood transfusion. For most patients, a minimally invasive approach using the da Vinci Surgical System offers reduced pain, less blood loss, shorter hospital stays and a quicker return to normal daily activities. Revenue within the United States accounted for 78%, 78% and 83% of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. We believe domestic revenue accounts for the large majority of total revenue due largely to the competitive nature of the domestic healthcare market. The following table summarizes our revenue and da Vinci Surgical System unit sales for the past three years (in millions, except unit sales and percentages): Year Ended December 31, Revenue 2008 2007 2006 Instruments and accessories $ 293.0 $ 191.7 $ 111.7 Systems 455.3 324.4 205.9 Total product revenue 748.3 516.1 317.6 Services 126.6 84.7 55.1 Total revenue $ 874.9 $ 600.8 $ 372.7 Recurring revenue $ 419.6 $ 276.4 $ 166.8 % of total revenue 48 % 46 % 45 % Domestic $ 679.7 $ 468.9 $ 309.9 International 195.2 131.9 62.8 Total revenue $ 874.9 $ 600.8 $ 372.7 da Vinci Surgical System Unit Sales da Vinci S HD 272 160 da Vinci S 4 arm 38 59 148 da Vinci S 3 arm 13 6 standard da Vinci 4 arm 10 10 15 standard da Vinci 3 arm 2 6 7 335 241 170 Domestic Unit Sales 246 174 135 International Unit Sales 89 67 35 Product Revenue Product revenue increased to $748.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 from $516.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. 38 Table of Contents Instruments and accessories revenue increased to $293.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, up 53%, compared with $191.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in revenue is driven by an increase in procedures performed. Procedure growth occurred in all of our targeted procedures with prostatectomy and hysterectomy being the largest drivers of growth. Utilization per installed system for the year ended December 31, 2008 also increased as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. For established accounts in 2008, we recognized an average of $1,500 to $2,000 in instrument and accessory revenue per surgical procedure performed with the da Vinci Surgical System. Total instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was between $2,000 and $2,300 reflecting the impact of initial instrument and accessory purchases for newly installed systems. Instrument and accessory pricing remained unchanged from 2007 to 2008. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure declined during 2008 due to three factors. First, the impact of initial stocking orders decreased as the proportion of new systems sold to the installed base has declined. Secondly, we had a higher mix of procedures that require fewer instruments such as benign dVH procedures. Finally, our customers are becoming more efficient in their use of instruments and accessories as their procedure volumes increase. We expect these factors to continue to cause a decrease in our ratio of instrument and accessory revenue per procedure in 2009. Systems revenue increased to $455.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 from $324.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the growth in the number of system unit sales reflecting adoption of robotic surgery. We sold 335 da Vinci Surgical Systems during 2008, compared with 241 systems sold during 2007. The 335 systems sold during 2008 consisted of 272 da Vinci S HD, 38 da Vinci S 4 arm, 13 da Vinci S 3 arm, and 12 standard da Vinci Surgical Systems. In addition, we recognized revenue from HD and fourth arm upgrades of $5.7 million during year ended December 31, 2008, compared with $4.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. Product revenue increased to $516.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 from $317.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $191.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, up 72%, compared with $111.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was driven by an increase in procedures performed. The hysterectomy procedure was the fastest growing procedure on a percentage basis and prostatectomy was the largest volume growth procedure. For established accounts in 2007, we recognized an average of $1,500 to $2,000 in instrument and accessory revenue per surgical procedure performed with the da Vinci Surgical System. Total instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was between $2,000 and $2,500 reflecting the impact of initial instrument and accessory purchases for newly installed systems. Instrument and accessory pricing remained unchanged from 2006 to 2007. System revenue increased to $324.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 from $205.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 due to growth in the number of systems sold, reflecting adoption of robotic surgery and increased average selling prices (ASP) resulting from the higher priced da Vinci S and da Vinci S HD Surgical Systems, and favorable foreign exchange impact of Euro denominated sales. We sold 241 da Vinci Surgical Systems during 2007, compared with 170 systems sold during 2006. The 241 systems sold during 2007 consisted of 160 da Vinci S HD, 59 da Vinci S 4 arm, 6 da Vinci S 3 arm, and 16 standard da Vinci Surgical Systems. In addition, we recognized revenue from HD and fourth arm upgrades of $4.8 million during year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $4.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. The average revenue recognized per da Vinci system sold increased to $1.33 million in 2007, compared to $1.18 million in 2006. Service Revenue Service revenue, comprised primarily of system service, increased to $126.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $84.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. We typically enter into service 39 Table of Contents contracts at the time the system is sold. These service contracts have been generally renewed at the end of the service period. Higher service revenue for 2008 was driven by a larger base of da Vinci Surgical Systems producing contract service revenue and higher revenue earned per system under service contract. The average service revenue per system was approximately $139,000 during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared with $133,000 during the year ended December 31, 2007. Service revenue increased to $84.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $55.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Higher 2007 system service revenue was driven by a larger base of da Vinci Surgical Systems producing contract service revenue and higher revenue earned per system under service contract. The average service revenue per system was approximately $133,000 during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with $122,000 during the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in service revenue per system was driven by a higher percentage of the installed base being comprised of da Vinci S and da Vinci S HD Surgical Systems, which carry a higher contractual service rate than standard model da Vinci Systems. Gross Profit Product gross profit during the year ended December 31, 2008 was $548.3 million, or 73% of product revenue, compared to $370.4 million, or 72% of product revenue, during the year ended December 31, 2007. The higher 2008 product gross profit was driven by the higher 2008 product revenue, as described above. The higher 2008 product gross profit percentage was driven by instrument and system material cost reductions and leveraging manufacturing costs across higher production volumes. Product gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 reflected stock based compensation expense of $6.3 million and $3.5 million, respectively. Product gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $370.4 million, or 72% of product revenue, compared to $220.0 million, or 69% of product revenue, during the year ended December 31, 2006. The higher 2007 product gross profit percentage was driven by the higher 2007 da Vinci Surgical Systems ASPs, instrument and system material cost reductions and leveraging manufacturing costs across higher production volumes. Product gross profit during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 reflected stock based compensation expense of $3.5 million and $2.4 million, respectively. Service gross profit during the year ended December 31, 2008 was $72.5 million, or 57% of service revenue, compared to $43.9 million, or 52% of service revenue during the year ended December 31, 2007. The higher 2008 service gross profit was driven by a larger installed base. The higher 2008 gross service profit percentage was driven by leveraging service costs across a larger base of installed systems and lower service parts consumption and repair costs per system due to product quality and productivity gains. Service gross profit during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 reflected stock based compensation expense of $5.1 million and $2.3 million, respectively. Service gross profit during the year ended December 31, 2007 was $43.9 million, or 52% of service revenue, compared to $27.9 million, or 51% of service revenue during the year ended December 31, 2006. The higher 2007 service gross profit reflect leveraging costs over a greater installed base. Service gross profit during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 reflected stock based compensation expense of $2.3 million and $1.5 million, respectively. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses include costs for sales, marketing and administrative personnel, sales and marketing activities, tradeshow expenses, legal expenses, regulatory fees and general corporate expenses. 40 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased 45% to $230.6 million compared to $158.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase is due to organizational growth to support our expanding business, higher commissions and other variable compensation related to higher revenue levels, and increased stock based compensation. Stock based compensation expense charged to sales, general and administrative expenses during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $48.2 million and $22.6 million, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2007 were $158.7 million, up 43% from $110.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase is due to organizational growth to support our expanding business, higher commissions and other variable compensation related to higher revenue levels, increased stock based compensation and international reorganization costs. Stock based compensation expense charged to sales, general and administrative expenses during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $22.6 million and $16.0 million, respectively. Research and Development Expenses Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses include costs associated with the design, development, testing and significant enhancement of our products. Research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $62% to $79.4 million compared to $48.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase is due to the growth in our research and development organization, higher costs related to co development licensing arrangements, higher amortization expenses of purchased intellectual property, higher prototype expenses, and higher stock based compensation expense. Amortization expenses related to purchased intellectual property during the year ended December 31, 2008 was $9.8 million, compared to $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. Stock based compensation expense charged to research and development expense during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $17.1 million and $8.0 million, respectively. We expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development and anticipate that research and development expenses, including the co development arrangement with industry partners, will continue to increase in the future. Research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2007 were $48.9 million, compared to $29.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase is due to the growth in our research and development organization costs associated with co development arrangements, higher prototype expenses, and stock based compensation expense. Stock based compensation expense charged to research and development expense during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $8.0 million and $5.4 million, respectively. Interest and Other Income, Net Interest and other income, net, was $24.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decline of $6.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 was due to the non recurring gain on sale of equity securities of $4.1 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2007. In addition, we recorded a foreign exchange loss of $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared with a foreign exchange gain of $3.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. Our foreign exchange loss during fiscal 2008 was primarily due to the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar on Euro based cash and accounts receivable balances, compared to gains resulting from a weakening U.S. dollar in the prior year. In addition, we earned higher interest income, net of $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared with the same period in 2007, reflecting increased investment balance offset by declining interest rates. Interest and other income, net during the year ended December 31, 2008 included a gain of $11.6 million from the Right offered by UBS, largely offset by the losses recorded on the auction rate securities from UBS due to a reclassification of these securities from available for sale to trading. 41 Table of Contents Interest and other income, net, was $30.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase of $17.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 resulted from $11.7 million of interest income earned on higher cash and investment balances and higher interest rates, $4.1 million of gain on the sale of investments in publicly traded equity securities and $1.9 million of foreign exchange gains. Income Tax Expense Our income tax expense was $130.9 million, $92.7 million, and $48.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2008 was approximately 39.0%, which differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to state income taxes net of federal benefit and non deductible stock option compensation, partially offset by research and development tax credit and domestic production deductions generated in 2008. The effective tax rate for 2007 was approximately 39.1%, which differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to state income taxes net of federal benefit, partially offset by research and development tax credit generated in 2007. The effective tax rate for 2006 was approximately 40.0%, which differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily as a result of state income taxes net of federal benefit. A significant portion of the income taxes recorded during years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 did not result in cash outlays during the years due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards as well as tax deductions related to employee stock options. As of December 31, 2008, the Company did not have significant federal and state net operating loss carry forwards that can be utilized to offset future taxable income. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had no recognized research credit carry forwards for both federal and California tax purposes. Liquidity And Capital Resources Sources and Uses of Cash Cash generation is one of the fundamental strengths of our business model and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting our operating, investing and financing needs. Our principal source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and the exercise of stock options. Cash and cash equivalents plus short and long term investments increased from $330.3 million at December 31, 2006, to $635.4 million at December 31, 2007, to $901.9 at December 31, 2008. The increase in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal year 2008 was primarily due to $278.2 million of cash generated from operating activities, $44.7 million of cash provided by stock option exercises and employee stock purchases, and $53.3 million of realized excess tax benefits from share based compensation offset by cash used for capital expenditures of $106.0 million.

These non cash charges totaled $83.9 million. 2) We experienced rapid growth in our business with revenues increasing 46% during the year ended December 31, 2008. Our net investment in working capital and other operating assets totaled $9.9 million. Working capital is comprised primarily of accounts receivable, inventory, deferred revenue and other current liabilities. Accounts receivable increased $39.7 million or 30% in 2008, reflecting increased revenue and the timing of system sales. Inventory increased $31.1 million or 96% in 2008 primarily due to lower than expected system revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Deferred revenue, which includes deferred service contract revenue that is being amortized over the service contract period, increased $24.6 million or 45% in 2008, which is primarily related to the increase in the number of installed systems for which service contracts exist. Other liabilities including accounts payable, accrued compensation and employee benefits, and accrued liabilities increased $32.3 million or 34% in 2008, reflecting changes in the volume of our business, timing of vendor payments and increase in unrecognized tax benefits. During the year ended December 31, 2007, cash flow from operations of $205.7 million exceeded our net income of $144.5 million for two primary reasons: 1) Our net income included substantial non cash charges in the form of stock compensation, taxes, and depreciation and amortization of long lived assets. These non cash charges totaled $59.1 million. Also included in our net income is approximately $4.1 million of gain on the sale of publicly traded equity securities which has been classified as an investing activity. 2) We experienced rapid growth in our business with revenues increasing 61% in 2007. However, our net investment in working capital and other operating assets totaled only $2.1 million. Working capital is comprised primarily of accounts receivable, inventory, other current assets, deferred revenue and other current liabilities. Accounts receivable increased $35.7 million or 38% in 2007, reflecting increased revenue and the timing of system sales. Inventory increased $8.2 million or 34% in 2007 due to increased sales volume. Other assets increased by $6.8 million or 99% in 2007, reflecting the timing of payments. Deferred revenue, which includes deferred service contract revenue that is being amortized over the service contract period, increased $17.3 million or 46% in 2007, which is primarily related to the increase in the number of installed systems for which service contracts exist. Other liabilities including accounts payable, accrued compensation and employee benefits, and accrued liabilities increased $35.3 million or 79% in 2007, reflecting changes in the volume of our business and timing of vendor payments. During the year ended December 31, 2006, cash flow from operations of $99.8 million exceeded our net income of $72.0 million for two primary reasons: 1) Our net income included substantial non cash charges in the form of stock compensation, taxes, and depreciation and amortization of long lived assets. These non cash charges totaled $56.0 million. 2) We experienced rapid growth in our business with revenues increasing 64% in 2006. This growth required investment in working capital, particularly accounts receivable and inventory. Our net investment in working capital and other operating assets totaled $28.2 million. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 consisted primarily of purchases of investments (net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments) of $198.6 million, 43 Table of Contents $212.4 million, and $95.3 million, respectively, and purchases of property and equipment and licensing of intellectual property of $106.0 million, $24.0 million, and $18.1 million, respectively. We invest predominantly in high quality, fixed income securities. Our investment portfolio may at any time contain investments in U.S Treasury and U.S. government agency securities, taxable and or tax exempt municipal notes (some of which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, and money market funds. As of December 31, 2008, the current yield to maturity on our investment portfolio is approximately 3%. We are not a capital intensive business. Our purchases of property and equipment in 2008, 2007, and 2006 related mainly to facilities and information technology infrastructure to support capacity expansion in our business. Similarly, our investments of $43.5 million in acquired intellectual property rights are for use in the development of robotic surgical products. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities in 2008, 2007 and 2006 consisted primarily of proceeds from stock options, employee stock purchases and warrants exercises of $44.7 million, $56.0 million and $19.1 million, respectively, and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation of $53.3 million, $62.9 million and $23.0 million, respectively. The decrease in proceeds from stock options and employee stock purchases during the year ended December 31, 2008 was primarily due to lower stock price during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Our capital requirements depend on numerous factors, including market acceptance of our products, the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products and other factors. We expect to devote substantial capital resources to continue our research and development efforts, to expand our customer support and product development activities and for other general corporate activities. During 2008, despite the economic downturn, we experienced significant business expansion. We increased revenue by 46%, invested in new facilities, invested in several intellectual property rights, and increased our headcount by 37%. We generated $204.3 million of net income, which represented the major driver of the net cash provided by operating activities in 2008. Based upon our business model, we anticipate that we will continue to be able to fund future growth through cash provided from operations. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, together with income to be derived from the sale of our products, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008 (in thousands): Payments due by period Total Less than 1year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years Operating leases $ 2,956 $ 1,298 $ 1,622 $ 36 Purchase commitments and obligations 137,936 116,295 20,391 1,250 Total contractual obligations $ 140,892 $ 117,593 $ 22,013 $ 1,286 Operating leases: We lease office spaces in the United States, Switzerland, and Mexico. We also lease automobiles for certain employees. Operating lease amounts include future minimum lease payments under all our noncancelable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year. Purchase commitments and obligations. These amounts include an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, including commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services and acquisition and licensing of intellectual property. A majority of these purchase obligations are due within a year. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services. 44 Table of Contents Other commitments. Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when payments may occur for our unrecognized tax benefits. Therefore, our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is not included in the table above. See Note 9 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2008, we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K promulgated under the Exchange Act. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, which requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions. Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, describes our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting estimates include: the valuation and recognition of investments, which impacts our investment portfolio balance when we assess fair value, and interest and other income, net, when we record impairments; the valuation of revenue and accounts receivable, which impacts revenue; the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margins; the assessment of recoverability of intangibles and the estimated useful lives, which primarily impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their amortization; the valuation and recognition of share based compensation, which impacts gross margin and operating expenses; and the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes. Investments in Debt Securities Fair Value Our investment portfolio may at any time contain investments in U.S Treasury and U.S. government agency securities, taxable and or tax exempt municipal notes (some of which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, and money market funds. In the current market environment, the assessment of the fair value of the debt securities can be difficult and subjective. The volume of trading activity of certain debt instruments has declined, and the rapid changes occurring in todays financial markets can lead to changes in the fair value of financial instruments in the relatively short periods of time. Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157) establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value (see Note 3: Investments and Fair Value Measurements in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K). Each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value. Level 1 instruments generally represent quoted prices in active markets. Therefore, determining fair value for Level 1 instruments generally does not require significant management judgment, and the estimation is not difficult. 45 Table of Contents Level 2 instruments include inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices for identical instruments in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 instruments include unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The determination of fair value for Level 3 instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity. All of the securities classified as Level 3 instruments are municipal bonds with an auction reset feature (auction rate securities or ARS) whose underlying assets are student loans which are substantially backed by the federal government. These ARS securities represent approximately 10% of our total investment portfolio. In February 2008, auctions began to fail for these securities and each auction since then has failed. Consequently, the investments are not currently liquid. Typically, the fair value of ARS investments approximates par value due to the frequent interest rate resets associated with the auction process. As a result of the auction market cessation, we continue to earn interest on our ARS investments at the contractual rate. Currently, there is not an active market for these securities, and therefore they do not have a readily determinable market value. Accordingly, the estimated fair value of the ARS no longer approximates par value. At December 31, 2008, our investment advisors provided a valuation for the ARS investments utilizing a discounted cash flow approach to arrive at this valuation, which was corroborated by a separate and comparable discounted cash flow analysis we prepared internally. Based on this Level 3 valuation, we valued the ARS investments at $79.1 million, which represents a decline in value of $15.6 million from par. The assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates of, based on data available as of December 31, 2008, interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows, credit and liquidity premiums, and expected holding periods of the ARS. Given the current market environment, these assumptions are volatile and subject to change, thereby could result in significant changes to the fair value of ARS. In November 2008, we accepted an offer (the Right) from UBS AG (UBS), one of our investment providers, entitling us to sell at par value auction rate securities originally purchased from UBS (approximately $71.2 million of par value) at anytime during a two year period from June 30, 2010 through July 2, 2012. In accepting the Right, we granted UBS the authority to sell or auction the ARS at par at any time up until the expiration date of the offer and released UBS from any claims relating to the marketing and sale of ARS. Although we expect to sell our ARS under the Right, if the Right is not exercised before July 2, 2012 it will expire and UBS will have no further rights or obligation to buy our ARS. In lieu of our acceptance of the Right, ARS will continue to accrue and pay interest as determined by the auction process or the terms specified in the prospectus of the ARS if the auction process fails. UBSs obligations under the Right are not secured by its assets and do not require UBS to obtain any financing to support its performance obligations under the Rights. UBS has disclaimed any assurance that it will have sufficient financial resources to satisfy its obligations under the Rights. If UBS has insufficient funding to buy back the ARS and the auction process continues to fail, then we may incur further losses on the carrying value of the ARS. The enforceability of the Right results in a put option and is recognized as a separate freestanding instrument that is accounted for separately from the ARS investment. We elected to account for this put option at fair value under FASB Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities (SFAS 159). We valued the put option using a discounted cash flow approach including estimates of, based on data available as of December 31, 2008, interest rates, timing and amount of cash flow, adjusted for any bearer risk associated with UBSs financial ability to repurchase the ARS beginning June 30, 2010. Any change in these assumptions and market conditions would affect the value of this Right. The value of the put option of $11.6 million, which largely offsets the unrealized loss on the ARS securities subject to the Right is included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2008 as long term investments and on the Statement of Income together with the unrealized loss on the ARS subject to the Right for the year ended December 31, 2008 as Interest and Other Income, net. We believe that subsequent changes in the value of the put option will largely 46 Table of Contents offset the subsequent fair value movements of the ARS, subject to the continued expected performance by the financial institution of its obligations under the agreement. The remaining ARS is held by another investment advisor, who has not made an offer similar to UBS and we continue to classify them as available for sale securities. Accordingly, the change in associated market value has been recorded against other comprehensive income during the year ended December 31, 2008. If the market conditions deteriorate further, we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in other comprehensive income or impairment charges. We may not be able to liquidate these investments unless the issuer calls the security, a successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the auction process, or the security matures. Other than temporary impairment After determining the fair value of our available for sales debt instruments, gains or losses on these securities are recorded to other comprehensive income, until either the security is sold or we determine that the decline in value is other than temporary. The primary differentiating factors considered by us to classify its impairments between temporary and other than temporary impairments are our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, the length of the time and the extent to which the market value of the investment has been less than cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer. Given the current market conditions, these judgments could prove to be wrong, and companies with relatively high credit ratings and solid financial conditions may not be able to fulfill their obligations. No impairment charges were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, our cumulative unrealized gains (losses) related to our investments classified as available for sale was approximately $(3.2) million and 0.4 million, respectively. These unrecognized losses could be recognized in the future if our other than temporary assessment changes. Allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts. We record estimated reductions in revenue for potential returns of products by customers and other allowances. As a result, management must make estimates of potential future product returns and other allowances related to current period product revenue. In making such estimates, management analyzes historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products. If management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates, material differences in the amount of reported revenue could result. Similarly, management makes estimates of the uncollectibility of accounts receivables, especially analyzing accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms, when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Credit evaluations are undertaken for all major sale transactions before shipment is authorized. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate aged items in the accounts receivable aging report and provide allowance in an amount we deem adequate for doubtful accounts. If management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates, material differences in the amount of our reported operating expenses could result. Inventory valuation. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first in, first out basis. The carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand. We evaluate the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Intangible Assets. Our intangible assets include identifiable intangibles and goodwill. Identifiable intangibles include developed technology, patents, and licenses. All of our identifiable intangibles have finite lives. 47 Table of Contents FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142) provides that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to an annual impairment review (or more frequent if impairment indicators arise) by applying a fair value based test. There have been no impairments from the analysis required by SFAS 142. Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are subject to impairment testing as prescribed by FASB Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS 144). Pursuant to the provisions of SFAS 144, identifiable intangibles with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that such assets may not be recoverable at their carrying value. We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of these identifiable intangibles based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from such assets. If the cash flow estimates or the significant operating assumptions upon which they are based change in the future, we may be required to record additional impairment charges. When events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable, we recognize such impairment in the event the net book value of such assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets. We have intangible assets and goodwill on our balance sheet related to the acquisition of Computer Motion, Inc. and the acquisition of other intellectual property. The valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful amortization lives involves judgments and the use of estimates. The evaluation of these intangibles and goodwill for impairment under established accounting guidelines is required on a recurring basis. Changes in business conditions could potentially require future adjustments to asset valuations. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets new, shorter useful lives. We conducted the required intangible assets impairment review during the fourth quarter of 2008. No impairment charge or accelerated amortization was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing impairment, which includes financial forecasts. Should conditions be different from managements current estimates, material write downs of long lived assets may be required, which would adversely affect our operating results. Revenue recognition. We frequently enter into revenue arrangements that contain multiple elements or deliverables such as system and services. Judgments as to the allocation of the proceeds received from an arrangement to the multiple elements of the arrangement, the determination of whether any undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are critical in respect to these arrangements to ensure compliance with GAAP. Changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition. Revenue recognition also depends on the timing of shipment and is subject to customer acceptance. If shipments are not made on scheduled timelines or if the products are not accepted by the customer in a timely manner, our reported revenues may differ materially from expectations. Accounting for stock options. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R). We use the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions. These assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them, the estimated volatility of the our common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements. The assumptions for expected volatility and expected term are the two assumptions that significantly affect the grant date fair value. Changes in expected risk free rate of return do not significantly impact the calculation of fair value, and determining this input is not highly subjective. We use implied volatility based on freely traded options in the open market, as we believe implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility. In determining the appropriateness of implied volatility, we considered the following: the volume of market activity of freely traded options, and determined that there was sufficient market activity; 48 Table of Contents the ability to reasonably match the input variables of freely traded options to those options granted by the Company, such as the date of the grant and the exercise price, and determined that the input assumptions were comparable; and the term of freely traded options used to derive implied volatility, which is generally at least one year, and determined that the length of term was sufficient. The expected term represents the weighted average period that the Companys stock options are expected to be outstanding. The expected term is based on the observed and expected time to post vesting exercise of options by employees. We use historical exercise patterns of previously granted options in relation to stock price movements to derive an employee behavioral pattern used to forecast expected exercise patterns. SFAS 123(R) requires us to develop an estimate of the number of share based awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover. Adjustments in the estimated forfeiture rates can have a significant effect on our reported share based compensation, as we recognize the cumulative effect of the rate adjustments for all expense amortization in the period the estimated forfeiture rates were adjusted. We estimate and adjust forfeiture rates based on a periodic review of recent forfeiture activity and expected future employee turnover. If a revised forfeiture rate is higher than previously estimated forfeiture rate, we may make an adjustment that will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements during the period when the rate was changed. Adjustments in the estimated forfeiture rates could also cause changes in the amount of expense that we recognize in future periods. Changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and, consequently, the related amount recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Accounting for income taxes. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in the current or subsequent period. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover substantially all of the deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2008. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. In accordance with the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of SFAS No. 109 (FIN 48), and related guidance, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, then the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, 49 Table of Contents effective settlement of audit issues, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.
