ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview 2009 Business Events and Trends Products. We design, manufacture and market da Vinci Surgical Systems, which are advanced surgical systems that we believe represent a new generation of surgery. We believe that this new generation of surgery, which we call da Vinci surgery, is a significant advancement similar in scope to previous generations of surgery open surgery and minimally invasive surgery, or conventional MIS. The da Vinci Surgical System consists of a surgeons console, or consoles, a patient side cart and a high performance vision system. The da Vinci Surgical System translates the surgeons natural hand movements performed on instrument controls at a console into corresponding micro movements of instruments positioned inside the patient through small incisions, or ports. We believe that the da Vinci Surgical System provides the surgeon with intuitive control, 37 Table of Contents range of motion, fine tissue manipulation capability and high definition 3 D vision, while simultaneously allowing the surgeons to work through the small ports of MIS. By placing computer enhanced technology between the surgeon and the patient, we believe that the da Vinci Surgical System enables surgeons to improve clinical outcomes while reducing the invasiveness of complex surgical procedures. Business Model. In our business model, we generate revenue from both the initial capital sales of da Vinci Surgical Systems as well as recurring revenue, derived from sales of instruments, accessories, and service revenue. The da Vinci Surgical System generally sells for $1.0 million to $2.3 million, depending on configuration, and represents a significant capital equipment investment for our customers. We then generate recurring revenue as our customers purchase our EndoWrist instruments and accessory products for use in performing procedures with the da Vinci Surgical System. EndoWrist instruments and accessories will either expire or wear out as they are used in surgery and will need to be replaced as they are consumed. We generate additional recurring revenue from ongoing system service. We typically enter into service contracts at the time the system is sold. These service contracts have been generally renewable at the end of the service period, typically at an annual rate of approximately $100,000 to $180,000 per year, depending on the configuration of the underlying system. Since the introduction of the da Vinci Surgical System in 1999, robotic surgery volume has increased and our established base of da Vinci Surgical Systems has grown. Recurring revenue has grown at an equal or faster rate than system revenue. Recurring revenue increased from $276.4 million, or 46% of total revenue in 2007 to $419.6 million, or 48% of total revenue in 2008 to $561.7 million, or 53% of total revenue in 2009. The increase in recurring revenue relative to system revenue reflects continuing adoption of procedures on a growing base of installed da Vinci Surgical Systems. We expect recurring revenue to become a larger percentage of total revenue in the future. The installed base of da Vinci Surgical Systems has grown to 1,395 at December 31, 2009, compared with 1,111 at December 31, 2008 and 795 at December 31, 2007. Regulatory Activities We believe that we have obtained the clearances required to market our products to our targeted surgical specialties within the United States. As we make additions to target procedures, we will continue to seek the necessary clearances. The following table lists chronologically our FDA clearances to date: July 2000 General laparoscopic procedures March 2001 Non cardiac thoracoscopic procedures May 2001 Prostatectomy procedures November 2002 Cardiotomy procedures July 2004 Cardiac revascularization procedures March 2005 Urologic surgical procedures April 2005 Gynecologic surgical procedures June 2005 Pediatric surgical procedures December 2009 Transoral Otolaryngologic surgical procedures In January 2006 we began selling the da Vinci S Surgical System in the United States and Europe. In March 2008 we received clearance in the United States to market our system held cardiac stabilizer and permission to remove the warning in our labeling regarding system use in non arrested heart procedures. During first quarter of 2009, we received clearance to market our da Vinci Si Surgical System in the United States and Europe. In November 2009, we received regulatory (Shonin) approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (MHLW) for our da Vinci S System in Japan. With this approval, we are now focusing on meeting 38 Table of Contents various trade and importation requirements necessary for commercialization and to obtain appropriate reimbursement rates for da Vinci procedures in Japan. We have a separate independent distribution partner in Japan who will be responsible for marketing, selling, and servicing our products in Japan. As of December 31, 2009, we had an installed base of 1,395 da Vinci Surgical Systems. During the year ended December 31, 2009 surgeons using our technology completed approximately 205,000 surgical procedures of various types in major hospitals throughout the world. Out of those da Vinci procedures performed in 2009, approximately 90,000 were da Vinci Prostatectomy (dVP) procedures and approximately 69,000 were da Vinci Hysterectomy (dVH) procedures. 2009 Business Events and Trends Economic Environment. During 2009, the world wide economic recession curtailed hospital demand for capital purchases of our da Vinci Surgical Systems. Demand for our da Vinci Surgical Systems improved towards the end of 2009 and the 338 total da Vinci Surgical Systems sold in 2009 slightly exceeded the 2008 total of 335. da Vinci Si Surgical System Product Launch. During the second quarter of 2009 we launched our newest da Vinci model, the da Vinci Si. The da Vinci Si brings to market three significant innovations. First, our InSite imaging system has been substantially redesigned for increased visual acuity and improved ease of use. The HD imaging systems increased performance is similar to the move from 720p to 1080i in commercial television. We believe that the increased visual performance will continue to increase surgeon precision and confidence and will contribute to improved patient outcomes and shorter procedure times. Secondly, the da Vinci Si surgeons user interface was redesigned to allow simplified and integrated control of da Vinci products and other operating room devices, such as electro surgical units. The new user interface also includes a set of ergonomic controls for surgeon comfort. We believe the simplified interface will allow for easier surgeon training. The third significant improvement is the introduction of a dual surgeons console for use during surgery, which will allow new methods of training da Vinci surgeons and enable collaborative da Vinci surgery. With the da Vinci Si, a surgeon sitting at a second console can view the same surgery as the primary surgeon and can be passed control of some or all of the da Vinci arms during a case. We believe this will both shorten the learning curve for new surgeons and will allow collaborative surgery in complex cases. The da Vinci Si Surgical System was FDA approved and CE marked upon launch and is currently available in the United States and Europe. da Vinci Si Systems are available with an option to purchase a second console. Existing da Vinci S instruments and most da Vinci S accessories are compatible with the da Vinci Si system. An upgrade from a da Vinci S System to the da Vinci Si System is available for our current customers. We will continue to sell, service and support the da Vinci S Surgical System. While we will not be selling the standard da Vinci Surgical System, we will continue to service and support this product line as well. We offered certain of our customers who purchased da Vinci S Surgical Systems in the first quarter of 2009 the opportunity to upgrade their recently purchased da Vinci S Surgical Systems to da Vinci Si Surgical Systems at a discount to the list price of our upgrade. The upgrade program also provided our customers the opportunity to return their recently purchased da Vinci S camera accessories and receive a credit towards the purchase of da Vinci Si camera or other accessories. These customers were given until June 30, 2009 to accept our offer. Total revenue in an amount equal to the discount, of approximately $20.1 million, was deferred in the first quarter of 2009. During the second quarter of 2009, we recognized $13.8 million of revenue from offers declined, upgrades completed or accessories delivered. In the third quarter of 2009, we completed all accepted da Vinci Si system upgrade offers and recognized the remaining $6.3 million deferred revenue. 2009 Financial Highlights Procedures grew 51% to approximately 205,000 procedures performed during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 136,000 procedures performed during the year ended December 31, 2008. 39 Table of Contents Total revenue grew $177 million, or 20%, to $1,052 million during the year ended December 31, 2009 from $875 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. Recurring revenue grew 34% to $562 million during the year ended December 31, 2009 from $420 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. Instruments and accessories revenue grew $96 million, or 33%, to $389 million during the year ended December 31, 2009 from $293 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. System revenue grew 8% to $490 million during the year ended December 31, 2009 from $455 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. We sold 338 da Vinci Surgical Systems during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared with 335 for the year ended December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2009, we had a da Vinci Surgical System installed base of 1,395 systems, 1,028 in the United States, 248 in Europe, and 119 in the rest of the world. Operating income increased by 21% to $377 million, or 36% of revenue, during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $311 million, or 36% of revenue, during the year ended December 31, 2008. Operating income included $97 million and $77 million during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, of stock based compensation expense related to employee stock programs. Our business continues to demonstrate the ability to generate significant positive cash flow while supporting our rapid business growth. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments increased by $270 million during 2009, including $59 million generated from employee stock programs and $38 million provided by additional working capital, offset by $150 million used to repurchase 1.4 million shares and $53 million used for capital expenditure and the purchase of intellectual property. We ended fiscal 2009 with $1,172 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments. Procedure adoption We believe the adoption of da Vinci surgery occurs surgical procedure by surgical procedure, and it is being adopted for those procedures which offer significant patient value. The value of a surgical procedure to a patient is higher if it offers superior clinical outcomes, less surgical trauma, or both. Procedures grew 51% to approximately 205,000 procedures performed during the year ended December 31, 2009. The procedures that have driven the most growth in our business recently are the da Vinci Hysterectomy (dVH) and da Vinci Prostatectomy (dVP), which grew 101% and 23%, to approximately 69,000 and 90,000 procedures, respectively, in 2009. dVP is now the leading treatment choice for localized prostate cancer in the United States. While total dVH procedures were less than dVP procedures in 2009, dVH was a faster growing procedure from a percentage growth standpoint in 2009, and based on a larger market size, is expected to exceed dVP procedures in 2010. Other urologic procedures such as, da Vinci Nephrectomy, da Vinci Cystectomy, da Vinci Pyeloplasty, other gynecologic procedures such as da Vinci Myomectomy, da Vinci Sacral Colpopexy, cardiothoracic procedures such as da Vinci Mitral Valve Repair, da Vinci Revascularization, general surgery procedures such as the da Vinci Thyroidectomy, da Vinci Low Anterior Resection, and da Vinci Gastric Bypass have also contributed to our growth. 40 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the years indicated, certain consolidated statements of income information (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2009 % of totalrevenue 2008 % of totalrevenue 2007 % of totalrevenue Revenue: Products $ 879,901 84 % $ 748,325 86 % $ 516,089 86 % Services 172,267 16 % 126,594 14 % 84,739 14 % Total revenue 1,052,168 100 % 874,919 100 % 600,828 100 % Cost of revenue: Products $ 237,562 23 % $ 200,074 23 % 145,654 24 % Services 63,554 6 % 54,068 6 % 40,888 7 % Total cost of revenue 301,116 29 % 254,142 29 % 186,542 31 % Products gross profit 642,339 61 % 548,251 63 % 370,435 62 % Services gross profit 108,713 10 % 72,526 8 % 43,851 7 % Gross profit 751,052 71 % 620,777 71 % 414,286 69 % Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative $ 278,511 26 % $ 230,570 26 % 158,685 27 % Research and development 95,102 9 % 79,372 9 % 48,859 8 % Total operating expenses 373,613 35 % 309,942 35 % 207,544 35 % Income from operations 377,439 36 % 310,835 36 % 206,742 34 % Interest and other income, net 18,672 2 % 24,368 2 % 30,492 5 % Income before income taxes 396,111 38 % 335,203 38 % 237,234 39 % Income tax expense 163,505 16 % 130,888 15 % 92,697 15 % Net income $ 232,606 22 % $ 204,315 23 % $ 144,537 24 % Total Revenue Total revenue increased by 20%, 46% and 61% during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Revenue increased from $600.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 to $874.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 to $1,052.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. Total revenue growth was driven by the continued adoption of da Vinci surgery. We believe that robotic surgery will be adopted surgical procedure by surgical procedure. Our revenue growth during the periods presented reflects adoption progress made in our target procedures. dVH and dVP have been our most successful procedures to date and have been significant sales catalysts. An increasing body of clinical evidence has indicated dVP to offer superior surgical outcomes compared to traditional open prostatectomy in the critical categories of cancer removal, continence, and sexual potency. From 2007 through 2009, dVH has been among one of our fastest growing procedures and we expect dVH procedures to exceed dVP procedures in 2010. Favorable clinical results have been reported in hysterectomies for cancerous pathology, which include increased lymph node retrieval counts and significant reduction in blood transfusion. For most patients, a minimally invasive approach using the da Vinci Surgical System offers reduced pain, less blood loss, shorter hospital stays and a quicker return to normal daily activities. Revenue within the United States accounted for 79%, 78%, and 78% of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. We believe domestic revenue accounts for the large majority of total revenue due largely to the ability of patients to select their healthcare providers in the United States. 41 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our revenue and da Vinci Surgical System unit sales for the past three years (in thousands, except unit sales and percentages): Year Ended December 31, Revenue 2009 2008 2007 Instruments and accessories $ 389,445 $ 292,989 $ 191,651 Systems 490,456 455,336 324,438 Total product revenue 879,901 748,325 516,089 Services 172,267 126,594 84,739 Total revenue $ 1,052,168 $ 874,919 600,828 Recurring revenue 561,712 419,583 276,390 % of total revenue 53 % 48 % 46 % Revenue Domestic 827,005 679,682 468,938 Revenue International 225,163 195,237 131,890 Total revenue 1,052,168 874,919 600,828 Domestic Unit Sales 252 246 174 International Unit Sales 86 89 67 Total Unit Sales 338 335 241 Product Revenue Product revenue increased to $879.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2009 from $748.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. Instruments and accessories revenue increased to $389.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, up 33%, compared with $293.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in revenue is driven by an increase in procedures performed. Procedure growth occurred in all of our targeted procedures with dVH and dVP being the largest drivers of growth. Utilization per installed system for the year ended December 31, 2009 also increased as compared with the year ended December 31, 2008. Instrument and accessory pricing remained unchanged from 2008 to 2009. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure declined approximately 12% during 2009 primarily due to the impact of initial stocking orders. The amount of revenue related to stocking orders is less impactful as the base of installed systems grows. In addition, we believe our customers are becoming more efficient in their use of instruments and accessories as their procedure volumes increase. We expect these factors to continue to cause a decrease in our ratio of instrument and accessory revenue per procedure in 2010. Systems revenue increased to $490.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2009 from $455.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to more 2009 system upgrade revenue, higher 2009 average selling price (ASP), and 3 more systems sold. System upgrade revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased to $19.2 million compared to $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, driven by the impact of 2009 da Vinci Si system upgrades. The 2009 ASP of $1.39 million was higher than the 2008 ASP of $1.34 million, primarily associated with the introduction of the da Vinci Si systems. We sold 338 da Vinci Surgical Systems during 2009, compared with 335 systems sold during 2008. 209 of 338 systems sold during 2009 were da Vinci Si Systems. Product revenue increased to $748.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 from $516.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. Instruments and accessories revenue increased to $293.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, up 53%, compared with $191.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in revenue is driven by 42 Table of Contents an increase in procedures performed. Procedure growth occurred in all of our targeted procedures with dVH and dVP being the largest drivers of growth. Utilization per installed system for the year ended December 31, 2008 also increased as compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. Total instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was between $2,000 and $2,300. Instrument and accessory pricing remained unchanged from 2007 to 2008. Systems revenue increased to $455.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 from $324.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the growth in the number of system unit sales reflecting adoption of robotic surgery. We sold 335 da Vinci Surgical Systems during 2008, compared with 241 systems sold during 2007. In addition, we recognized revenue from HD and fourth arm upgrades of $5.7 million during year ended December 31, 2008, compared with $4.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. Service Revenue Service revenue, comprised primarily of system service, increased to $172.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $126.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. We typically enter into service contracts at the time the system is sold. These service contracts have been generally renewed at the end of the service period. Higher service revenue for 2009 was driven by a larger base of da Vinci Surgical Systems and higher priced da Vinci Si service contract billings. The average service revenue per system was approximately $143,000 during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared with $139,000 during the year ended December 31, 2008, increasing primarily due to the slightly higher da Vinci Si contract rates. Service revenue, comprised primarily of system service, increased to $126.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $84.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Higher service revenue for 2008 was driven by a larger base of da Vinci Surgical Systems producing contract service revenue and higher revenue earned per system under service contract. The average service revenue per system was approximately $139,000 during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared with $133,000 during the year ended December 31, 2007. Gross Profit Product gross profit during the year ended December 31, 2009 was $642.3 million, or 73.0% of product revenue, compared to $548.3 million, or 73.3% of product revenue, during the year ended December 31, 2008. The higher 2009 product gross profit was driven by the higher 2009 product revenue, as described above. The slightly lower 2009 product gross profit percentage was driven by lower margins associated with the launch of da Vinci Si. Product gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 reflected stock based compensation expense of $7.7 million and $6.3 million, respectively. Product gross profit during the year ended December 31, 2008 was $548.3 million, or 73.3% of product revenue, compared to $370.4 million, or 71.8% of product revenue, during the year ended December 31, 2007. The higher 2008 product gross profit was driven by the higher 2008 product revenue, as described above. The higher 2008 product gross profit percentage was driven by instrument and system material cost reductions and leveraging manufacturing costs across higher production volumes. Product gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 reflected stock based compensation expense of $6.3 million and $3.5 million, respectively. Service gross profit during the year ended December 31, 2009 was $108.7 million, or 63.1% of service revenue, compared to $72.5 million, or 57.3% of service revenue during the year ended December 31, 2008. The higher 2009 service gross profit was driven by a larger installed base. The higher 2009 gross service profit percentage was driven by leveraging service costs across a larger base of installed systems and lower service parts consumption and repair costs per system due to product quality and productivity gains. Service gross profit during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 reflected stock based compensation expense of $6.6 million and $5.1 million, respectively. 43 Table of Contents Service gross profit during the year ended December 31, 2008 was $72.5 million, or 57.3% of service revenue, compared to $43.9 million, or 51.7% of service revenue during the year ended December 31, 2007. The higher 2008 service gross profit was driven by a larger installed base. The higher 2008 gross service profit percentage was driven by leveraging service costs across a larger base of installed systems and lower service parts consumption and repair costs per system due to product quality and productivity gains. Service gross profit during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 reflected stock based compensation expense of $5.1 million and $2.3 million, respectively. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses include costs for sales, marketing and administrative personnel, sales and marketing activities, tradeshow expenses, legal expenses, regulatory fees and general corporate expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 21% to $278.5 million compared to $230.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase is due to organizational growth to support our expanding business, particularly in U.S. field sales, higher commissions and other variable compensation related to higher revenue levels, and increased stock based compensation. Stock based compensation expense charged to sales, general and administrative expenses during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $61.3 million and $48.2 million, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased 45% to $230.6 million compared to $158.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase is due to organizational growth to support our expanding business, higher commissions and other variable compensation related to higher revenue levels, and increased stock based compensation. Stock based compensation expense charged to sales, general and administrative expenses during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $48.2 million and $22.6 million, respectively. Research and Development Expenses Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses include costs associated with the design, development, testing and significant enhancement of our products. Research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 20% to $95.1 million compared to $79.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase is due to the growth in our research and development organization, higher prototype expenses, higher amortization expenses of purchased intellectual property, and higher stock based compensation expense. Amortization expenses related to purchased intellectual property during the year ended December 31, 2009 was $14.4 million, compared to $9.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. Stock based compensation expense charged to research and development expense during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $21.4 million and $17.1 million, respectively. We expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development and anticipate that research and development expenses, including the co development arrangement with industry partners, will continue to increase in the future. Research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2008 increased 62% to $79.4 million compared to $48.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase is due to the growth in our research and development organization, higher costs related to co development licensing arrangements, higher amortization expenses of purchased intellectual property, higher prototype expenses, and higher stock based compensation expense. Amortization expenses related to purchased intellectual property during the year ended December 31, 2008 was $9.1 million, compared to $0.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. Stock based compensation expense charged to research and development expense during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $17.1 million and $8.0 million, respectively. 44 Table of Contents Interest and Other Income, Net Interest and other income, net, was $18.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $24.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decline of $5.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2009 was primarily due to lower interest rates earned on cash and investment balances in 2009. Interest and other income, net, was $24.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decline of $6.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 was primarily due to the non recurring gain on sale of equity securities of $4.1 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2007. Income Tax Expense Our income tax expense was $163.5 million, $130.9 million, and $92.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2009 was approximately 41.3%, which differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to state income taxes net of federal benefit and non deductible stock option compensation, partially offset by research and development tax credit and domestic production deductions generated in 2009. The effective tax rate for 2008 was approximately 39.0%, which differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to state income taxes net of federal benefit and non deductible stock option compensation, partially offset by research and development tax credit and domestic production deductions generated in 2008. The effective tax rate for 2007 was approximately 39.1%, which differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to state income taxes net of federal benefit, partially offset by research and development tax credit generated in 2007. A significant portion of the income taxes recorded during years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 did not result in cash outlays during the years due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards as well as tax deductions related to employee stock options. A California tax law change enacted in February 2009 allows an elective single sales factor for state apportionment for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2011. We expect to benefit from the California single sales factor election for apportioning income for years 2011 and beyond. As a result of our anticipated election of the single sales factor, in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, we have re measured our deferred tax assets taking into account the reversal pattern and the expected California tax rate under the elective single sales factor. The impact of this change resulted in a decrease to California beginning deferred tax assets of $1.6 million and this charge was recorded in the our income tax provision during the first quarter of 2009. Liquidity And Capital Resources Sources and Uses of Cash Cash generation is one of the fundamental strengths of our business model and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting our operating, investing and financing needs. Our principal source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and the exercise of stock options. Cash and cash equivalents plus short and long term investments increased from $635.4 million at December 31, 2007, to $901.9 million at December 31, 2008, to $1,172 million at December 31, 2009. The increase in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to $385.1 million of cash generated from operating activities, $58.7 million of cash provided by stock option exercises and employee stock purchases, and $25.1 million of realized excess tax benefits from share based compensation offset by $150.0 million used in the repurchase of 1.4 million shares of our common stock and capital expenditures of $53.4 million. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for discussion on impact of interest rate risk and market risk on our investment portfolio. 45 Table of Contents Consolidated Cash Flow Data Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (in thousands) Net cash provided by (used in) Operating activities $ 385,055 $ 278,235 $ 205,687 Investing activities (292,377 ) (304,528 ) (236,400 ) Financing activities (66,169 ) 97,980 118,847 Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents 305 111 301 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 26,814 $ 71,798 $ 88,435 Operating Activities During the year ended December 31, 2009, cash flow from operations of $385.1 million exceeded our net income of $232.6 million for two primary reasons: 1) Our net income included substantial non cash charges in the form of stock compensation, deferred taxes, and depreciation of long lived assets and amortization of purchased intellectual property. These non cash charges totaled $114.4 million. 2) Cash provided by working capital and other assets during the year ended December 31, 2009 was approximately $38.0 million. Working capital is comprised primarily of accounts receivable, deferred revenue and other liabilities. Accounts receivable increased $35.3 million or 21% in 2009, primarily reflecting increased revenue. Deferred revenue, which includes deferred service contract revenue that is being amortized over the service contract period, increased $21.3 million or 27% in 2009, which is primarily related to the increase in the number of installed systems for which service contracts exist. Other liabilities including accounts payable, accrued compensation and employee benefits, and accrued liabilities increased $52.5 million or 41% in 2009, reflecting changes in the volume of our business and timing of vendor payments and increase in unrecognized tax benefits. During the year ended December 31, 2008, cash flow from operations of $278.2 million exceeded our net income of $204.3 million for two primary reasons: 1) Our net income included substantial non cash charges in the form of stock compensation, taxes, and depreciation of long lived assets and amortization of purchased intellectual property. These non cash charges totaled $83.9 million. 2) We experienced rapid growth in our business with revenues increasing 46% during the year ended December 31, 2008. Our net investment in working capital and other operating assets totaled $9.9 million. Working capital is comprised primarily of accounts receivable, inventory, deferred revenue and other current liabilities. Accounts receivable increased $39.7 million or 30% in 2008, primarily reflecting increased revenue. Inventory increased $31.1 million or 96% in 2008 primarily due to lower than expected system revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Deferred revenue, which includes deferred service contract revenue that is being amortized over the service contract period, increased $24.6 million or 45% in 2008, which is primarily related to the increase in the number of installed systems for which service contracts exist. Other liabilities including accounts payable, accrued compensation and employee benefits, and accrued liabilities increased $32.3 million or 34% in 2008, reflecting changes in the volume of our business, timing of vendor payments and increase in unrecognized tax benefits. 46 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2007, cash flow from operations of $205.7 million exceeded our net income of $144.5 million for two primary reasons: 1) Our net income included substantial non cash charges in the form of stock compensation, taxes, and depreciation and amortization of long lived assets. These non cash charges totaled $59.1 million. Also included in our net income is approximately $4.1 million of gain on the sale of publicly traded equity securities which has been classified as an investing activity. 2) We experienced rapid growth in our business with revenues increasing 61% in 2007. However, our net investment in working capital and other operating assets totaled only $2.1 million. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 consisted primarily of purchases of investments (net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments) of $239.0 million, $198.6 million and $212.4 million, respectively, and purchases of property and equipment and licensing of intellectual property of $53.4 millions, $106.0 million and $24.0 million, respectively. We invest predominantly in high quality, fixed income securities. Our investment portfolio may at any time contain investments in U.S Treasury and U.S. government agency securities, taxable and or tax exempt municipal notes (some of which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, cash deposits and money market funds. We are not a capital intensive business. Our purchases of property and equipment in 2009, 2008, and 2007 related mainly to facilities and information technology infrastructure to support capacity expansion in our business. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities in 2009 consisted primarily of $150.0 million used for the repurchase of 1.4 million shares of our common stock through our accelerated repurchase program, offset by proceeds from stock options and employee stock purchases of $58.7 million, and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation of $25.1 million. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2008 and 2007 consisted primarily of proceeds from stock options, employee stock purchases and warrants exercises of $44.7 million and $56.0 million, respectively, and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation of $53.3 million and $62.9 million, respectively. Our capital requirements depend on numerous factors, including market acceptance of our products, the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products and other factors. We expect to devote substantial capital resources to continue our research and development efforts, to expand our customer support and product development activities and for other general corporate activities. During 2009, despite the economic downturn, we experienced significant business expansion. We increased revenue by 20%, invested in new facilities, invested in several intellectual property rights, and increased our headcount by 20%. We generated $232.6 million of net income, which represented the major driver of the net cash provided by operating activities in 2009. Based upon our business model, we anticipate that we will continue to be able to fund future growth through cash provided from operations. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, together with income to be derived from the sale of our products, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. 47 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009 (in thousands): Payments due by period Total Less than 1year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years Operating leases $ 3,363 $ 1,759 $ 1,591 $ 13 Purchase commitments and obligations 145,097 142,714 1,967 416 Total contractual obligations $ 148,460 $ 144,473 $ 3,558 $ 429 Operating leases. We lease office spaces in the United States, Switzerland, Mexico and China. We also lease automobiles for certain sales employees. Operating lease amounts include future minimum lease payments under all our noncancelable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year. Purchase commitments and obligations. These amounts include an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, including commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services and acquisition and licensing of intellectual property. A majority of these purchase obligations are due within a year. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services. Other commitments. Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the new accounting guidance for unrecognized tax benefits. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when payments may occur for our unrecognized tax benefits. Therefore, our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is not included in the table above. See Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2009, we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K promulgated under the Exchange Act. Critical Accounting Estimates Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions. Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, describes our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting estimates include: the valuation and recognition of investments, which impacts our investment portfolio balance when we assess fair value, and interest and other income, net, when we record impairments; the valuation of revenue and allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts, which impacts revenue; the estimation of transactions to hedge, which impacts revenue and other expense; the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margins; the assessment of recoverability of intangibles and the estimated useful lives, which primarily impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their amortization; the valuation and recognition of share based compensation, which impacts gross margin and operating expenses; and 48 Table of Contents the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes. Investments in Debt Securities Fair Value Our investment portfolio may at any time contain investments in U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities, taxable and or tax exempt municipal notes (some of which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, cash deposits and money market funds. In the current market environment, the assessment of the fair value of the debt securities can be difficult and subjective. U.S. GAAP establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value (see Note 4. Fair Value Measurements in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K). Each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value. Valuation of Level 1 and 2 instruments generally do not require significant management judgment and the estimation is not difficult. Level 3 instruments include unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The determination of fair value for Level 3 instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity. All of the securities classified as Level 3 instruments are municipal bonds with an auction reset feature (auction rate securities or ARS) whose underlying assets are student loans which are substantially backed by the federal government. These ARS securities represent less than 10% of our total investment portfolio. Since the auctions for these securities have continued to fail since February 2008, these investments are not currently trading and therefore do not have a readily determinable market value. Accordingly, the estimated fair value of the ARS no longer approximates par value. A large portion of these ARS are held by UBS AG (UBS), one of the Companys investment providers. In November 2008, the Company accepted an offer (the Right) from UBS entitling the Company to sell at par value auction rate securities originally purchased from UBS (approximately $69.9 million, par value) at anytime during a two year period from June 30, 2010 through July 2, 2012. The Company has valued the ARS and put option using a discounted cash flow model based on Level 3 assumptions. The assumptions used in valuing the ARS and the put option include estimates of, based on data available as of December 31, 2009, interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows, credit and liquidity premiums, expected holding periods of the ARS, loan rates per the UBS Rights offering and bearer risk associated with UBSs financial ability to repurchase the ARS beginning June 30, 2010. Given the current market environment, these assumptions are volatile and subject to change, thereby could result in significant changes to the fair value of ARS. The Company intends to exercise the Right from UBS on June 30, 2010 and as a result has classified these ARS as trading securities and recorded under short term investments as of December 31, 2009. If UBS has insufficient funding to buy back the ARS and the auction process continues to fail, then we may incur further losses on the carrying value of the ARS. The remaining ARS (approximately $23.5 million, par value) is held by another investment advisor, who has not made an offer similar to UBS and we continue to classify them as available for sales securities. Accordingly, the change in associated market value has been recorded against other comprehensive income during the year ended December 31, 2009. If market conditions deteriorate further, we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in other comprehensive income or impairment charges. We may not be able to liquidate these investments unless the issuer calls the security, a successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the auction process, or the security matures. Other than temporary impairment After determining the fair value of our available for sales debt instruments, gains or losses on these securities are recorded to other comprehensive income, until either the security is sold or we determine that the decline in value is other than temporary. The primary differentiating factors considered by us to classify its impairments between temporary and other than temporary impairments are our intent and ability to retain our 49 Table of Contents investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, the length of the time and the extent to which the market value of the investment has been less than cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer. Given the current market conditions, these judgments could prove to be wrong, and companies with relatively high credit ratings and solid financial conditions may not be able to fulfill their obligations. No impairment charges were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, our cumulative unrealized gains (losses) related to our investments classified as available for sale was approximately $0.8 million and $(3.2) million, respectively. These unrecognized losses could be recognized in the future if our other than temporary assessment changes. Allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts. We record estimated reductions in revenue for potential returns of products by customers and other allowances. As a result, management must make estimates of potential future product returns and other allowances related to current period product revenue. In making such estimates, management analyzes historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products. If management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates, material differences in the amount of reported revenue could result. Similarly, management makes estimates of the uncollectibility of accounts receivables, especially analyzing accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms, when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Credit evaluations are undertaken for all major sale transactions before shipment is authorized. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate aged items in the accounts receivable aging report and provide allowance in an amount we deem adequate for doubtful accounts. If management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates, material differences in the amount of our reported operating expenses could result. Inventory valuation. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first in, first out basis. The carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand. We evaluate the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Intangible Assets. Our intangible assets include identifiable intangibles and goodwill. Identifiable intangibles include developed technology, patents, and licenses. All of our identifiable intangibles have finite lives. ASC 350 provides that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to an annual impairment review (or more frequent if impairment indicators arise) by applying a fair value based test. There have been no impairments from the analysis required by ASC 350. Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are subject to impairment testing as prescribed by U.S. GAAP. Pursuant to the provisions U.S. GAAP, identifiable intangibles with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that such assets may not be recoverable at their carrying value. We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of these identifiable intangibles based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from such assets. If the cash flow estimates or the significant operating assumptions upon which they are based change in the future, we may be required to record additional impairment charges. When events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable, we recognize such impairment in the event the net book value of such assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets. 50 Table of Contents We have intangible assets and goodwill on our balance sheet related to the acquisition of Computer Motion, Inc. and the acquisition of other intellectual property. The valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful amortization lives involves judgments and the use of estimates. The evaluation of these intangibles and goodwill for impairment under established accounting guidelines is required on a recurring basis. Changes in business conditions could potentially require future adjustments to asset valuations. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets new, shorter useful lives. We conducted the required intangible assets impairment review during the fourth quarter of 2009. No impairment charge or material accelerated amortization was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing impairment, which includes financial forecasts. Should conditions be different from managements current estimates, material write downs of long lived assets may be required, which would adversely affect our operating results. Revenue recognition. We frequently enter into revenue arrangements that contain multiple elements or deliverables such as system and services. Judgments as to the allocation of the proceeds received from an arrangement to the multiple elements of the arrangement, the determination of whether any undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are critical in respect to these arrangements to ensure compliance with U.S. GAAP. Changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition. Revenue recognition also depends on the timing of shipment and is subject to customer acceptance. If shipments are not made on scheduled timelines or if the products are not accepted by the customer in a timely manner, our reported revenues may differ materially from expectations. Hedge Accounting for Derivatives. We utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency sales transactions. When specific criteria required by ASC 815 have been met, changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI) rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When we determine that the transactions are no longer probable within a certain time frame, we are required to reclassify the cumulative changes in the fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to net income. Accounting for stock options. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718. We use the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions. These assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them, the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements. The assumptions for expected volatility and expected term are the two assumptions that significantly affect the grant date fair value. Changes in expected risk free rate of return do not significantly impact the calculation of fair value, and determining this input is not highly subjective. We use implied volatility based on freely traded options in the open market, as we believe implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility. In determining the appropriateness of implied volatility, we considered the following: the volume of market activity of freely traded options, and determined that there was sufficient market activity; the ability to reasonably match the input variables of freely traded options to those options granted by the Company, such as the date of the grant and the exercise price, and determined that the input assumptions were comparable; and the term of freely traded options used to derive implied volatility, which is generally at least one year, and determined that the length of term was sufficient. 51 Table of Contents The expected term represents the weighted average period that the Companys stock options are expected to be outstanding. The expected term is based on the observed and expected time to post vesting exercise of options by employees. We use historical exercise patterns of previously granted options in relation to stock price movements to derive an employee behavioral pattern used to forecast expected exercise patterns. ASC 718 requires us to develop an estimate of the number of share based awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover. Adjustments in the estimated forfeiture rates can have a significant effect on our reported share based compensation, as we recognize the cumulative effect of the rate adjustments for all expense amortization in the period the estimated forfeiture rates were adjusted. We estimate and adjust forfeiture rates based on a periodic review of recent forfeiture activity and expected future employee turnover. If a revised forfeiture rate is higher than previously estimated forfeiture rate, we may make an adjustment that will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements during the period when the rate was changed. Adjustments in the estimated forfeiture rates could also cause changes in the amount of expense that we recognize in future periods. Changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and, consequently, the related amount recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Accounting for income taxes. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets in accordance with ASC 740. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in the current or subsequent period. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is less than a 50% likelihood, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover substantially all of the deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2009. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which such change takes place. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. In accordance with the ASC 740 and related guidance, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, then the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effective settlement of audit issues, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.
