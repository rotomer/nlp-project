ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview 2010 Business Events and Trends Products. We design, manufacture and market da Vinci Surgical Systems, which are advanced surgical systems that we believe represent a new generation of surgery. We believe that this new generation of surgery, which we call da Vinci surgery, is a significant advancement similar in scope to previous generations of surgery open surgery and minimally invasive surgery, or conventional MIS. The da Vinci Surgical System consists of a surgeons console, or consoles, a patient side cart and a high performance vision system. The da Vinci Surgical System translates the surgeons natural hand movements, which are performed on instrument controls at a console, into corresponding micro movements of instruments positioned inside the patient through small incisions, or ports. We believe that the da Vinci Surgical System provides the surgeon with intuitive control, range of motion, fine tissue manipulation capability and high definition 3 D vision, while simultaneously allowing the surgeons to work through the small ports of MIS. By placing computer enhanced technology between the surgeon and the patient, we believe that the da Vinci Surgical System enables surgeons to deliver higher value minimally invasive surgical procedures to their patients. We model patient value as equal to: procedure efficacy / invasiveness. Here procedure efficacy is a 40 Table of Contents measure of the success of the surgery in resolving the underlying disease and invasiveness is how disruptive and painful the treatment is itself. When the patient value of robotic surgery is significantly higher than competing treatment options, we have seen that patients will seek out surgeons and hospitals that offer da Vinci procedures, potentially driving a disruptive change in the marketplace and can lead to the broad adoption of robotic surgery. These adoptions occur procedure by procedure, and are driven by the relative patient value of da Vinci procedures against alternatives for the same disease state. Business Model. In our business model, we generate revenue from both the initial capital sales of da Vinci Surgical Systems as well as recurring revenue, derived from sales of instruments, accessories and service. The da Vinci Surgical System generally sells for between $1.0 million and $2.3 million, depending on configuration and geography, and represents a significant capital equipment investment for our customers. We then generate recurring revenue as our customers consume our EndoWrist instruments and accessory products for use in performing procedures with the da Vinci Surgical System. EndoWrist instruments and accessories have a limited life and will either expire or wear out as they are used in surgery, at which point they are replaced. We also generate recurring revenue from ongoing system service. We typically enter into service contracts at the time the system is sold. These service contracts have been generally renewable at the end of the service period, typically at an annual rate of approximately $100,000 to $170,000 per year, depending on the configuration of the underlying system. Recurring revenue has generally grown at a faster rate than system revenue. Recurring revenue increased from $419.6 million, or 48% of total revenue in 2008, to $561.7 million, or 53% of total revenue in 2009 to $752.7 million, or 53% of total revenue in 2010. The increase in recurring revenue relative to system revenue reflects continuing adoption of procedures on a growing base of installed da Vinci Surgical Systems. We expect recurring revenue to become a larger percentage of total revenue in the future. The installed base of da Vinci Surgical Systems has grown to 1,752 at December 31, 2010, compared with 1,395 at December 31, 2009 and 1,111 at December 31, 2008. Regulatory Activities We believe that we have obtained the necessary clearances to market our products to our targeted surgical specialties within the United States. As we make additions to target procedures, we will continue to seek the necessary clearances. The following table lists chronologically our FDA clearances to date: July 2000 General laparoscopic procedures March 2001 Non cardiac thoracoscopic procedures May 2001 Prostatectomy procedures November 2002 Cardiotomy procedures July 2004 Cardiac revascularization procedures March 2005 Urologic surgical procedures April 2005 Gynecologic surgical procedures June 2005 Pediatric surgical procedures December 2009 Transoral Otolaryngologic surgical procedures During first quarter of 2009, we received clearances to market our da Vinci Si Surgical System in the United States and Europe. In November 2009, we received regulatory (Shonin) approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (MHLW) for our da Vinci S System in Japan. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we sold 13 da Vinci S Systems in Japan. These sales were primarily made to early adopters. We are currently focusing our 41 Table of Contents efforts with Johnson & Johnson K.K. Medical Company (Japan) on obtaining specific reimbursement approvals for da Vinci procedures in Japan. If we are not successful in obtaining system wide single procedure reimbursements or obtaining approvals for future products and procedures, then the demand of our products could be limited. We have partnered with the experienced regulatory team from Johnson & Johnson K.K. Medical Company (Japan) in our Japanese regulatory process and are continuing to work with them to meet government requirements. We have partnered with Adachi Co., LTD as our separate independent distribution partner in Japan who is responsible for marketing, selling, and servicing our products in Japan. 2010 Business Events and Trends Economic Environment. During the first half of 2009, the world wide economic recession curtailed capital purchases of our da Vinci Surgical Systems. The 441 total da Vinci Surgical Systems sold in the year ended December 31, 2010 exceeded those sold during the same period of 2009 by 103 systems. da Vinci Si Surgical System Product Launch. During the second quarter of 2009 we launched our newest da Vinci model, the da Vinci Si. The da Vinci Si brings to market three significant innovations. First, our InSite imaging system has been substantially redesigned for increased visual acuity and improved ease of use. The HD imaging systems increased performance is similar to the move from 720p to 1080i in commercial television. We believe that the increased visual performance will continue to enhance surgeon precision and confidence and may contribute to improved patient outcomes and shorter procedure times. Secondly, the da Vinci Si surgeon consoles user interface was redesigned to allow simplified and integrated control of da Vinci products and other operating room devices, such as electro surgical units. The new user interface also includes a set of ergonomic controls for surgeon comfort. We believe the simplified interface will allow for easier surgeon training. The third significant improvement is the introduction of a dual surgeons console for use during surgery, which will allow new methods of training da Vinci surgeons and enable collaborative da Vinci surgery. With the da Vinci Si, a surgeon sitting at a second console can view the same surgery as the primary surgeon and can be passed control of some or all of the da Vinci arms during a case. We believe this will both shorten the learning curve for new surgeons and will allow collaborative surgery in complex cases. The da Vinci Si Surgical System was FDA approved and CE marked upon launch and is currently available in most countries other than Japan. da Vinci Si Systems are available with an option to purchase a second console. Existing da Vinci S instruments and most da Vinci S accessories, excluding endoscopes and drapes, are compatible with the da Vinci Si system. We will continue to sell, service and support the da Vinci S Surgical System. Our sales of the standard da Vinci Surgical System have substantially ended; however, we continue to service and support this product line. Most customers who purchased da Vinci S Surgical Systems in the first quarter of 2009 were offered the opportunity to upgrade their recently purchased da Vinci S Surgical Systems to da Vinci Si Surgical Systems at a discount to the list price of our upgrade. The upgrade program also provided our customers the opportunity to return their recently purchased da Vinci S camera accessories and receive a credit towards the purchase of da Vinci Si camera or other accessories. These customers were given until June 30, 2009 to accept our offer. Total revenue in an amount equal to the discount, of approximately $20.1 million, was deferred in the first quarter of 2009. During the second quarter of 2009, we recognized $13.8 million of revenue from offers declined, upgrades completed or accessories delivered. In the third quarter of 2009, we completed all accepted da Vinci Si system upgrade offers and recognized the remaining $6.3 million of deferred revenue. The deferral and subsequent recognition did not impact the comparability of the results for the year ended 2010 to any other year. Market acceptance of the da Vinci Si Surgical System has been positive since its market introduction in the second quarter of 2009. In the year ended December 31, 2010, 372 out of 441 systems sold were da Vinci Si Surgical Systems, representing approximately 84% of system sales. 42 Table of Contents In the third quarter of 2010, we introduced the new Si e model of the da Vinci Surgical System. The 3 arm Si e System is designed to deliver core da Vinci functionality, providing a flexible, capable and economical solution for many robotic assisted procedures. The da Vinci Si e system is fully upgradeable to the da Vinci Si model by adding a fourth arm (third instrument arm), and other enhancements. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we sold 9 da Vinci Si e systems. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we introduced the da Vinci Skills Simulator. The simulator is a practice tool which will begin shipping in early 2011 for the da Vinci Si Surgical System that gives a user the opportunity to practice his or her facility with the surgeon console controls. The simulator incorporates three dimensional, physics based computer simulation technology to immerse the user within a virtual environment. The user navigates through the environment and completes exercises by controlling virtual instruments from the surgeon console. The suite of exercises includes novice, intermediate, and advanced levels. Upon completion of a skills exercise, the simulator provides a quantitative assessment of user performance based on a variety of task specific metrics. The Skills Simulator is intended to augment, not replace, existing training programs for the da Vinci Si Surgical System. 2010 Financial Highlights Total revenue increased to $1,413.0 million, or 34%, during the year ended December 31, 2010 from $1,052.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. Approximately 278,000 da Vinci procedures were performed during the year ended December 31, 2010, up approximately 35% from last year. Instruments and accessories revenue increased to $528.8 million or 36% during the year ended December 31, 2010 from $389.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. Recurring revenue increased to $752.7 million, or 34% during the year ended December 31, 2010, representing 53% of total revenue from $561.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, representing 53% of total revenue. We sold 441 da Vinci Surgical Systems during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared with 338 for the year ended December 31, 2009. System revenue increased to $660.3 million, or 35% during the year ended December 31, 2010 from $490.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2010, we had a da Vinci Surgical System installed base of 1,752 systems, 1,285 in the United States, 316 in Europe, and 151 in the rest of the world. Operating income increased to $555.2 million, or 47% during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $377.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. Operating income included $117.6 million and $97.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, of stock based compensation expense related to employee stock programs. We ended fiscal 2010 with $1,608.9 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments increased by $436.9 million during 2010 driven by cash flow from operations and $141.1 million generated from employee stock programs, partially offset by $198.6 million used to repurchase and retire 0.7 million shares of common stock, and $96.0 million used for capital expenditure and the purchase of intellectual property. Procedure adoption We believe the adoption of da Vinci surgery occurs surgical procedure by surgical procedure, and it is being adopted for those procedures which offer greater patient value than non da Vinci alternatives . We believe the value of a surgical procedure to a patient is higher if it offers superior clinical outcomes, less surgical trauma, or both. 43 Table of Contents An increasing body of peer review literature has indicated that dVP offers improved functional outcomes compared to traditional open prostatectomy with less surgical and post surgical morbidity. Favorable clinical outcomes have also been reported in hysterectomies for cancerous pathology, which include increased lymph node retrieval counts and significant reduction in blood transfusion. For most patients, a minimally invasive approach using the da Vinci Surgical System offers reduced pain, less blood loss, shorter hospital stays, reduced post operative complications and a quicker return to normal daily activities when compared to open surgery. In 2010, approximately 278,000 surgical procedures were performed with the da Vinci Surgical System, up approximately 35% compared to 2009. The growth in our overall procedure volume was driven primarily by: da Vinci Hysterectomy (dVH) in the U.S., da Vinci Prostatectomy (dVP) outside the U.S. and pull through procedures in the Urology and Gynecology categories (Nephrectomy (partial and full), Sacralcolpopexy, Myomectomy, Cystectomy, Pyeloplasty) in the U.S. During 2010, dVH became our highest volume procedure, surpassing dVP. dVH procedure volume grew from approximately 69,000 cases in 2009 to approximately 110,000 cases in 2010, of which approximately 32,000 were for the treatment of cancer and the remaining 78,000 related to benign conditions. The very large majority of our 2010 dVH volume came from the US market, where we estimate the total annual addressable robotic market to be approximately 300,000 to 350,000 cases, of which about 50,000 are for cancer. dVP procedure volume grew from approximately 90,000 cases in 2009 to approximately 98,000 cases worldwide, in 2010. The large majority of the approximately 85,000 prostatectomies performed each year in the US are done robotically with the da Vinci. 2010 US dVP volume was essentially flat, with the majority of our 2010 worldwide dVP growth coming from European markets. Other procedures (non dVH/dVP) grew over 50% in 2010 to approximately 70,000 cases. Growth in these other da Vinci procedures is comprised of pull through procedures such as da Vinci Partial Nephrectomy in Urology and da Vinci Sacralcopopexy in Gynecology as well as other procedures, which we term emerging procedures. Emerging procedures are earlier in their development, such as da Vinci Transoral Robotic Surgery (TORS) in head and neck surgery. While early results in emerging procedures are encouraging and may point to significant patient value, their growth is off of a small absolute base and their future growth rates are uncertain. Technology Acquisitions We continue to make several strategic acquisitions of intellectual property and related technologies. Total investments in intellectual property and related technologies during the year ended December 31, 2010 were $38.2 million, compared to $25.7 during the year ended December 31, 2009. Amortization expense related to purchased intellectual property for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $16.3 million and $15.1 million, respectively. Building Acquisition During the third quarter of 2010, we entered into an agreement to purchase 17.7 acres of land and buildings for $33.0 million in Sunnyvale, California by June 2011. This property is in close proximity to our existing headquarters. Although we entered into the agreement to support the potential growth of our business there is no guarantee that the planned growth and expansion will take place in the timeframe we expected, or at all. 44 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the years indicated, certain Consolidated Statements of Income information (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2010 % of totalrevenue 2009 % of totalrevenue 2008 % of totalrevenue Revenue: Product $ 1,189.1 84 % $ 879.9 84 % $ 748.3 86 % Service 223.9 16 % 172.3 16 % 126.6 14 % Total revenue 1,413.0 100 % 1,052.2 100 % 874.9 100 % Cost of revenue: Product 297.3 21 % 237.6 23 % 200.1 23 % Service 85.7 6 % 63.5 6 % 54.0 6 % Total cost of revenue 383.0 27 % 301.1 29 % 254.1 29 % Product gross profit 891.8 63 % 642.3 61 % 548.2 63 % Service gross profit 138.2 10 % 108.8 10 % 72.6 8 % Gross profit 1,030.0 73 % 751.1 71 % 620.8 71 % Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative 358.8 25 % 278.6 26 % 230.6 26 % Research and development 116.0 8 % 95.1 9 % 79.4 9 % Total operating expenses 474.8 33 % 373.7 35 % 310.0 35 % Income from operations 555.2 40 % 377.4 36 % 310.8 36 % Interest and other income, net 17.1 1 % 18.7 2 % 24.4 2 % Income before income taxes 572.3 41 % 396.1 38 % 335.2 38 % Income tax expense 190.5 14 % 163.5 16 % 130.9 15 % Net income $ 381.8 27 % $ 232.6 22 % $ 204.3 23 % Total Revenue Total revenue increased by 34% and 20% during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Total revenue increased to $1,413.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 from $1,052.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2009 from $874.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. Total revenue growth was driven by the continued adoption of da Vinci surgery. We believe that robotic surgery will be adopted surgical procedure by surgical procedure, driving higher system and recurring revenue. Our revenue growth during the periods presented reflects penetration in our target procedures. dVH and dVP are our two largest procedures, representing more than 70% of our total procedures over the past several years. Revenue within the United States accounted for 80%, 79%, and 78% of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. We believe domestic revenue has accounted for the large majority of total revenue primarily due to the ability of patients to choose their provider and method of treatment in the U.S. 45 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our revenue and da Vinci Surgical System unit sales for the years indicated (in millions, except unit sales and percentages): Year Ended December 31, Revenue 2010 2009 2008 Instruments and accessories $ 528.8 $ 389.4 $ 293.0 Systems 660.3 490.5 455.3 Total product revenue 1,189.1 879.9 748.3 Services 223.9 172.3 126.6 Total revenue $ 1,413.0 $ 1,052.2 $ 874.9 Recurring revenue $ 752.7 $ 561.7 $ 419.6 % of total revenue 53 % 53 % 48 % Revenue Domestic $ 1,126.0 $ 827.0 $ 679.7 Revenue International 287.0 225.2 195.2 Total revenue $ 1,413.0 $ 1,052.2 $ 874.9 Domestic Unit Sales 335 252 246 International Unit Sales 106 86 89 Total Unit Sales 441 338 335 Product Revenue Product revenue increased to $1,189.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 from $879.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. Instruments and accessories revenue increased to $528.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, up 36% compared with $389.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in revenue was driven by an increase in procedures performed and, to a lesser extent, higher initial instrument and accessory stocking orders associated with higher 2010 system unit sales. Procedure growth occurred in all of our targeted procedures with dVH and dVP being the largest drivers of growth. Utilization per installed system for the year ended December 31, 2010 also increased as compared with the year ended December 31, 2009. Instrument and accessory list pricing remained unchanged from 2009 to 2010. Systems revenue increased to $660.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, up 35% from $490.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to 103 more systems sold in 2010. We sold 441 da Vinci Surgical Systems during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared with 338 in the year ended December 31, 2009. 372 of the 441 systems sold during the year ended December 31, 2010 were the da Vinci Si Surgical Systems, of which 68 systems were dual console configurations. We had 75 da Vinci standard and 9 da Vinci S Surgical Systems traded in during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared with 54 standard systems traded in during the year ended December 31, 2009. All 9 of the 2010 da Vinci S trade ins occurred during the fourth quarter. Prior to the fourth quarter 2010, transactions involving customers transitioning from da Vinci S to a da Vinci Si system were included in upgrade revenue and excluded from the system count. The fourth quarter 2010 treatment reflects the current nature of the higher priced transactions where customers are now shipped completely new da Vinci Si systems in exchange for their used da Vinci Ss, rather than receiving component level field upgrades of their da Vinci S units. The 2010 average selling price (ASP) of $1.44 million was higher than the 2009 ASP of $1.39 million, resulting from a higher percentage of the higher priced single and dual console da Vinci Si Surgical Systems in the systems product mix. System upgrade revenue was $25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $19.1 million for the year ended 2009. 46 Table of Contents Product revenue increased to $879.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2009 from $748.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. Instruments and accessories revenue increased to $389.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, up 33%, compared with $293.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in revenue was driven by an increase in procedures performed. Procedure growth occurred in all of our targeted procedures with dVH and dVP being the largest drivers of growth. Utilization per installed system for the year ended December 31, 2009 also increased as compared with the year ended December 31, 2008. Instrument and accessory list pricing remained unchanged from 2008 to 2009. Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure declined approximately 12% during 2009 primarily due to the impact of initial stocking orders. The amount of revenue related to stocking orders is less impactful as the base of installed systems grows. In addition, we believe our customers are becoming more efficient in their use of instruments and accessories as their procedure volumes increase. We expect these factors to continue to cause a decrease in our ratio of instrument and accessory revenue per procedure in the future. Systems revenue increased to $490.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, up 8% from $455.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to more 2009 system upgrade revenue, higher 2009 ASP, and 3 more systems sold. System upgrade revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased to $19.2 million compared to $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, driven by the impact of 2009 da Vinci Si system upgrades. The 2009 ASP of $1.39 million was higher than the 2008 ASP of $1.34 million, primarily associated with the introduction of the da Vinci Si systems. We sold 338 da Vinci Surgical Systems during 2009, compared with 335 systems sold during 2008. 209 of 338 systems sold during 2009 were da Vinci Si Systems. Service Revenue Service revenue, comprised primarily of system service and customer training, increased 30% to $223.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $172.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. We typically enter into service contracts at the time systems are sold. These service contracts have been generally renewed at the end of the service period. Higher service revenue for 2010 was driven by a larger base of da Vinci Surgical Systems producing contract service revenue. Service revenue increased to $172.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, up 36% from $126.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Higher service revenue for 2009 was driven by a larger base of da Vinci Surgical Systems and higher priced da Vinci Si service contract billings. The average service revenue per system was approximately $143,000 during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared with $139,000 during the year ended December 31, 2008, increasing primarily due to the slightly higher da Vinci Si contract rates. Gross Profit Product gross profit during the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 39% to $891.8 million, or 75.0% of product revenue, compared to $642.3 million, or 73.0% of product revenue, during the year ended December 31, 2009. The higher product gross profit was driven by higher 2010 product revenue, as described above. The higher product gross profit percentage was driven by higher 2010 system ASPs, system and instrument material cost reductions, lower 2010 charges for excess and obsolete inventory, and leveraging manufacturing overhead across higher revenue. Product gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 reflected stock based compensation expense of $9.6 million and $7.7 million, respectively. Product gross profit during the year ended December 31, 2009 was $642.3 million, or 73.0% of product revenue, compared to $548.3 million, or 73.3% of product revenue, during the year ended December 31, 2008. The higher 2009 product gross profit was driven by the higher 2009 product revenue, as described above. The slightly lower 2009 product gross profit percentage was driven by lower margins associated with the launch of da Vinci Si. Product gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 reflected stock based compensation expense of $7.7 million and $6.3 million, respectively. 47 Table of Contents Service gross profit during the year ended December 31, 2010 increased to $138.2 million, or 61.8% of service revenue, compared to $108.8 million, or 63.1% of service revenue during the year ended December 31, 2009. The higher 2010 service gross profit was driven by a larger installed base. The lower 2010 gross service profit percentage was primarily driven by higher 2010 field upgrade costs. Service gross profit during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 reflected stock based compensation expense of $8.4 million and $6.6 million, respectively. Service gross profit during the year ended December 31, 2009 was $108.8 million, or 63.1% of service revenue, compared to $72.5 million, or 57.3% of service revenue during the year ended December 31, 2008. The higher 2009 service gross profit was driven by a larger installed base. The higher 2009 gross service profit percentage was driven by leveraging service costs across a larger base of installed systems and lower service parts consumption and repair costs per system due to product quality and productivity gains. Service gross profit during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 reflected stock based compensation expense of $6.6 million and $5.1 million, respectively. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses include costs for sales, marketing and administrative personnel, sales and marketing activities, tradeshow expenses, legal expenses, regulatory fees and general corporate expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 29% to $358.8 million compared to $278.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increases were due to organizational growth to support our expanding business, particularly in the expansion of our clinical sales force, where headcount increased from 309 at December 31, 2009 to 467 at December 31, 2010, higher commissions related to higher revenue levels, and increased stock based compensation. Stock based compensation expense charged to sales, general and administrative expenses during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $77.0 million and $61.3 million, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 21% to $278.6 million compared to $230.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase is due to organizational growth to support our expanding business, particularly in U.S. field sales, higher commissions and other variable compensation related to higher revenue levels, and increased stock based compensation. Stock based compensation expense charged to sales, general and administrative expenses during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $61.3 million and $48.1 million, respectively. Research and Development Expenses Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses include costs associated with the design, development, testing and significant enhancement of our products. These enhancements represent significant improvements to our products. Research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 22% to $116.0 million compared to $95.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase is due to the growth in our research and development organization, and higher product prototype expenses. Amortization expense related to purchased intellectual property during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $14.4 million. Stock based compensation expense charged to research and development expense during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $22.6 million and $21.4 million, respectively. We expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development and anticipate that research and development expenses, including the co development arrangement with industry partners, will continue to increase in the future. 48 Table of Contents Research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 20% to $95.1 million compared to $79.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase is due to the growth in our research and development organization, higher product prototype expenses, higher amortization expenses of purchased intellectual property, and higher stock based compensation expense. Amortization expenses related to purchased intellectual property during the year ended December 31, 2009 was $14.4 million, compared to $9.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. Stock based compensation expense charged to research and development expense during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $21.4 million and $17.1 million, respectively. Interest and Other Income, Net Interest and other income, net, was $17.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Lower interest and other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2010 was driven by lower interest rates earned on cash and investment balances in 2010, partially offset by fluctuations in foreign exchange gains and losses. Interest and other income, net, was $18.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $24.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decline of $5.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2009 was primarily due to lower interest rates earned on cash and investment balances in 2009. Income Tax Expense Our income tax expense was $190.5 million, $163.5 million, and $130.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2010 was approximately 33.3%, which differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to state income taxes net of federal benefit and non deductible stock option compensation, offset by 2010 research and development (R&D) credit, and by the effect of income earned by certain of our foreign subsidiaries being taxed at rates lower than the federal statutory rate. We intend these foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. The effective tax rate for 2009 was approximately 41.3%, which differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to state income taxes net of federal benefit and non deductible stock option compensation, partially offset by R&D credit and domestic production deductions generated in 2009. The effective tax rate for 2008 was approximately 39.0%, which differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to state income taxes net of federal benefit and non deductible stock option compensation, partially offset by R&D credit and domestic production deductions generated in 2008. The lower effective tax rate in 2010 as compared to 2009 and 2008 is due primarily to an increase in foreign earnings on which U.S. income taxes have not been provided as such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. In December 2010, a retroactive two year extension of federal R&D credit through the end of year 2011 was signed into law. The federal R&D credit has previously expired at the end of year 2009. As a result of this change in federal tax law, we recorded a federal R&D credit benefit of $4.6 million for the full year 2010 discretely in the fourth quarter of 2010. A California tax law change enacted in February 2009 allows an elective single sales factor for state apportionment for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2011. We expect to benefit from the California single sales factor election for apportioning income for years 2011 and beyond. As a result of our anticipated election of the single sales factor, in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, we have re measured our deferred tax assets in the first quarter of 2009, taking into account the reversal pattern and the expected California tax rate under the elective single sales factor. 49 Table of Contents Liquidity And Capital Resources Sources and Uses of Cash Cash generation is one of the fundamental strengths of our business model and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting our operating, investing and financing needs. Our principal source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and the exercise of stock options. Cash and cash equivalents plus short and long term investments increased from $901.9 million at December 31, 2008, to $1,172.0 million at December 31, 2009, to $1,608.9 million at December 31, 2010. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for discussion on impact of interest rate risk and market risk on our investment portfolio. Consolidated Cash Flow Data Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) Net cash provided by (used in) Operating activities $ 528.0 $ 385.1 $ 278.2 Investing activities (476.5 ) (292.4 ) (304.5 ) Financing activities 7.7 (66.2 ) 98.0 Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (0.8 ) 0.3 0.1 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 58.4 $ 26.8 $ 71.8 Operating Activities During the year ended December 31, 2010, cash flow from operations of $528.0 million exceeded our net income of $381.8 million for two primary reasons: 1) Our net income included substantial non cash charges in the form of stock based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, taxes and depreciation. These non cash charges totaled $129.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. 2) Cash provided by working capital during the year ended December 31, 2010 was approximately $17.0 million. Working capital is comprised primarily of accounts receivable, inventory, deferred revenue and other liabilities. Inventory increased by $29.2 million or 51% in 2010. The growth in inventory reflects increased revenue, increases to ensure adequate supply of key components as December 31st quantities were below optimal levels and inventory associated with new product introductions. Deferred revenue, which includes deferred service contract revenue that is being amortized over the service contract period, increased $26.5 million or 26% in 2010 related to the increase in the number of installed systems for which service contracts exist. Other liabilities including accounts payable, accrued compensation and employee benefits, and accrued liabilities increased $60.1 million or 35% in 2010, primarily due to timing of vendor and tax payments and employee compensation during 2010. During the year ended December 31, 2009, cash flow from operations of $385.1 million exceeded our net income of $232.6 million for two primary reasons: 1) Our net income included substantial non cash charges in the form of stock based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, taxes and depreciation. These non cash charges totaled $114.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. 2) Cash provided by working capital and other assets during the year ended December 31, 2009 was approximately $38.0 million. 50 Table of Contents Working capital is comprised primarily of accounts receivable, deferred revenue and other liabilities. Accounts receivable increased $35.3 million or 21% in 2009, primarily reflecting increased revenue. Deferred revenue, which includes deferred service contract revenue that is being amortized over the service contract period, increased $21.3 million or 27% in 2009, which is primarily related to the increase in the number of installed systems for which service contracts exist. Other liabilities including accounts payable, accrued compensation and employee benefits, and accrued liabilities increased $52.4 million or 41% in 2009, reflecting changes in the volume of our business and timing of vendor payments and increase in unrecognized tax benefits. During the year ended December 31, 2008, cash flow from operations of $278.2 million exceeded our net income of $204.3 million for two primary reasons: 1) Our net income included substantial non cash charges in the form of stock based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, taxes and depreciation. These non cash charges totaled $83.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. 2) We experienced rapid growth in our business with revenues increasing 46% during the year ended December 31, 2008. Our net investment in working capital and other operating assets totaled $9.9 million. Working capital is comprised primarily of accounts receivable, inventory, deferred revenue and other current liabilities. Accounts receivable increased $39.7 million or 30% in 2008, primarily reflecting increased revenue. Inventory increased $31.1 million or 96% in 2008 primarily due to lower than expected system revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Deferred revenue, which includes deferred service contract revenue that is being amortized over the service contract period, increased $24.6 million or 45% in 2008, which is primarily related to the increase in the number of installed systems for which service contracts exist. Other liabilities including accounts payable, accrued compensation and employee benefits, and accrued liabilities increased $32.4 million or 34% in 2008, reflecting changes in the volume of our business, timing of vendor payments and increase in unrecognized tax benefits. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 consisted primarily of purchases of investments (net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments) of $380.5 million, $239.0 million and $198.5 million, respectively, and purchases of property and equipment and licensing of intellectual property of $96.0 million, $53.4 million and $106.0 million, respectively. We invest predominantly in high quality, fixed income securities. Our investment portfolio may at any time contain investments in U.S Treasury and U.S. government agency securities, taxable and or tax exempt municipal notes (some of which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, cash deposits and money market funds. We are not a capital intensive business. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities in 2010 consisted primarily of proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $141.1 million and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation of $65.2 million, offset by $198.6 million for the repurchase of approximately 0.7 million shares of our common stock through open market transactions. Net cash used in financing activities in 2009 consisted primarily of $150.0 million used for the repurchase of 1.4 million shares of our common stock through an accelerated repurchase program, offset by proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $58.7 million, and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation of $25.1 million. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2008 consisted primarily of proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $44.7 million and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation of $53.3 million. Our cash requirements depend on numerous factors, including market acceptance of our products, the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products and other factors. We expect to continue to 51 Table of Contents devote substantial resources to expand procedure adoption and acceptance of our products investments. In 2010, we made substantial investments in our sales force, product development activities, facilities and intellectual property. Based upon our business model, we anticipate that we will continue to be able to fund future growth through cash provided from operations. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, together with income to be derived from the sale of our products, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010 (in millions): Payments due by period Total Less than 1year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years More than 5years Operating leases $ 4.8 $ 2.1 $ 1.9 $ 0.5 $ 0.3 Purchase commitments and obligations 212.2 210.8 1.4 Total contractual obligations $ 217.0 $ 212.9 $ 3.3 $ 0.5 $ 0.3 Operating leases. We lease office spaces in the United States, Switzerland, Mexico, Japan and China. We also lease automobiles for certain sales and field service employees. Operating lease amounts include future minimum lease payments under all our non cancelable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year. Purchase commitments and obligations. These amounts include an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, including commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services, acquisition and licensing of intellectual property and commitment to purchase land and buildings in Sunnyvale, California. A majority of these purchase obligations are due within a year. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services. In addition to the above, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing, collaboration and development arrangements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and have not been included in the table above. Other commitments. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when payments may occur for our unrecognized tax benefits. Therefore, our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2010, we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K promulgated under the Exchange Act. Critical Accounting Estimates Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions. Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, describes our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting estimates include: the valuation and recognition of investments, which impacts our investment portfolio balance when we assess fair value, and interest and other income, net, when we record impairments; 52 Table of Contents the valuation of revenue and allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts, which impacts revenue; the estimation of transactions to hedge, which impacts revenue and other expense; the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margins; the assessment of recoverability of intangibles and the estimated useful lives, which primarily impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their amortization; the valuation and recognition of share based compensation, which impacts gross margin and operating expenses; and the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes. Investments in Debt Securities Fair Value Our investment portfolio may at any time contain investments in U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities, taxable and or tax exempt municipal notes (some of which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, cash deposits and money market funds. In the current market environment, the assessment of the fair value of the debt securities can be difficult and subjective. U.S. GAAP establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value (see Note 4. Fair Value Measurements in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K). Each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value. Valuation of Level 1 and 2 instruments generally do not require significant management judgment and the estimation is not difficult. Level 3 instruments include unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The determination of fair value for Level 3 instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity. All of the securities classified as Level 3 instruments are municipal bonds with an auction reset feature (auction rate securities or ARS) whose underlying assets are student loans which are substantially backed by the federal government. These ARS securities represent approximately 1% of our total investment portfolio as of December 31, 2010. Since the auctions for these securities have continued to fail since February 2008, these investments are not currently trading and therefore do not have a readily determinable market value. Accordingly, the estimated fair value of the ARS no longer approximates par value. On June 30, 2010, pursuant to the terms of the UBS rights offering, we exercised our right to sell all ARS subject to the rights offering to UBS at the par value of $34.4 million. As a result on July 1, 2010, we received the full par value in cash from UBS. The remainder of the ARS investment portfolio (approximately $22.6 million, par value) is classified as available for sales securities. Accordingly, the change in associated market value has been recorded against other comprehensive income during the year ended December 31, 2010. If market conditions deteriorate further, we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in other comprehensive income or impairment charges. We may not be able to liquidate these investments unless the issuer calls the security, a successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the auction process, or the security matures. Other than temporary impairment After determining the fair value of our available for sales debt instruments, gains or losses on these securities are recorded to other comprehensive income, until either the security is sold or we determine that the decline in value is other than temporary. The primary differentiating factors considered by us to classify its impairments between temporary and other than temporary impairments are our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, the length of the time and the extent to which the market value of the investment has been less than cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer. Given the current market conditions, these judgments could prove to be wrong, and companies with relatively high credit ratings and solid financial conditions may not be able to fulfill their obligations. 53 Table of Contents No impairment charges were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, our cumulative unrealized gains related to our investments classified as available for sale was approximately $1.3 million and $0.9 million, respectively. Allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts. We record estimated reductions in revenue for potential returns of products by customers and other allowances. As a result, management must make estimates of potential future product returns and other allowances related to current period product revenue. In making such estimates, management analyzes historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products. If management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates, material differences in the amount of reported revenue could result. Similarly, management makes estimates of the uncollectibility of accounts receivables, especially analyzing accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms, when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Credit evaluations are undertaken for all major sale transactions before shipment is authorized. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate aged items in the accounts receivable aging report and provide allowance in an amount we deem adequate for doubtful accounts. If management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates, material differences in the amount of our reported operating expenses could result. Inventory valuation. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first in, first out basis. The carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand. We evaluate the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Intangible Assets. Our intangible assets include identifiable intangibles and goodwill. Identifiable intangibles include developed technology, patents, and licenses. All of our identifiable intangibles have finite lives. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to an annual impairment review (or more frequent if impairment indicators arise) by applying a fair value based test. There have been no impairments from the analysis required by U.S. GAAP. Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are subject to impairment testing and are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that such assets may not be recoverable at their carrying value. We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of these identifiable intangibles based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from such assets. If the cash flow estimates or the significant operating assumptions upon which they are based change in the future, we may be required to record additional impairment charges. When events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable, we recognize such impairment in the event the net book value of such assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets. We have intangible assets and goodwill on our balance sheet. The valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful amortization lives involves judgments and the use of estimates. The evaluation of these intangibles and goodwill for impairment under established accounting guidelines is required on a recurring basis. Changes in business conditions could potentially require future adjustments to asset valuations. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of 54 Table of Contents amortization over the assets new, shorter useful lives. We conducted the required intangible assets impairment review during the fourth quarter of 2010. No impairment charge or material accelerated amortization was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing impairment, which includes financial forecasts. Should conditions be different from managements current estimates, material write downs of long lived assets may be required, which would adversely affect our operating results. Revenue recognition. We frequently enter into revenue arrangements that contain multiple elements or deliverables such as system and services. Judgments as to the allocation of the proceeds received from an arrangement to the multiple elements of the arrangement, the determination of whether any undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are critical in respect to these arrangements to ensure compliance with U.S. GAAP. Changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition. Revenue recognition also depends on the timing of shipment and is subject to customer acceptance. If shipments are not made on scheduled timelines or if the products are not accepted by the customer in a timely manner, our reported revenues may differ materially from expectations. In September 2009, the FASB amended the accounting standards related to revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables and arrangements that include software elements (new accounting principles). The new accounting principles permit prospective or retrospective adoption, and we elected prospective adoption at the beginning of the first quarter of 2010. These new accounting principles do not generally change the units of accounting for our revenue transactions and we continue to have system and service as the different elements in our multiple element arrangements. For multiple element arrangements entered into on or after January 1, 2010, we allocate revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. Because we have neither vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) nor third party evidence of selling price ( TPE) for our systems, the allocation of revenue has been based on estimated selling prices (ESPs). The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product was sold on a stand alone basis. We determine ESP for our systems by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, features and functionality of the system, geographies, type of customer and market conditions. We expect to review ESP regularly and maintain internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates. We do not expect material changes to ESPs established as of January 1, 2010 in future periods. However, since we apply significant judgment in arriving at the ESPs, any material changes would significantly affect the allocation of the total consideration to the different elements of a multiple element arrangement. Hedge Accounting for Derivatives. We utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency sales transactions. When specific criteria required by relevant accounting standards have been met, changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI) rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When we determine that the transactions are no longer probable within a certain time frame, we are required to reclassify the cumulative changes in the fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to net income. Accounting for stock options. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of U.S. GAAP. We use the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions. These assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them, the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements. The assumptions for expected volatility and expected term are the two assumptions that significantly affect the grant date fair value. Changes in expected risk free rate of return do not significantly impact the calculation of fair value, and determining this input is not highly subjective. 55 Table of Contents We use implied volatility based on freely traded options in the open market, as we believe implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility. In determining the appropriateness of implied volatility, we considered the following: the volume of market activity of freely traded options, and determined that there was sufficient market activity; the ability to reasonably match the input variables of freely traded options to those options granted, such as the date of the grant and the exercise price, and determined that the input assumptions were comparable; and the term of freely traded options used to derive implied volatility, which is generally at least one year, and determined that the length of term was sufficient. The expected term represents the weighted average period that our stock options are expected to be outstanding. The expected term is based on the observed and expected time to post vesting exercise of options by employees. We use historical exercise patterns of previously granted options in relation to stock price movements to derive an employee behavioral pattern used to forecast expected exercise patterns. U.S. GAAP requires us to develop an estimate of the number of share based awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover. Adjustments in the estimated forfeiture rates can have a significant effect on our reported share based compensation, as we recognize the cumulative effect of the rate adjustments for all expense amortization in the period the estimated forfeiture rates were adjusted. We estimate and adjust forfeiture rates based on a periodic review of recent forfeiture activity and expected future employee turnover. If a revised forfeiture rate is higher than previously estimated forfeiture rate, we may make an adjustment that will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements during the period when the rate was changed. Adjustments in the estimated forfeiture rates could also cause changes in the amount of expense that we recognize in future periods. Changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and, consequently, the related amount recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Accounting for income taxes. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in the current or subsequent period. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is less than a 50% likelihood, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover substantially all of the deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2010. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which such change takes place. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, then the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain 56 Table of Contents tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effective settlement of audit issues, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.
