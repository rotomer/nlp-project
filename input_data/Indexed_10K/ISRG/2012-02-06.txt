ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Open surgery remains the predominant form of surgery and is used in almost every area of the body. However, the large incisions required for open surgery create trauma to the patient, resulting in longer hospitalization and recovery times, increased hospitalization costs and additional pain and suffering relative to minimally invasive surgery (MIS) where MIS is available. Over the past two decades, MIS has reduced trauma to the patient by allowing selected surgeries to be performed through small ports rather than large incisions, often resulting in shorter recovery times, fewer complications and reduced hospitalization costs. MIS has been widely adopted for certain surgical procedures, but it has not been widely adopted for complex reconstructive surgeries. The da Vinci Surgical System enables surgeons to extend the benefits of MIS to many patients typically receiving open surgery by using computational, robotic and imaging technologies to overcome many of the limitations of conventional minimally invasive surgery. Surgeons operate while seated comfortably at a console viewing a high resolution, 3 D, HD image of the surgical field. This immersive visualization connects the surgeon to the surgical field and their instruments. While seated at the console, the surgeon manipulates instrument controls in a natural manner, similar to the way he or she has been trained to do in open surgery. Our technology is designed to provide surgeons with a range of motion in the surgical field analogous to the motions of a human wrist, while filtering out the tremor inherent in a surgeons hand. In designing our products, we focus on making our technology easy to use. 38 Table of Contents Our products fall into four broad categories da Vinci Surgical Systems, InSite and Firefly Fluorescence imaging systems, instruments and accessories (e.g., EndoWrist, EndoWrist One, Single Site) and training technologies. We have commercialized three generations of da Vinci Surgical Systems; the first is our da Vinci standard Surgical System, first commercialized in 1999, the second is our da Vinci S Surgical System, commercialized in 2006 and the third is our most current surgical system, da Vinci Si, commercialized in 2009. Systems include a surgeons console, imaging electronics, a patient size cart and computational hardware and software. Instruments and accessories are used with systems to allow surgeons flexibility in choosing the types of tools needed in a particular surgery. Lastly, training technologies include our recently developed da Vinci Skills Simulator and our dual console for use in surgeon proctoring and collaborative surgery. We model patient value as equal to procedure efficacy / invasiveness. Here procedure efficacy is a measure of the success of the surgery in resolving the underlying disease and invasiveness is how disruptive and painful the treatment is itself. When the patient value of robotic surgery is significantly higher than competing treatment options, we have seen that patients will seek out surgeons and hospitals that offer da Vinci procedures. Market adoption occurs procedure by procedure, and is driven by the relative patient value of da Vinci procedures compared to alternatives for the same disease state. Procedures The adoption of da Vinci surgery has the potential to progress for those procedures that offer greater patient value than non da Vinci alternatives. We focus our organization and investments on developing, marketing and training those products and procedures where we believe da Vinci can bring significant patient value relative to competitive therapies. In 2011, da Vinci was used primarily in urology, gynecology, general surgery, cardiothoracic surgery and head and neck surgery. Target procedures in urology include da Vinci Prostatectomy (dVP) and da Vinci Partial Nephrectomy. Target procedures in gynecology include da Vinci Hysterectomy (dVH), da Vinci Myomectomy and da Vinci Sacral Colpopexy. Target procedures in general surgery include da Vinci Colon Resection. In cardiothoracic surgery, they include da Vinci Lobectomy and da Vinci Mitral Valve Repair. Lastly, in head and neck surgery, they include da Vinci Trans oral Robotic Surgery (TORS). In 2011, approximately 360,000 surgical procedures were performed with the da Vinci Surgical System, up approximately 29% compared to 2010. The growth in our overall procedure volume was driven primarily by da Vinci Hysterectomy (dVH) in the U.S., da Vinci Prostatectomy (dVP) outside the U.S. and other urologic and gynecologic procedures including Nephrectomy (partial and full), Sacralcolpopexy, Myomectomy and Endometriosis Resection in the U.S. Emerging procedures within other specialties, including lobectomy for lung cancer and low anterior resection for colon cancer also contributed to 2011 procedure growth. dVH is our highest volume procedure, having surpassed dVP in 2010. dVH procedure volume grew from approximately 110,000 cases in 2010 to approximately 146,000 cases in 2011, of which approximately 39,000 were for the treatment of cancer and the remaining 107,000 related to benign conditions. The very large majority of our 2011 dVH volume came from the U.S. market, where we estimate the total annual addressable robotic market to be approximately 300,000 to 350,000 cases, of which approximately 50,000 are for cancer. dVP procedure volume grew from approximately 98,000 cases in 2010 to approximately 113,000 cases worldwide in 2011. We estimate that the majority of the approximately 85,000 prostatectomies performed each year in the U.S. are done robotically with the da Vinci Surgical System; as such, the 2011 U.S. dVP growth rate was modest. The majority of our 2011 worldwide dVP growth came from European markets, led by Germany and France. Other procedures (non dVH/dVP) grew over approximately 40% in 2011 to approximately 101,000 cases. Growth in these other procedures was driven by da Vinci adoption in urologic and gynecologic procedures such as da Vinci Partial Nephrectomy and da Vinci Sacral Colpopexy as well as early stage growth in other emerging procedures from other surgical specialties, including lobectomy for lung cancer, low anterior resection for colon 39 Table of Contents cancer, and transoral robotic surgery (TORS) for head and neck surgery. While early results in emerging procedures are encouraging and may point to significant patient value, their growth is off of smaller absolute bases and their future growth rates are uncertain. Business Model We generate revenue from both the initial capital sales of da Vinci Surgical Systems as well as recurring revenue, derived from sales of instruments, accessories, and service. The da Vinci Surgical System generally sells for between $1.0 million and $2.3 million, depending upon configuration and geography, and represents a significant capital equipment investment for our customers. We generate recurring revenue as our customers consume our EndoWrist instruments and accessory products used in performing procedures with the da Vinci Surgical System. EndoWrist instruments and accessories have a limited life and will either expire or wear out as they are used in surgery, at which point they are replaced. We also generate recurring revenue from ongoing system service. We typically enter into service contracts at the time systems are sold. These service contracts have been generally renewable at the end of the service period, typically at an annual rate of approximately $100,000 to $170,000 per year, depending upon the configuration of the underlying system. Recurring revenue has grown at a rate equal to or faster than the rate of growth of system revenue. Recurring revenue increased from $561.7 million, or 53% of total revenue in 2009 to $752.7 million, or 53% of total revenue in 2010 to $979.5 million, or 56% of total revenue in 2011. The increase in recurring revenue relative to system revenue reflects continuing adoption of procedures on a growing base of installed da Vinci Surgical Systems. We expect recurring revenue to become a larger percentage of total revenue in the future. The installed base of da Vinci Surgical Systems has grown to 2,132 at December 31, 2011, compared with 1,752 at December 31, 2010 and 1,395 at December 31, 2009. We have a direct sales force in the United States and in Europe, excluding Spain, Italy, Greece and Eastern European countries. We utilize distributors in all other markets that we serve. On January 11, 2012, we completed the acquisition of our Korean distributor and began selling directly to Korean customers. The transaction is not material to our financial statements and is not expected to have a material impact on our future operations. Regulatory Activities We believe that we have obtained the clearances required to market our products to our targeted surgical specialties within the United States and most of Europe. As we make additions to target procedures and introduce new products, we will continue to seek necessary clearances. In November 2009, we received regulatory (Shonin) approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (MHLW) for our da Vinci S System in Japan. Since this regulatory approval we have sold 13 systems into Japan in 2010 and 20 systems in 2011. These sales were primarily made to early adopters. We are currently focusing our efforts on obtaining specific reimbursement for da Vinci procedures in Japan. To date, we have not received reimbursement approval in Japan. If we are not successful in obtaining market authorization, certifications and adequate procedure reimbursements or obtaining approvals for future products and procedures, then the demand for our products in Japan could be limited. We have partnered with the experienced regulatory team from Johnson & Johnson K.K. Medical Company (Japan) in our Japanese regulatory process and are continuing to work with them to transfer the responsibilities for regulatory support of our products in Japan to our subsidiary, Intuitive Surgical K.K. We continue to partner with Adachi Co., LTD as our separate independent distribution partner in Japan who is responsible for marketing, selling, and servicing our products in Japan. The March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan and their aftermath have created economic uncertainty that may disrupt economic activities in Japan for a substantial period of time, including a reduction in hospital spending. As a result, our sales in Japan may be adversely affected. Given the relatively small proportion of our 40 Table of Contents total revenue coming from Japanese customers (approximately 2% of our global revenue in 2011), we do not expect the overall impact on our revenues resulting from the earthquake and tsunami in Japan to be material. 2011 Business Events and Trends Economic Environment. During the first half of 2009, the world wide economic recession curtailed capital purchases of our da Vinci Surgical Systems. Beginning in the second half of 2009 through 2011, the U.S. economy has been recovering slowly. Demand for da Vinci systems in Europe has recovered more slowly than in the U.S. European demand, driven by procedure growth, has been stronger and more consistent in the larger German, French, and Italian markets. Demand in the smaller European economies has been more sporadic. Economic uncertainties within Europe could adversely impact demand for our products. Demand for da Vinci systems fluctuates quarter to quarter based upon changing economic and geopolitical factors. da Vinci Si Surgical System Market Acceptance. In the second quarter of 2009 we launched our newest da Vinci model, the da Vinci Si. The da Vinci Si Surgical System was FDA approved and CE (Conformit&eacute; Europ&eacute;enne) marked upon launch and is currently available in most countries in Europe and Asia, excluding Japan, among others. da Vinci Si Systems are available with an option to purchase a second console. The da Vinci S System can be upgraded to the da Vinci Si System; however, most customers have chosen to trade out their da Vinci S Systems rather than receiving component level field upgrades. We continue to sell, service and support the da Vinci S Surgical System as well. Our sales of the standard da Vinci Surgical System have substantially ended; however, we continue to service and support this product line as well. Market acceptance of the da Vinci Si Surgical System has been positive since its market introduction in the first quarter of 2009. During the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, 495 out of 534 and 372 out of 441 systems sold, respectively, were da Vinci Si models, representing approximately 93% and 84%, respectively, of system sales. da Vinci Skills Simulator. In the first quarter of 2011, we began shipping our da Vinci Skills Simulator. The simulator is a practice tool for the da Vinci Si Surgical System that gives a user the opportunity to practice in his or her facility with the surgeon console controls. The simulator incorporates three dimensional, physics based computer simulation technology to immerse the user within a virtual environment. The user navigates through the environment and completes exercises by controlling virtual instruments from the surgeon console. Upon completion of a skills exercise, the simulator provides a quantitative assessment of user performance based on a variety of task specific metrics. The simulator is intended to augment, not replace, existing training programs for the da Vinci Si Surgical System. Most da Vinci Skills Simulators have been sold in connection with new da Vinci Si Surgical System sales. We sold 383 da Vinci Skills Simulators in the year ended December 31, 2011. da Vinci Single Site Instruments. da Vinci Single Site is a set of instruments and accessories that allow the da Vinci Si systems to work through a single incision rather than multiple incisions. Single incision surgery is intended to minimize trauma to patients by reducing the number of ports required to enter the body. Non robotic single incision surgery today is typically performed with modified laparoscopic instruments. Early clinical adoption of this manual technique has been mostly positive, however, physicians have reported that manual single incision surgery is technically and ergonomically challenging. da Vinci Single Site instruments and accessories were designed to address these issues. In February 2011 we received the CE mark for our da Vinci Single Site instrument kit and began selling these new products in Europe. The vast majority of da Vinci Single Site procedures performed in Europe to date have been cholecystectomies. In December 2011 we received FDA regulatory clearance to market our Single Site instrumentation in the United States for laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures. We are not able to predict whether or the extent to which da Vinci Single Site will be adopted. We also are not able to predict whether the FDA will approve Single Site for use in other indications. da Vinci Firefly Fluorescence Imaging. In the first quarter of 2011, we launched our new Firefly Fluorescence Imaging product for use with the da Vinci Si Surgical System in the U.S. and Europe. This new 41 Table of Contents imaging capability combines a fluorescent dye with a specialized da Vinci camera head, endoscope and laser based illuminator to allow surgeons to identify vasculature in three dimensions beneath tissue surfaces to visualize critical anatomy. Our phased roll out of the Firefly Fluorescence Imaging product is progressing, with its initial use targeted in partial nephrectomy procedures. General surgeons are beginning to evaluate the value of fluorescence imaging in colorectal surgery to assess tissue perfusion. EndoWrist One Vessel Sealer. In December 2011, we received FDA clearance for the EndoWrist One Vessel Sealer. The EndoWrist One Vessel Sealer is a wristed, single use instrument intended for bipolar coagulation and mechanical transection of vessels up to 7 mm in diameter and tissue bundles that fit in the jaws of the instrument. This instrument enables da Vinci Si surgeons to fully control vessel sealing, while providing the benefits of da Vinci Surgery. This instrument is designed to enhance surgical efficiency and autonomy in a variety of general surgery and gynecologic procedures. We are not able to predict whether or the extent to which the EncoWrist One Vessel Sealer will be adopted. Other Product Introductions. In the second quarter of 2011, we released in the U.S. and Europe our new thoracic grasper and dissecting bipolar instruments. In the U.S. we also released a medium/large clip applier. These new instruments are targeted to enhance the da Vinci Systems surgical capability in emerging lobectomy and general surgery procedures. We had also received the CE mark in the second quarter of 2011 and FDA approval in the third quarter of 2011 for our new suction irrigation instrument, which is also designed to facilitate thoracic as well as general surgery and gynecologic procedures. 2011 Financial Highlights Total revenue increased 24% to $1,757.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 from $1,413.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. Approximately 360,000 da Vinci procedures were performed during the year ended December 31, 2011, up approximately 29% from last year. Instruments and accessories revenue increased 33% to $701.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 from $528.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. Recurring revenue increased 30% to $979.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2011, representing 56% of total revenue from $752.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, representing 53% of total revenue. We sold 534 da Vinci Surgical Systems during the year ended December 31, 2011, compared with 441 for the year ended December 31, 2010. System revenue increased 18% to $777.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 from $660.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2011, we had a da Vinci Surgical System installed base of 2,132 systems 1,548 in the United States, 372 in Europe, and 212 in the rest of the world. Operating income increased 25% to $694.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $555.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. Operating income included $136.4 million and $117.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, of stock based compensation expense related to employee stock programs. We ended fiscal 2011 with $2,171.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments increased by $562.9 million during 2011 driven by cash flow from operations and $260.6 million generated from employee stock programs, partially offset by $331.8 million used to repurchase and retire 1.0 million shares of common stock, and $82.9 million used for capital expenditures and the purchase of intellectual property. 42 Table of Contents Technology and Other Acquisitions We continue to make strategic acquisitions of intellectual property and related technologies. Total investments in intellectual property and related technologies during the year ended December 31, 2011 were $16.8 million, compared to $38.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. Amortization expense related to purchased intellectual property for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were $17.8 million and $16.7 million, respectively. On January 11, 2012, we completed the acquisition of our Korean distributor. The total purchase consideration of the acquisition was not material, and the acquisition is not expected to have a material impact on our future results of operations.

Total revenue increased to $1,757.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 from $1,413.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 and from $1,052.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. Total revenue growth was driven by the continued adoption of da Vinci Surgery. We believe that robotic surgery will be adopted surgical procedure by surgical procedure, driving higher system and recurring revenue. Our revenue growth during the periods presented 43 Table of Contents reflects further penetration in our target procedures. dVH and dVP are our two largest procedures, representing more than 70% of our total procedures over the past several years. Revenue within the United States accounted for 78%, 80%, and 79% of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. We believe domestic revenue has accounted for the large majority of total revenue primarily due to the ability of patients to choose their provider and method of treatment in the U.S. The following table summarizes our revenue and da Vinci Surgical System unit sales information for the years indicated (in millions, except unit sales and percentages): Year Ended December 31, Revenue 2011 2010 2009 Instruments and accessories $ 701.1 $ 528.8 $ 389.4 Systems 777.8 660.3 490.5 Total product revenue 1,478.9 1,189.1 879.9 Services 278.4 223.9 172.3 Total revenue $ 1,757.3 $ 1,413.0 $ 1,052.2 Recurring revenue 979.5 752.7 561.7 % of total revenue 56 % 53 % 53 % Revenue Domestic 1,378.7 1,126.0 827.0 Revenue International 378.6 287.0 225.2 Total revenue 1,757.3 1,413.0 1,052.2 Unit Sales by Region: Domestic Unit Sales 400 335 252 International Unit Sales 134 106 86 Total Unit Sales 534 441 338 Unit Sales by Model: da Vinci Si Single console Unit Sales 400 304 176 da Vinci Si Dual console Unit Sales 95 68 33 Total da Vinci Si Unit Sales 495 372 209 da Vinci S Unit Sales 39 69 120 da Vinci standard Unit Sales 9 Total Unit Sales 534 441 338 Unit Sales involving System Trade ins: Unit sales trading in da Vinci standard Surgical Systems 65 75 54 Unit sales trading in da Vinci S Surgical Systems 88 9 Total unit sales involving trade ins 153 84 54 Unit Sales not trading in any systems 381 357 284 Total Unit Sales 534 441 338 Product Revenue Product revenue increased to $1,478.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 from $1,189.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. 44 Table of Contents Instruments and accessories revenue increased to $701.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, up 33% compared with $528.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in revenue was driven by an approximate 29% increase in procedure volume and, to a lesser extent, higher initial instrument and accessory stocking orders associated with higher 2011 system unit sales and recently released instrument and accessory products, including the 8.5mm endoscope, thoracic grasper, Firefly Fluorescence Imaging products, and da Vinci Single Site instruments. Procedure growth occurred in all of our targeted procedures with dVH and dVP being the largest drivers of growth. Utilization per installed system for the year ended December 31, 2011 also increased as compared with the year ended December 31, 2010. Instrument and accessory list pricing remained unchanged from 2010 to 2011. Systems revenue increased to $777.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2011, up 18% from $660.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily due to the sale of 93 more systems in 2011. Prior to the fourth quarter 2010, transactions involving customers transitioning from da Vinci S to a da Vinci Si Surgical System were included in upgrade revenue and excluded from the system count. The current treatment reflects the current nature of the higher priced transactions where customers are now shipped completely new da Vinci Si Surgical Systems in exchange for their used da Vinci S Surgical Systems, rather than receiving component level field upgrades of their da Vinci S units. There were 29 field upgrades of da Vinci S Surgical Systems to da Vinci Si Surgical Systems during the first nine months of 2010. The 2011 average selling price (ASP) of $1.44 million was approximately equal the 2010 ASP. System upgrade revenue was $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The 2010 upgrade revenue included the 29 field upgrades of da Vinci S Surgical Systems to da Vinci Si Surgical Systems. Product revenue increased to $1,189.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 from $879.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. Instruments and accessories revenue increased to $528.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, up 36% compared with $389.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in revenue was driven by an increase in procedures performed and, to a lesser extent, higher initial instrument and accessory stocking orders associated with higher 2010 system unit sales. Procedure growth occurred in all of our targeted procedures with dVH and dVP being the largest drivers of growth. Utilization per installed system for the year ended December 31, 2010 also increased as compared with the year ended December 31, 2009. Instrument and accessory list pricing remained unchanged from 2009 to 2010. Systems revenue increased to $660.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, up 35% from $490.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to 103 more systems sold in 2010. The 2010 average selling price (ASP) of $1.44 million was higher than the 2009 ASP of $1.39 million, resulting from a higher percentage of the higher priced single and dual console da Vinci Si Surgical Systems in the systems product mix. System upgrade revenue was $25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Service Revenue Service revenue, comprised primarily of system service and customer training, increased 24% to $278.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $223.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. We typically enter into service contracts at the time systems are sold. These service contracts have been generally renewed at the end of the service period. Higher service revenue for 2011 was driven by a larger base of da Vinci Surgical Systems producing contract service revenue. 45 Table of Contents Service revenue increased 30% to $223.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $172.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Higher service revenue for 2010 was driven by a larger base of da Vinci Surgical Systems producing contract service revenue. Gross Profit Product gross profit during the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 23% to $1,096.6 million, or 74.1% of product revenue, compared with $891.8 million, or 75.0% of product revenue, during the year ended December 31, 2010. The higher product gross profit was driven by higher 2011 product revenue, as described above. The lower product gross profit percentage for the year ended December 31, 2011 reflects the inclusion of lower margin da Vinci Skills Simulators in 2011. Product gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 reflected stock based compensation expense of $12.3 million and $9.6 million, respectively. Service gross profit during the year ended December 31, 2011 increased to $177.2 million, or 63.7% of service revenue, compared with $138.2 million, or 61.7% of service revenue during the year ended December 31, 2010. The higher 2011 service gross profit was driven by a larger installed base. The higher 2011 gross service profit percentage was primarily driven by lower service parts consumption and costs associated with field upgrades. Service gross profit during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 reflected stock based compensation expense of $11.0 million and $8.4 million, respectively. Product gross profit during the year ended December 31, 2010 was $891.8 million, or 75.0% of product revenue, compared with $642.3 million, or 73.0% of product revenue, during the year ended December 31, 2009. The higher product gross profit was driven by higher 2010 product revenue, as described above. The higher product gross profit percentage was driven by higher 2010 system ASPs, system and instrument material cost reductions, lower 2010 charges for excess and obsolete inventory, and leveraging manufacturing overhead across higher revenue. Product gross profit for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 reflected stock based compensation expense of $9.6 million and $7.7 million, respectively. Service gross profit during the year ended December 31, 2010 was $138.2 million, or 61.7% of service revenue, compared with $108.8 million, or 63.1% of service revenue during the year ended December 31, 2009. The higher 2010 service gross profit was driven by a larger installed base. The lower 2010 gross service profit percentage was primarily driven by higher 2010 field upgrade costs. Service gross profit during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 reflected stock based compensation expense of $8.4 million and $6.6 million, respectively. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses include costs for sales, marketing and administrative personnel, sales and marketing activities, tradeshow expenses, legal expenses, regulatory fees and general corporate expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 22% to $438.8 million compared to $358.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increases were due to organizational growth to support our expanding business, higher commissions related to higher revenue levels, and increased stock based compensation. Stock based compensation expense charged to sales, general and administrative expenses during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were $84.3 million and $77.0 million, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 29% to $358.8 million compared to $278.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increases were due to organizational growth to support our expanding business, particularly in the expansion of our clinical sales force, where headcount increased to 467 at December 31, 2010 from 309 at December 31, 2009, higher commissions 46 Table of Contents related to higher revenue levels, and increased stock based compensation. Stock based compensation expense charged to sales, general and administrative expenses during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $77.0 million and $61.3 million, respectively. Research and Development Expenses Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses include costs associated with the design, development, testing and significant enhancement of our products. These enhancements represent significant improvements to our products. Research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 21% to $140.2 million compared to $116.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. The increases were due to the growth in our research and development organization and higher prototype costs directed at the development of new products including our suction irrigation, vessel sealing and stapling products, as well as our da Vinci Single Site instruments, and higher stock based compensation expenses. Amortization expense related to purchased intellectual property during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were $13.4 million and $14.4 million, respectively. Stock based compensation expense charged to research and development expense during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were $28.8 million and $22.6 million, respectively. We expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development and anticipate that research and development expenses, including the co development arrangement with industry partners, will continue to increase in the future. Research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 22% to $116.0 million compared to $95.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase is due to the growth in our research and development organization and higher product prototype expenses. Amortization expense related to purchased intellectual property during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $14.4 million for each year. Stock based compensation expense charged to research and development expense during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $22.6 million and $21.4 million, respectively. Interest and Other Income, Net Interest and other income, net, was $14.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $17.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Lower interest and other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2011 was driven by lower interest income resulting from lower rates earned on higher cash and investment balances, lower foreign exchange gains from the deterioration of the U.S. dollar, and other non operating expenses. Interest and other income, net, was $17.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Lower interest and other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2010 was driven by lower interest rates earned on cash and investment balances in 2010, partially offset by fluctuations in foreign exchange gains and losses. Income Tax Expense Our income tax expense was $214.6 million, $190.5 million, and $163.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2011 was approximately 30.2% compared with 33.3% for 2010. Our tax rate for the years 2011 and 2010 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to the effect of income earned by certain of our overseas entities being taxed at rates lower than the federal statutory rate and research and development (R&D) credits, partially offset by state income taxes net of federal benefit and non deductible stock option expenses. The effective tax rate for 2009 was approximately 41.3%, which differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to state income taxes net of federal benefit and non deductible stock option compensation, partially offset by R&D credits and 47 Table of Contents domestic production deductions generated in 2009. The lower effective tax rate in 2011 and 2010 as compared to 2009 is due primarily to an increase in foreign earnings on which U.S. income taxes have not been provided as such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S., and lower state income taxes. A California tax law change enacted in February 2009 allows an elective single sales factor for state apportionment for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2011. We expect to benefit from the California single sales factor election for apportioning income for years 2011 and beyond. As a result of our anticipated election of the single sales factor, in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, we re measured our deferred tax assets in the first quarter of 2009, taking into account the reversal pattern and the expected California tax rate under the elective single sales factor. In addition, a valuation allowance of $2.8 million was recorded against the California deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2011 because it is more likely than not these deferred tax assets will not be realized as a result of the reduction in California taxes under the single sales factor election. The federal R&D credit expired as of December 31, 2011, and it is uncertain whether it will be extended. If the credit is extended by the U.S. Congress for the year 2012, the associated tax benefit will be recognized as a discrete item in the quarter in which the extension is granted. Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources and Uses of Cash Our principal source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and the exercise of stock options. Cash and cash equivalents plus short and long term investments increased from $1,172.0 million at December 31, 2009, to $1,608.9 million at December 31, 2010, to $2,171.8 million at December 31, 2011. Cash generation is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting our operating, investing and financing needs. As of December 31, 2011, $327.5 million of our cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. We currently have no plans to repatriate any foreign earnings back to the U.S. as we believe our cash flows provided by our U.S. operations will meet our U.S. liquidity needs. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for discussion on the impact of interest rate risk and market risk on our investment portfolio. Consolidated Cash Flow Data Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (in millions) Net cash provided by (used in) Operating activities $ 677.6 $ 545.8 $ 392.2 Investing activities (479.0 ) (494.3 ) (299.5 ) Financing activities (12.4 ) 7.7 (66.2 ) Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (0.2 ) (0.8 ) 0.3 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 186.0 $ 58.4 $ 26.8 48 Table of Contents Operating Activities During the year ended December 31, 2011, cash flow from operations of $677.6 million exceeded our net income of $495.1 million for two primary reasons: 1) Our net income included substantial non cash charges in the form of stock based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, taxes and depreciation. These non cash charges totaled $202.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2011. 2) Cash used in working capital during the year ended December 31, 2011 was approximately $19.9 million. Working capital is comprised primarily of accounts receivable, inventory, deferred revenue and other liabilities. Inventory increased by $25.3 million or 29% in 2011 due to our business growth, expanded product offerings, and safety stocks acquired for key components. Deferred revenue, which includes deferred service contract revenue that is being amortized over the service contract period, increased $28.1 million or 22% in 2011 primarily due to the increase in the number of installed systems for which service contracts exist. Other liabilities including accounts payable, accrued compensation and employee benefits, and accrued liabilities increased $37.8 million or 17% in 2011, primarily due to timing of vendor, tax and employee compensation payments during 2011. During the year ended December 31, 2010, cash flow from operations of $545.8 million exceeded our net income of $381.8 million for two primary reasons: 1) Our net income included substantial non cash charges in the form of stock based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, taxes and depreciation. These non cash charges totaled $147.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. 2) Cash provided by working capital during the year ended December 31, 2010 was approximately $17.0 million. Inventory increased by $29.2 million or 51% in 2010. The growth in inventory reflects increased revenue, increases to ensure adequate supply of key components as December 31st, 2010 quantities were below optimal levels and inventory associated with new product introductions. Deferred revenue, which includes deferred service contract revenue that is being amortized over the service contract period, increased $26.5 million or 26% in 2010 primarily due to the increase in the number of installed systems for which service contracts exist. Other liabilities including accounts payable, accrued compensation and employee benefits, and accrued liabilities increased $60.1 million or 35% in 2010, primarily due to timing of vendor, tax and employee compensation payments during 2010. During the year ended December 31, 2009, cash flow from operations of $392.2 million exceeded our net income of $232.6 million for two primary reasons: 1) Our net income included substantial non cash charges in the form of stock based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, taxes and depreciation. These non cash charges totaled $121.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. 2) Cash provided by working capital and other assets during the year ended December 31, 2009 was approximately $38.0 million. Accounts receivable increased $35.3 million or 21% in 2009, primarily reflecting increased revenue. Deferred revenue, which includes deferred service contract revenue that is being amortized over the service contract period, increased $21.3 million or 27% in 2009, which is primarily related to the increase in the number of installed systems for which service contracts exist. Other liabilities including accounts payable, accrued compensation and employee benefits, and accrued liabilities increased $52.4 million or 41% in 2009, reflecting changes in the volume of our business and timing of vendor payments and an increase in unrecognized tax benefits. 49 Table of Contents Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 consisted primarily of purchases of investments (net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments) of $396.1 million, $398.3 million and $246.1 million, respectively, and purchases of property and equipment and licensing of intellectual property of $82.9 million, $96.0 million and $53.4 million, respectively. We invest predominantly in high quality, fixed income securities. Our investment portfolio may at any time contain investments in U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities, taxable and or tax exempt municipal notes (some of which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, cash deposits and money market funds. We are not a capital intensive business. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities in 2011 consisted primarily of $331.8 million used for the repurchase of 1.0 million shares of our common stock through open market transactions, offset by proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $260.6 million, and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation of $58.8 million. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2010 consisted primarily of proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $141.1 million and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation of $65.2 million, offset by $198.6 million for the repurchase of approximately 0.7 million shares of our common stock through open market transactions. Net cash used in financing activities in 2009 consisted primarily of $150.0 million used for the repurchase of 1.4 million shares of our common stock through an accelerated repurchase program, offset by proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $58.7 million, and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation of $25.1 million. Our cash requirements depend on numerous factors, including market acceptance of our products, the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products and other factors. We expect to continue to devote substantial resources to expand procedure adoption and acceptance of our products investments. In 2011, we made substantial investments in our commercial operations, product development activities, facilities and intellectual property. Based upon our business model, we anticipate that we will continue to be able to fund future growth through cash provided from operations. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, together with income to be derived from the sale of our products, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011 (in millions): Payments due by period Total Less than 1year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years More than 5years Operating leases $ 7.3 $ 2.7 $ 3.5 $ 0.9 $ 0.2 Purchase commitments and obligations 225.5 225.1 0.4 Total contractual obligations $ 232.8 $ 227.8 $ 3.9 $ 0.9 $ 0.2 Operating leases. We lease office spaces in the United States, Switzerland, Mexico, Japan and China. We also lease automobiles for certain sales and field service employees. Operating lease amounts include future minimum lease payments under all our non cancelable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year. Purchase commitments and obligations. These amounts include an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, including commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services and acquisition and licensing of intellectual property. A majority of these purchase obligations are due within a year. Although open purchase orders are 50 Table of Contents considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services. In addition to the above, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing, collaboration and development arrangements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and have not been included in the table above. Other commitments. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when payments may occur for our unrecognized tax benefits. Therefore, our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2011, we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K promulgated under the Exchange Act. Critical Accounting Estimates Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP), which requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions. See Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, which describes our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting estimates include: the valuation and recognition of investments, which impacts our investment portfolio balance when we assess fair value, and interest and other income, net, when we record impairments; the valuation of revenue and allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts, which impacts revenue; the estimation of transactions to hedge, which impacts revenue and other expense; the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margins; the assessment of recoverability of intangibles and the estimated useful lives, which primarily impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their amortization; the valuation and recognition of share based compensation, which impacts gross margin and operating expenses; and the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes. Investments Valuation Fair Value Our investment portfolio may at any time contain investments in U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities, taxable and or tax exempt municipal notes (some of which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, cash deposits and money market funds. In the current market environment, the assessment of the fair value of the investments can be difficult and subjective. U.S. GAAP establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. Each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value. Valuation of Level 1 and 2 instruments generally do not require significant management judgment and the estimation is not difficult. Level 3 instruments include 51 Table of Contents unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The determination of fair value for Level 3 instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity. All of the securities classified as Level 3 instruments are municipal bonds with an auction reset feature (auction rate securities or ARS) whose underlying assets are student loans which are substantially backed by the federal government. These ARS represent less than 1% of our total investment portfolio as of December 31, 2011. Since the auctions for these securities have continued to fail since February 2008, these investments are not currently trading and therefore do not have a readily determinable market value. Accordingly, the estimated fair value of the ARS no longer approximates par value. We have valued the ARS using a discounted cash flow model based on Level 3 assumptions, including estimates of, based on data available as of December 31, 2011, interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows, credit and liquidity premiums and expected holding periods of the ARS. Changes in associated market value have been recorded through other comprehensive income. If market conditions deteriorate further, we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in other comprehensive income or impairment charges. We may not be able to liquidate these investments unless the issuer calls the security, a successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the auction process, or the security matures. Other than temporary impairment After determining the fair value of our available for sales debt instruments, gains or losses on these securities are recorded to other comprehensive income, until either the security is sold or we determine that the decline in value is other than temporary. The primary differentiating factors we considered in classifying impairments as either temporary or other than temporary impairments are our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, the length of the time and the extent to which the market value of the investment has been less than cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer. Given the current market conditions, these judgments could prove to be wrong, and companies with relatively high credit ratings and solid financial conditions may not be able to fulfill their obligations. No impairment charges were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, our cumulative unrealized gains related to our investments classified as available for sale was approximately $1.1 million and $1.3 million, respectively. Allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts. We record estimated reductions in revenue for potential returns of products by customers and other allowances. As a result, management must make estimates of potential future product returns and other allowances related to current period product revenue. In making such estimates, management analyzes historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products. If management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates, material differences in the amount of reported revenue could result. Similarly, management makes estimates of the uncollectibility of accounts receivable, especially analyzing accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms, when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Credit evaluations are undertaken for all major sale transactions before shipment is authorized. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate aged items in the accounts receivable aging report and provide an allowance in an amount we deem adequate for doubtful accounts. If management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates, material differences in the amount of our reported operating expenses could result. Inventory valuation. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first in, first out basis. The carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between 52 Table of Contents its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand. We evaluate the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Intangible Assets. Our intangible assets include identifiable intangibles and goodwill. Identifiable intangibles include developed technology, patents, and licenses. All of our identifiable intangibles have finite lives. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to an annual impairment review (or more frequent if impairment indicators arise) by applying a fair value based test. There have been no impairments from the analysis required by U.S. GAAP. Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are subject to impairment testing and are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that such assets may not be recoverable at their carrying value. We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of these identifiable intangibles based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from such assets. If the cash flow estimates or the significant operating assumptions upon which they are based change in the future, we may be required to record additional impairment charges. When events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable, we recognize such impairment in the event the net book value of such assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets. We have intangible assets and goodwill on our balance sheet. The valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful amortization lives involves judgments and the use of estimates. The evaluation of these intangibles and goodwill for impairment under established accounting guidelines is required on a recurring basis. Changes in business conditions could potentially require future adjustments to asset valuations. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of amortization over the assets new, shorter useful lives. No impairment charge or accelerated amortization was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing impairment, which includes financial forecasts. Should conditions be different from managements current estimates, material write downs of long lived assets may be required, which would adversely affect our operating results. Revenue recognition. We frequently enter into revenue arrangements that contain multiple elements or deliverables such as system and services. Judgments as to the allocation of the proceeds received from an arrangement to the multiple elements of the arrangement, the determination of whether any undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are critical in respect to these arrangements to ensure compliance with U.S. GAAP. Changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition. Revenue recognition also depends on the timing of shipment and is subject to customer acceptance. If shipments are not made on scheduled timelines or if the products are not accepted by the customer in a timely manner, our reported revenues may differ materially from expectations. In September 2009, the FASB amended the accounting standards related to revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables and arrangements that include software elements (new accounting principles). The new accounting principles permit prospective or retrospective adoption, and we elected prospective adoption at the beginning of the first quarter of 2010. These new accounting principles do not generally change the units of accounting for our revenue transactions and we continue to have system and service as the different elements in our multiple element arrangements. For multiple element arrangements entered into on or after January 1, 2010, we allocate revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. Because we have neither vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) nor third 53 Table of Contents party evidence of selling price (TPE) for our systems, the allocation of revenue has been based on estimated selling prices (ESPs). The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product was sold on a stand alone basis. We determine ESP for our systems by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, features and functionality of the system, geographies, type of customer and market conditions. We review ESP regularly and maintain internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates. Since we apply significant judgment in arriving at the ESPs, any material changes would significantly affect the allocation of the total consideration to the different elements of a multiple element arrangement. Hedge Accounting for Derivatives. We utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency sales transactions. When specific criteria required by relevant accounting standards have been met, changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI) rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When we determine that the transactions are no longer probable within a certain timeframe, we are required to reclassify the cumulative changes in the fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to net income. Accounting for stock options. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of U.S. GAAP. We use the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions. These assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them, the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements. The assumptions for expected volatility and expected term are the two assumptions that significantly affect the grant date fair value. Changes in expected risk free rate of return do not significantly impact the calculation of fair value, and determining this input is not highly subjective. We use implied volatility based on freely traded options in the open market, as we believe implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility. In determining the appropriateness of implied volatility, we considered the following: the volume of market activity of freely traded options, and determined that there was sufficient market activity; the ability to reasonably match the input variables of freely traded options to those options granted, such as the date of the grant and the exercise price, and determined that the input assumptions were comparable; and the term of freely traded options used to derive implied volatility, which is generally at least one year, and determined that the length of term was sufficient. The expected term represents the weighted average period that our stock options are expected to be outstanding. The expected term is based on the observed and expected time to post vesting exercise of options by employees. We use historical exercise patterns of previously granted options in relation to stock price movements to derive an employee behavioral pattern used to forecast expected exercise patterns. U.S. GAAP requires us to develop an estimate of the number of share based awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover. Adjustments in the estimated forfeiture rates can have a significant effect on our reported share based compensation, as we recognize the cumulative effect of the rate adjustments for all expense amortization in the period the estimated forfeiture rates were adjusted. We estimate and adjust forfeiture rates based on a periodic review of recent forfeiture activity and expected future employee turnover. If a revised forfeiture rate is higher than previously estimated forfeiture rate, we may make an adjustment that will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements during the period when the rate was changed. Adjustments in the estimated forfeiture rates could also cause changes in the amount of expense that we recognize in future periods. 54 Table of Contents Changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and, consequently, the related amount recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Accounting for income taxes. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in the current or subsequent period. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is less than a 50% likelihood, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be recoverable. As of December 31, 2011, we believe it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets ultimately will be recovered with the exception of our California deferred tax assets. We believe that because of the anticipated benefit from the California single sale factor election, it is more likely than not that our California deferred tax assets will not be realized. Should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would be affected in the period in which such change takes place. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, then the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We re evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effective settlement of audit issues, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 2.
