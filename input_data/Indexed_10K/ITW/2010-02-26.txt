ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations INTRODUCTION Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the Company or ITW) is a multinational manufacturer of a diversified range of industrial products and equipment with approximately 840 operations in 57 countries. These 840 businesses are internally reported as 60 operating segments to senior management. The Companys 60 operating segments have been aggregated into the following eight external reportable segments: Transportation; Industrial Packaging; Food Equipment; Power Systems Electronics; Construction Products; Polymers Fluids; Decorative Surfaces; and All Other. In August 2008, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the divestiture of the Decorative Surfaces segment which was subsequently classified as a discontinued operation. In May 2009, the Companys Board of Directors rescinded its earlier resolution to divest the Decorative Surfaces segment and, accordingly, all periods presented have been restated to present the Decorative Surfaces segment as a continuing operation. Due to the large number of diverse businesses and the Companys highly decentralized operating style, the Company does not require its businesses to provide detailed information on operating results. Instead, the Companys corporate management collects data on several key measurements: operating revenues, operating income, operating margins, overhead costs, number of months on hand in inventory, days sales outstanding in accounts receivable, past due receivables and return on invested capital. These key measures are monitored by management and significant changes in operating results versus current trends in end markets and variances from forecasts are discussed with operating unit management. The results of each segment are analyzed by identifying the effects of changes in the results of the base businesses, newly acquired companies, restructuring costs, goodwill and intangible impairment charges, and currency translation on the operating revenues and operating income of each segment. Base businesses are those businesses that have been included in the Companys results of operations for more than 12 months. The changes to base business operating income include the estimated effects of both operating leverage and changes in variable margins and overhead costs. Operating leverage is the estimated effect of the base business revenue changes on operating income, assuming variable margins remain the same as the prior period. As manufacturing and administrative overhead costs usually do not significantly change as a result of revenues increasing or decreasing, the percentage change in operating income due to operating leverage is usually more than the percentage change in the base business revenues. A key element of the Companys business strategy is its continuous 80/20 business process for both existing businesses and new acquisitions. The basic concept of this 80/20 business process is to focus on what is most important (the 20% of the items which account for 80% of the value) and to spend less time and resources on the less important (the 80% of the items which account for 20% of the value). The Companys operations use this 80/20 business process to simplify and focus on the key parts of their business, and as a result, reduce complexity that often disguises what is truly important. The Companys 840 operations utilize the 80/20 process in various aspects of their business. Common applications of the 80/20 business process include: Simplifying product lines by reducing the number of products offered by combining the features of similar products, outsourcing products or, as a last resort, eliminating low value products. Segmenting the customer base by focusing on the 80/20 customers separately and finding alternative ways to serve the 20/80 customers. Simplifying the supplier base by partnering with 80/20 suppliers and reducing the number of 20/80 suppliers. Designing business processes, systems and measurements around the 80/20 activities. The result of the application of this 80/20 business process is that the Company has over time improved its long term operating and financial performance. These 80/20 efforts can result in restructuring projects that reduce costs and improve margins. Corporate management works closely with those businesses that have operating results below expectations to help those businesses better apply this 80/20 business process and improve their results. 15 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Companys consolidated results of operations for 2009, 2008 and 2007 are summarized as follows: Dollars in thousands 2009 2008 2007 Operating revenues $ 13,877,068 $ 17,100,341 $ 16,110,267 Operating income 1,385,979 2,501,286 2,627,766 Margin % 10.0 % 14.6 % 16.3 % In 2009 and 2008, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors: 2009 Compared to 2008 2008 Compared to 2007 % Point Increase % Point Increase % Increase (Decrease) (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) (Decrease) Operating Operating Operating Operating Operating Operating Revenues Income Margins Revenues Income Margins Base business: Revenue change/Operating leverage (18.4 )% (51.8 )% (6.0 )% (2.6 )% (6.0 )% (0.6 )% Changes in variable margins and overhead costs 21.2 3.8 (1.7 ) (0.3 ) (18.4 ) (30.6 ) (2.2 ) (2.6 ) (7.7 ) (0.9 ) Acquisitions and divestitures 4.2 (0.6 ) 6.0 1.4 (0.7 ) Restructuring costs (4.1 ) (0.7 ) (1.0 ) (0.2 ) Impairment of goodwill and intangibles (4.1 ) (0.7 ) Translation (4.8 ) (5.8 ) (0.4 ) 2.8 2.5 Other 0.2 (0.1 ) 0.1 (18.8 )% (44.6 )% (4.6 )% 6.1 % (4.8 )% (1.7 )% Operating Revenues Revenues decreased 18.8% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily due to lower base revenues and the unfavorable effect of currency translation, mainly due to the strengthening of the dollar, partially offset by revenues from acquisitions. Total base revenues declined 18.4% in 2009 versus 2008. Base revenues declined 21.6% and 14.9% for North American and international businesses, respectively, as both were adversely affected by the global recession and weak industrial production in related end markets throughout 2009. The Company anticipates modest expansion in a variety of worldwide end markets in 2010. Revenues increased 6.1% in 2008 over 2007 primarily due to revenues from acquisitions and the favorable effect of currency translation in the first three quarters of 2008, due to a weakened dollar, partially offset by a decrease in base revenues. During 2008, 50 businesses were acquired worldwide with international businesses representing approximately 39% of the annualized acquired revenues. Base revenues decreased in 2008 versus 2007 due to a 4.8% decline in North American base revenues and flat international base revenues. North American base businesses were adversely affected by steep declines in macro economic trends and related weak industrial production, and a continued decline in the construction and automotive markets. In addition, there was a significant decrease in international industrial production in the fourth quarter of 2008. Operating Income Operating income declined 44.6% in 2009 versus 2008 due to the decline in base revenues, the negative effect of currency translation, increased restructuring charges and increased goodwill and intangible 16 Table of Contents impairment charges. In 2009, the Company recorded impairment charges of $90.0 million and $15.6 million against goodwill and intangibles, respectively. The goodwill and intangible impairments were primarily related to new reporting units which were acquired over the last few years before the recent economic downturn. These charges were driven primarily by lower current forecasts compared to the expected forecasts at the time the reporting units were acquired. The higher restructuring charges reflect the Companys efforts to reduce costs in response to weak economic conditions. Improvements in base variable margins and lower overhead costs increased base margins 3.8% in 2009, as the cumulative benefits of restructuring projects began to be realized and selling price versus material cost comparisons were favorable. Total margins declined by 4.6% in 2009 primarily due to the declines in base revenues, restructuring charges and the goodwill and intangible impairment charges. Operating income in 2008 declined 4.8% versus 2007 due to the decline in base revenues and increased restructuring charges, partially offset by the positive effect of currency translation and income from acquisitions. Total margins declined 1.7% primarily due to the declines in base revenues and the lower margins of acquired companies including acquisition related expenses, which reduced overall margins. Restructuring projects and other cost control measures were implemented in 2008 to better align operating businesses with declining economic conditions, which helped keep overhead expenses favorable to 2007 and partially offset declines in variable margins. TRANSPORTATION Businesses in this segment produce components, fasteners, fluids and polymers, as well as truck remanufacturing and related parts and service. In the Transportation segment, products and services include: metal and plastic components, fasteners and assemblies for automobiles and light trucks; fluids and polymers for auto aftermarket maintenance and appearance; fillers and putties for auto body repair; polyester coatings and patch and repair products for the marine industry; and truck remanufacturing and related parts and service. In 2009, this segment primarily served the automotive original equipment manufacturers and tiers (56%) and automotive aftermarket (28%) markets. The results of operations for the Transportation segment for 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: Dollars in thousands 2009 2008 2007 Operating revenues $ 2,070,938 $ 2,347,366 $ 2,214,413 Operating income 153,674 276,900 372,567 Margin % 7.4 % 11.8 % 16.8 % 17 Table of Contents In 2009 and 2008, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors: 2009 Compared to 2008 2008 Compared to 2007 % Point Increase % Point Increase % Increase (Decrease) (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) (Decrease) Operating Operating Operating Operating Operating Operating Revenues Income Margins Revenues Income Margins Base business: Revenue change/Operating leverage (15.8 )% (49.2 )% (4.7 )% (8.5 )% (19.6 )% (2.0 )% Changes in variable margins and overhead costs 23.1 3.3 (7.8 ) (1.4 ) (15.8 ) (26.1 ) (1.4 ) (8.5 ) (27.4 ) (3.4 ) Acquisitions and divestitures 9.1 (0.5 ) (1.0 ) 10.9 0.2 (1.4 ) Restructuring costs (4.0 ) (0.6 ) (1.9 ) (0.4 ) Impairment of goodwill and intangibles (5.2 ) (0.7 ) Translation (5.1 ) (8.6 ) (0.7 ) 3.6 3.5 0.2 Other (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (11.8 )% (44.5 )% (4.4 )% 6.0 % (25.7 )% (5.0 )% Operating Revenues Revenues declined 11.8% in 2009 versus 2008 due to declines in base revenues and the unfavorable effect of currency translation. Acquisition revenues partially mitigated the base revenue decrease and was primarily related to the purchase of a North American truck remanufacturing and related parts and service business in the third quarter of 2008. Worldwide automotive base revenues declined 19.4% for the full year. North American automotive base revenues declined 24.0% in 2009 due to a decline in car builds of 32%. International automotive base revenues declined 14.6% in 2009 due to a 24% decline in European car builds. The automotive aftermarket businesses, which were less impacted by the economic downturn, declined 7.8%. Revenues increased 6.0% in 2008 over 2007 due to acquisitions and the favorable effect of currency translation partially offset by an 8.5% decline in base revenues. Acquisition revenue was primarily related to the purchase of a North American truck remanufacturing and related parts and service business and a worldwide components business. Base revenues for the North American automotive businesses declined 15.2% primarily due to a 16% decline in automotive production by the North American automotive manufacturers. The decline in automotive builds was driven by low consumer demand and existing high inventory levels. International base automotive revenues declined 6.3% due to unfavorable customer mix and a 3% decline in European vehicle production. Base revenues for the automotive aftermarket businesses in this segment increased 2.3% mainly due to strong sales of automotive additives from North American businesses to Chinese end markets. Operating Income Operating income decreased 44.5% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily due to the decline in base revenues described above, the unfavorable effect of currency translation and higher restructuring charges. In addition, a $12.0 million goodwill impairment charge was recorded in the third quarter of 2009 related to the North American truck remanufacturing and related parts and service business. The increase in restructuring charges is primarily due to continued efforts to reduce costs in response to the decline in worldwide automotive production. Total operating margins declined by 4.4% primarily due to the decline in base revenues described above, partially offset by reductions in overhead expenses, favorable selling price versus material cost comparisons and benefits of restructuring projects. 18 Table of Contents Operating income decreased 25.7% in 2008 versus 2007 primarily due to the negative leverage effect of the decline in base revenues described above, lower base margins and higher restructuring charges partially offset by the favorable impact of currency translation. The increase in operating expenses is primarily due to unrecovered raw material price increases and competitive pricing pressure. Base margins declined 3.4% primarily due to the reduction in base revenues, start up costs to support production at foreign owned manufacturers operating in North America and additional accounts receivable bad debt reserves. INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING Businesses in this segment produce steel, plastic and paper products and equipment used for bundling, shipping and protecting goods in transit. In the Industrial Packaging segment, products include: steel and plastic strapping and related tools and equipment; plastic stretch film and related equipment; paper and plastic products that protect goods in transit; and metal jacketing and other insulation products. In 2009, this segment primarily served the general industrial (29%), primary metals (20%), food and beverage (12%) and construction (10%) markets. The results of operations for the Industrial Packaging segment for 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: Dollars in thousands 2009 2008 2007 Operating revenues $ 1,895,704 $ 2,618,922 $ 2,414,860 Operating income 88,755 281,134 301,251 Margin % 4.7 % 10.7 % 12.5 % In 2009 and 2008, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors: 2009 Compared to 2008 2008 Compared to 2007 % Point Increase % Point Increase % Increase (Decrease) (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) (Decrease) Operating Operating Operating Operating Operating Operating Revenues Income Margins Revenues Income Margins Base business: Revenue change/Operating leverage (22.8 )% (86.4 )% (8.9 )% 0.2 % 0.2 % % Changes in variable margins and overhead costs 30.7 4.3 (9.1 ) (1.1 ) (22.8 ) (55.7 ) (4.6 ) 0.2 (8.9 ) (1.1 ) Acquisitions 1.2 (0.2 ) (0.1 ) 4.8 2.9 (0.2 ) Restructuring costs (4.4 ) (0.6 ) (3.7 ) (0.5 ) Impairment of goodwill and intangibles 0.1 Translation (6.0 ) (8.1 ) (0.8 ) 3.5 2.8 Other 0.1 0.1 (27.6 )% (68.4 )% (6.0 )% 8.5 % (6.7 )% (1.8 )% Operating Revenues Revenues decreased 27.6% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily due to lower base revenues and the unfavorable impact of currency translation. Base revenues declined 34.6% for the North American strapping businesses largely due to declines in consumable and equipment volume in key end markets such as primary metals, 19 Table of Contents construction and general industrial. The international strapping businesses declined 25.4% which were adversely affected by the continued global decline in the industrial production and construction end markets. Worldwide stretch and protective packaging declined 20.0% and 4.7%, respectively. Revenues increased 8.5% in 2008 over 2007 primarily due to revenues from acquired companies and the favorable effect of currency translation. The increase in acquisition revenue was primarily due to the purchase of a European industrial packaging business, a European stretch packaging business, a U.S. protective packaging business and a U.S. equipment business. Total base revenues were virtually flat as a 1.2% and 30.9% increase related to international strapping and worldwide insulation systems, respectively, were offset by a 6.0% and 2.7% decrease related to North American strapping and worldwide protective packaging, respectively. These businesses were especially affected by weakness in the North American primary metals and construction end markets. Operating Income Operating income decreased 68.4% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily due to the negative leverage effect of the decline in base revenues described above, the negative effect of currency translation and higher restructuring charges. Base margins declined 4.6% primarily due to the decline in base revenues discussed above, partially offset by favorable selling price versus material cost comparisons and reduced overhead costs as the benefits of restructuring projects began to be realized. Operating income declined 6.7% in 2008 versus 2007 primarily due to a decrease in base variable margins and increased restructuring charges partially offset by income from acquisitions and the favorable effect of currency translation. The decrease in base variable margins is primarily due to unfavorable selling price versus material cost comparisons and unfavorable product mix. FOOD EQUIPMENT Businesses in this segment produce commercial food equipment and related service. In the Food Equipment segment, products and services include: warewashing equipment; cooking equipment, including ovens, ranges and broilers; refrigeration equipment, including refrigerators, freezers and prep tables; food processing equipment, including slicers, mixers and scales; kitchen exhaust, ventilation and pollution control systems; and food equipment service, maintenance and repair. In 2009, this segment primarily served the food institutional/restaurant (47%), service (32%) and food retail (15%) markets. The results of operations for the Food Equipment segment for 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: Dollars in thousands 2009 2008 2007 Operating revenues $ 1,859,277 $ 2,133,186 $ 1,930,281 Operating income 255,094 320,867 303,349 Margin % 13.7 % 15.0 % 15.7 % 20 Table of Contents In 2009 and 2008, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors: 2009 Compared to 2008 2008 Compared to 2007 % Point Increase % Point Increase % Increase (Decrease) (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) (Decrease) Operating Operating Operating Operating Operating Operating Revenues Income Margins Revenues Income Margins Base business: Revenue change/Operating leverage (9.1 )% (25.4 )% (2.7 )% 1.8 % 4.9 % 0.5 % Changes in variable margins and overhead costs 13.8 2.3 (9.1 ) (11.6 ) (0.4 ) 1.8 4.9 0.5 Acquisitions 1.3 (0.2 ) 6.3 1.9 (0.6 ) Restructuring costs (3.5 ) (0.6 ) (3.1 ) (0.5 ) Translation (5.0 ) (5.4 ) (0.1 ) 2.4 2.1 Other (0.1 ) (12.8 )% (20.5 )% (1.3 )% 10.5 % 5.8 % (0.7 )% Operating Revenues Revenues decreased 12.8% in 2009 versus 2008 due to the decline in base business and the unfavorable effect of currency translation, partially offset by revenues from acquisitions. The acquired revenues were attributable to the acquisition of a European food equipment business. North American food equipment base revenues declined 11.2% while international food equipment base revenues declined 7.9% in 2009 as a result of weak demand across all worldwide markets. Base revenues for the North American institutional/restaurant businesses declined 14.7% as customers delayed equipment purchases. Base service revenues declined a moderate 1.2% as customers continued to maintain existing equipment. Revenues increased 10.5% in 2008 over 2007 due to revenues from acquisitions, the favorable effect of currency translation and base revenue growth. The acquired revenues were primarily attributable to the acquisition of two food processing businesses and two European food equipment businesses. Internationally, base revenues increased 3.2% primarily due to strong institutional and service revenue growth in Asia Pacific and Europe. North American base revenues were flat over 2007 as increased service revenues and retail sales were offset by lower demand for equipment in areas such as casual dining restaurants, hotels and airports. Operating Income Operating income declined 20.5% in 2009 versus 2008 due to the decrease in base revenues described above and the unfavorable effect of currency translation and restructuring charges. Base margins decreased 0.4% primarily due to the decline in base revenues, partially offset by margin gains from favorable selling price versus material cost comparisons, benefits from restructuring projects and favorable product mix. Operating income increased 5.8% in 2008 over 2007 due to the positive effect of leverage from the revenue increase described above, the favorable effect of currency translation and income from acquisitions, partially offset by higher restructuring charges. Operating margins decreased 0.7% due to lower margins of acquired businesses and higher restructuring charges partially offset by margin gains from growth in base revenues. POWER SYSTEMS ELECTRONICS Businesses in this segment produce equipment and consumables associated with specialty power conversion, metallurgy and electronics. 21 Table of Contents In the Power Systems Electronics segment, products include: arc welding equipment; metal arc welding consumables and related accessories; metal solder materials for PC board fabrication; equipment and services for microelectronics assembly; electronic components and component packaging; and airport ground support equipment. In 2009, this segment primarily served the general industrial (46%), electronics (16%) and construction (7%) markets. The results of operations for the Power Systems Electronics segment for 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: Dollars in thousands 2009 2008 2007 Operating revenues $ 1,614,472 $ 2,356,853 $ 2,245,514 Operating income 216,840 464,328 451,714 Margin % 13.4 % 19.7 % 20.1 % In 2009 and 2008, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors: 2009 Compared to 2008 2008 Compared to 2007 % Point Increase % Point Increase % Increase (Decrease) (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) (Decrease) Operating Operating Operating Operating Operating Operating Revenues Income Margins Revenues Income Margins Base business: Revenue change/Operating leverage (31.6 )% (60.7 )% (8.4 )% 0.2 % 0.5 % % Changes in variable margins and overhead costs 20.0 5.7 1.9 0.4 (31.6 ) (40.7 ) (2.7 ) 0.2 2.4 0.4 Acquisitions 2.4 (0.9 ) (0.7 ) 3.2 (0.5 ) (0.7 ) Restructuring costs (3.5 ) (1.0 ) (0.2 ) Impairment of goodwill and intangibles (5.9 ) (1.7 ) (0.2 ) Translation (2.4 ) (2.3 ) (0.2 ) 1.5 1.3 Other 0.1 0.1 (0.1 ) (31.5 )% (53.3 )% (6.3 )% 5.0 % 2.8 % (0.4 )% Operating Revenues Revenues declined 31.5% in 2009 versus 2008 mainly due to declines in base revenues and the negative effect of currency translation. Revenues fell as end market demand continued to decline across the broad spectrum of industries that this segment serves, including key end markets such as commercial construction and general industrial. The revenue decrease was partially offset by 2008 acquisitions, including a welding equipment business and a PC board fabrication business. Worldwide base welding revenues declined 32.7% in 2009. North American welding base businesses declined 36.3% while international welding base businesses declined 23.5%. Base revenues for the electronics businesses fell 30.0% while base revenues in the PC board fabrication businesses fell 44.7%, both largely due to the decline in consumer demand for electronics during 2009. 22 Table of Contents Revenues increased 5.0% in 2008 over 2007 primarily due to revenues from acquisitions and the favorable effect of currency translation. Acquisitions included a worldwide PC board fabrication business and a welding accessories business. Overall base revenues grew a modest 0.2% mainly due to a 19.7% growth in international welding base businesses driven by strong demand in the energy, heavy fabrications and ship building end markets. North American welding base business declined 3.6% primarily due to weak North American industrial production and falling end market demand in key areas such as fabrication, construction, automotive and general industrial. Base revenues for the ground support businesses grew 4.4% related to higher worldwide demand for both military and commercial airport products. Base revenues for the PC board fabrication and electronics related businesses declined 9.4% and 2.4%, respectively, due to lower worldwide market demand, especially in consumer electronics. Operating Income Operating income decreased 53.3% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily due to the declines in base revenues described above, 2009 impairment charges, higher restructuring charges and the negative effect of currency translation. Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $18.0 million and $6.7 million, respectively, were incurred in the PC board fabrication and welding accessories businesses in the first quarter of 2009. Base margins decreased 2.7% primarily due to the declines in base revenues, partially offset by favorable selling price versus material cost comparisons, benefits of restructuring projects and lower overhead costs. Operating income increased 2.8% in 2008 over 2007 primarily due to lower operating expenses and reduced overhead spending within the PC board fabrication businesses as a result of 2007 and 2008 restructuring projects, and the favorable effect of currency translation. Total operating margins decreased 0.4% primarily due to lower margins from acquisitions after acquisition related expenses. CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS Businesses in this segment produce tools, fasteners and other products for construction applications. In the Construction Products segment, products include: fasteners and related fastening tools for wood and metal applications; anchors, fasteners and related tools for concrete applications; metal plate truss components and related equipment and software; and packaged hardware, fasteners, anchors and other products for retail. In 2009, this segment primarily served the residential construction (47%), commercial construction (26%) and renovation construction (24%) markets. The results of operations for the Construction Products segment for 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: Dollars in thousands 2009 2008 2007 Operating revenues $ 1,529,510 $ 1,990,683 $ 2,064,477 Operating income 97,864 244,822 289,064 Margin % 6.4 % 12.3 % 14.0 % 23 Table of Contents In 2009 and 2008, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors: 2009 Compared to 2008 2008 Compared to 2007 % Point Increase % Point Increase % Increase (Decrease) (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) (Decrease) Operating Operating Operating Operating Operating Operating Revenues Income Margins Revenues Income Margins Base business: Revenue change/Operating leverage (16.9 )% (59.2 )% (6.3 )% (7.3 )% (21.8 )% (2.2 )% Changes in variable margins and overhead costs 13.3 2.0 1.7 0.3 (16.9 ) (45.9 ) (4.3 ) (7.3 ) (20.1 ) (1.9 ) Acquisitions 0.7 (1.0 ) (0.2 ) 0.5 (0.9 ) (0.2 ) Restructuring costs (1.9 ) (0.3 ) 2.2 0.3 Impairment of goodwill and intangibles Translation (7.0 ) (11.2 ) (1.1 ) 3.3 3.5 0.1 Other (0.1 ) (23.2 )% (60.0 )% (5.9 )% (3.6 )% (15.3 )% (1.7 )% Operating Revenues Revenues declined 23.2% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily as a result of the decline in base revenues and the unfavorable effect of currency translation. Base revenues for the North American, European and Asia Pacific regions decreased 26.7%, 22.9% and 1.1%, respectively, primarily due to ongoing weakness in the residential and commercial construction markets in North America and Europe. U.S. housing starts declined 14% on an annualized basis in 2009. In addition, U.S. commercial construction square footage activity fell 46% for the year versus 2008. The Asia Pacific region outperformed other regions largely due to better customer activity in Australia and New Zealand. Revenues declined 3.6% in 2008 versus 2007 largely as a result of a 7.3% decline in base business partially offset by the favorable effect of currency translation. Base revenues for the North American and European businesses declined 14.6% and 7.0%, respectively, in 2008 while revenues for the Asia Pacific region increased 4.4% on strong first half 2008 market demand and new product introductions. This decline in base revenues was a result of weakness in the residential and commercial construction markets in North America and Europe as indicated by a 31% and 19% decline in U.S. housing starts and commercial construction square footage activity, respectively, in 2008. European construction activity slowed substantially in the fourth quarter of 2008. Operating Income Operating income decreased 60.0% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily due to the base revenue decline described above. In addition, the unfavorable effect of currency translation and higher restructuring charges contributed to the lower income and margins. Base margins declined 4.3% as reduced operating expenses, including favorable selling price versus material cost comparisons and benefits from restructuring projects were more than offset by the effect of lower base revenues. Operating income and margins decreased 15.3% and 1.7%, respectively, in 2008 versus 2007 primarily due to the revenue decline described above partially offset by the favorable effect of currency translation, lower restructuring charges and lower operating costs resulting from prior year restructuring projects and tight cost controls. 24 Table of Contents POLYMERS FLUIDS Businesses in this segment produce adhesives, sealants, lubrication and cutting fluids and hygiene products.

The results of operations for the Polymers Fluids segment for 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: Dollars in thousands 2009 2008 2007 Operating revenues $ 1,155,838 $ 1,249,653 $ 944,851 Operating income 70,396 180,040 158,813 Margin % 6.1 % 14.4 % 16.8 % In 2009 and 2008, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors: 2009 Compared to 2008 2008 Compared to 2007 % Point Increase % Point Increase % Increase (Decrease) (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) (Decrease) Operating Operating Operating Operating Operating Operating Revenues Income Margins Revenues Income Margins Base business: Revenue change/Operating leverage (12.4 )% (36.3 )% (3.9 )% (0.5 )% 0.6 % 0.2 % Changes in variable margins and overhead costs 22.4 3.7 (0.5 ) (0.1 ) (12.4 ) (13.9 ) (0.2 ) (0.5 ) 0.1 0.1 Acquisitions 11.0 (1.9 ) (1.2 ) 28.9 9.8 (2.6 ) Restructuring costs (4.4 ) (0.7 ) Impairment of goodwill and intangibles (33.4 ) (5.5 ) 0.5 0.1 Translation (6.1 ) (7.3 ) (0.7 ) 3.6 3.0 Other 0.3 (7.5 )% (60.9 )% (8.3 )% 32.3 % 13.4 % (2.4 )% Operating Revenues Revenues decreased 7.5% in 2009 versus 2008 due to lower base revenues and the unfavorable effect of currency translation partially offset by revenues from acquisitions. Acquisition revenue was primarily the result of the purchase of a pressure sensitive adhesives business and two construction adhesives businesses in 2008. Total base revenues declined 12.4% primarily due to continued weakness in worldwide industrial production and construction end markets. Worldwide base revenues for the fluids businesses declined 10.1% while base revenues for the polymers businesses declined 15.0% in 2009. Revenues increased 32.3% in 2008 over 2007 primarily due to revenues from acquisitions and the favorable effect of currency translation. Acquisition revenue was primarily the result of the purchase of two pressure 25 Table of Contents sensitive adhesives businesses, an international fluid products business, two polymers businesses, two North American construction adhesives businesses and a South American sealant business. Total base revenues were essentially flat as a 2.2% increase in worldwide polymers revenues was offset by a 3.6% decline in worldwide fluids revenues. Strong growth in North American polymers and industrial adhesives businesses, as well as increased demand in Brazil, India and China, was offset by substantially weaker demand for fluid products in North American and European industrial based end markets. Operating Income Operating income decreased 60.9% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily due to the decline in base revenues and a $60.0 million goodwill impairment charge against the pressure sensitive adhesives business in the first quarter of 2009. Base margins decreased 0.2% as favorable selling price versus material cost comparisons and the benefits of restructuring projects were more than offset by the effect of lower base revenues. The first quarter 2009 goodwill impairment charge reduced margins by 5.5%. Additionally, acquisitions diluted margins 1.2% for the year. Operating income increased 13.4% in 2008 over 2007 primarily due to income from acquisitions and the favorable effect of currency translation. Total operating margins declined 2.4% primarily due to the dilutive effect of the lower margins of acquired businesses. Variable margins decreased slightly due to higher material costs and unfavorable product mix, offset by overhead cost reductions. DECORATIVE SURFACES Businesses in this segment produce decorative surfacing materials for furniture, office and retail space, countertops, flooring and other applications. In the Decorative Surfaces segment, products include: decorative high pressure laminate for furniture, office and retail space, and countertops; high pressure laminate flooring; and high pressure laminate worktops.

The results of operations for the Decorative Surfaces segment for 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: Dollars in thousands 2009 2008 2007 Operating revenues $ 998,191 $ 1,230,995 $ 1,239,190 Operating income 113,727 142,582 160,973 Margin % 11.4 % 11.6 % 13.0 % 26 Table of Contents In 2009 and 2008, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors: 2009 Compared to 2008 2008 Compared to 2007 % Point Increase % Point Increase % Increase (Decrease) (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) (Decrease) Operating Operating Operating Operating Operating Operating Revenues Income Margins Revenues Income Margins Base business: Revenue change/Operating leverage (14.9 )% (51.4 )% (5.0 )% (3.1 )% (9.4 )% (0.8 )% Changes in variable margins and overhead costs 39.3 5.4 (2.7 ) (0.4 ) (14.9 ) (12.1 ) 0.4 (3.1 ) (12.1 ) (1.2 ) Acquisitions Restructuring costs (5.3 ) (0.7 ) (0.5 ) (0.1 ) Translation (4.0 ) (2.9 ) 0.2 2.5 1.2 (0.1 ) Other 0.1 (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (18.9 )% (20.2 )% (0.2 )% (0.7 )% (11.4 )% (1.4 )% Operating Revenues Revenues decreased 18.9% in 2009 versus 2008 due to lower base revenues and the unfavorable effect of currency translation. North American laminate base revenues declined 18.9% as a result of the continued downturn in North American commercial and residential construction. These declines were partially offset by product penetration in the premium high definition laminate product market. International base revenues declined 9.7% due to European volume declines. Revenues declined 0.7% in 2008 versus 2007 due to the decline in base revenues partially offset by the favorable effect of currency translation. North American laminate revenues decreased 3.4% as a result of laminate volume drop off in the second half of 2008 partially offset by a customer shift to higher priced premium products. Flooring revenues decreased 28.3% on steep volume declines. International laminate revenues decreased 2.0% over the prior year as new product introductions partially offset lower volumes. Operating Income Operating income decreased 20.2% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily due to the decline in base revenues, increased restructuring charges and the unfavorable effect of currency translation. Base margins increased 0.4% primarily due to favorable selling price versus material cost comparisons, benefits from restructuring projects and higher margins on the high definition laminate product, partially offset by the effect of lower base revenues. Operating income decreased 11.4% in 2008 versus 2007 primarily due to the negative leverage effect of the decline in base revenues described above. Lower selling expenses in 2008 versus 2007 were more than offset by significant raw material increases which contributed to an overall reduction in variable margins. Base margins declined 1.2% due to both the revenue decline and cost increases. ALL OTHER This segment includes all other operating segments.

The results of operations for the All Other segment for 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: Dollars in thousands 2009 2008 2007 Operating revenues $ 2,786,695 $ 3,226,927 $ 3,103,337 Operating income 389,629 590,613 590,035 Margin % 14.0 % 18.3 % 19.0 % In 2009 and 2008, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors: 2009 Compared to 2008 2008 Compared to 2007 % Point Increase % Point Increase % Increase (Decrease) (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) (Decrease) Operating Operating Operating Operating Operating Operating Revenues Income Margins Revenues Income Margins Base business: Revenue change/Operating leverage (17.5 )% (43.8 )% (5.8 )% (2.6 )% (6.7 )% (0.8 )% Changes in variable margins and overhead costs 17.6 3.9 3.3 0.6 (17.5 ) (26.2 ) (1.9 ) (2.6 ) (3.4 ) (0.2 ) Acquisitions and divestitures 7.4 2.0 (0.8 ) 4.3 1.6 (0.5 ) Restructuring costs (5.3 ) (1.2 ) (0.5 ) (0.1 ) Impairment of goodwill and intangibles (0.3 ) (0.1 ) Translation (3.6 ) (4.2 ) (0.3 ) 2.2 2.4 0.1 Other 0.1 0.1 (13.6 )% (34.0 )% (4.3 )% 4.0 % 0.1 % (0.7 )% Operating Revenues Revenues decreased 13.6% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily due to the decline in base business revenues and the unfavorable effect of currency translation, partially offset by an increase in revenues from acquired companies. The acquisition revenue was primarily related to the purchase of two test and measurement businesses in 2008. Base revenues declined 15.7%, 12.1%, 19.6% and 32.0%, for the test and measurement, consumer packaging, industrial plastics and metals and finishing businesses, respectively, due to negative industrial production trends and the related impact of weak end market and capital equipment demand across the broad spectrum of industries this segment serves. 28 Table of Contents Revenues increased 4.0% in 2008 versus 2007 primarily due to revenues from acquired companies and the favorable effect of currency translation partially offset by a decline in base revenues. The increase in acquisition revenue was primarily due to the purchase of three test and measurement businesses and a label business. Base revenues declined 7.8%, 3.2% and 3.0% for the industrial plastics and metals, consumer packaging and finishing businesses, respectively, due to a notable decrease in end market demand in the second half of the year. These decreases were partially offset by an 8.0% base business increase in test and measurement due to strong sales of equipment used in the materials and structural testing markets, particularly in Asia. Operating Income Operating income declined 34.0% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily due to the decline in base revenues described above, higher restructuring charges and the unfavorable effect of currency translation, partially offset by increased income from acquisitions. Base margins decreased 1.9% as favorable selling price versus material cost comparisons and benefits from restructuring projects were more than offset by the effect of lower base revenues. Additionally, acquisitions diluted total margins by 0.8%. Operating income was essentially flat in 2008 over 2007 primarily due to the negative leverage effect of the decrease in revenues described above, partially offset by the favorable effect of currency translation and income from acquired companies. Total operating margins declined 0.7% primarily due to lower margins for both base business and acquired businesses. Base operating margins decreased 0.2% as the gains from tight cost controls and the benefits of prior year restructuring projects were offset by the impact of lower revenues. AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS Amortization expense increased to $203.2 million in 2009 and $184.4 million in 2008, versus $145.7 million in 2007, due to intangible amortization related to newly acquired businesses. IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS Total goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges by segment for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: In Thousands 2009 2008 2007 Transportation $ 14,414 $ 13 $ 258 Industrial Packaging 386 Food Equipment 46 Power Systems Electronics 28,337 824 Construction Products 394 Polymers Fluids 60,416 251 884 All Other 1,969 487 618 $ 105,568 $ 1,575 $ 2,154 Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets increased to $105.6 million in 2009 versus $1.6 million in 2008, primarily due to goodwill impairment charges related to the pressure sensitive adhesives reporting unit of $60.0 million, the PC board fabrication reporting unit of $18.0 million and the truck remanufacturing and related parts and service reporting unit of $12.0 million.
