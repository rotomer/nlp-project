ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations INTRODUCTION Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the Company or ITW) is a multinational manufacturer of a diversified range of industrial products and equipment with operations in 57 countries. These businesses are internally reported as 60 operating segments to senior management. The Companys 60 operating segments have been aggregated into the following eight external reportable segments: Transportation; Industrial Packaging; Power Systems Electronics; Food Equipment; Construction Products; Polymers Fluids; Decorative Surfaces; and All Other. 14 Table of Contents Due to the large number of diverse businesses and the Companys highly decentralized operating style, the Company does not require its businesses to provide detailed information on operating results. Instead, the Companys corporate management collects data on several key measurements: operating revenues, operating income, operating margins, overhead costs, number of months on hand in inventory, days sales outstanding in accounts receivable, past due receivables and return on invested capital. These key measures are monitored by management and significant changes in operating results versus current trends in end markets and variances from forecasts are discussed with operating unit management. The results of each segment are analyzed by identifying the effects of changes in the results of the base businesses, newly acquired companies, restructuring costs, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, and currency translation on the operating revenues and operating income of each segment. Base businesses are those businesses that have been included in the Companys results of operations for more than 12 months. The changes to base business operating income include the estimated effects of both operating leverage and changes in variable margins and overhead costs. Operating leverage is the estimated effect of the base business revenue changes on operating income, assuming variable margins remain the same as the prior period. As manufacturing and administrative overhead costs usually do not significantly change as a result of revenues increasing or decreasing, the percentage change in operating income due to operating leverage is usually more than the percentage change in the base business revenues. A key element of the Companys business strategy is its continuous 80/20 business process for both existing businesses and new acquisitions. The basic concept of this 80/20 business process is to focus on what is most important (the 20% of the items which account for 80% of the value) and to spend less time and resources on the less important (the 80% of the items which account for 20% of the value). The Companys operations use this 80/20 business process to simplify and focus on the key parts of their business, and as a result, reduce complexity that often disguises what is truly important. The Companys operations utilize the 80/20 process in various aspects of their businesses. Common applications of the 80/20 business process include: Simplifying product lines by reducing the number of products offered by combining the features of similar products, outsourcing products or, as a last resort, eliminating low value products. Segmenting the customer base by focusing on the 80/20 customers separately and finding alternative ways to serve the 20/80 customers. Simplifying the supplier base by partnering with 80/20 suppliers and reducing the number of 20/80 suppliers. Designing business processes, systems and measurements around the 80/20 activities. The result of the application of this 80/20 business process is that the Company has over time improved its long term operating and financial performance. These 80/20 efforts can result in restructuring projects that reduce costs and improve margins. Corporate management works closely with those businesses that have operating results below expectations to help those businesses better apply this 80/20 business process and improve their results. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Companys consolidated results of operations for 2010, 2009 and 2008 are summarized as follows: Dollars in Thousands 2010 2009 2008 Operating revenues $ 15,870,376 $ 13,877,068 $ 17,100,341 Operating income 2,356,678 1,385,979 2,501,286 Margin % 14.8 % 10.0 % 14.6 % 15 Table of Contents In 2010 and 2009, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors: 2010 Compared to 2009 2009 Compared to 2008 % Point Increase % Point Increase % Increase (Decrease) (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) (Decrease) Operating Operating Operating Operating Operating Operating Revenues Income Margins Revenues Income Margins Base business: Revenue change/Operating leverage 10.8 % 44.2 % 3.0 % (18.4 )% (51.8 )% (6.0 )% Changes in variable margins and overhead costs 6.0 0.6 21.2 3.8 10.8 50.2 3.6 (18.4 ) (30.6 ) (2.2 ) Acquisitions and divestitures 3.0 1.9 (0.2 ) 4.2 (0.6 ) Restructuring costs 8.9 0.8 (4.1 ) (0.7 ) Impairment of goodwill and intangibles 7.5 0.7 (4.1 ) (0.7 ) Translation 0.8 1.5 (4.8 ) (5.8 ) (0.4 ) Other (0.2 ) (0.1 ) 0.2 14.4 % 70.0 % 4.8 % (18.8 )% (44.6 )% (4.6 )% Operating Revenues Revenues increased 14.4% in 2010 versus 2009 primarily due to higher base revenues and revenues from acquisitions. Base revenues increased 10.8% in 2010 versus 2009 as the Company saw improvement in macroeconomic indices across many geographies as worldwide end markets began to recover from the global recession. North American and international base revenues increased 10.9% and 10.4%, respectively, in 2010 versus 2009. End markets associated with transportation, welding, industrial packaging and PC board/electronics showed improvement in 2010. The company anticipates continued macroeconomic improvement in 2011. Revenues decreased 18.8% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily due to lower base revenues and the unfavorable effect of currency translation, mainly due to the strengthening of the dollar, partially offset by revenues from acquisitions. Total base revenues declined 18.4% in 2009 versus 2008. Base revenues declined 21.6% and 14.9% for North American and international businesses, respectively, as both were adversely affected by the global recession and weak industrial production in related end markets throughout 2009. Operating Income Operating income increased 70.0% in 2010 versus 2009 primarily due to the increase in base revenues, lower restructuring expenses, and 2009 goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. Base margins increased 360 basis points primarily due to positive leverage from the increase in base revenues. Additionally, benefits from restructuring projects were partially offset by unfavorable selling price versus material cost comparisons. Lower restructuring expenses in 2010 versus 2009 reflect the Companys 2009 efforts to reduce costs in response to weak economic conditions. In 2009, the Company recorded impairment charges of $90.0 million and $15.6 million against goodwill and intangibles, respectively, compared to $1.0 million in intangible asset impairment charges in 2010. Operating income declined 44.6% in 2009 versus 2008 due to the decline in base revenues, the negative effect of currency translation, increased restructuring expenses and increased goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. In 2009, the Company recorded impairment charges of $90.0 million and $15.6 million against goodwill and intangibles, respectively. The goodwill and intangible asset impairments were primarily related to new reporting units which were acquired over the last few years before the recent economic downturn. These charges were driven primarily by lower current forecasts compared to the expected 16 Table of Contents forecasts at the time the reporting units were acquired. The higher restructuring expenses reflected the Companys efforts to reduce costs in response to weak economic conditions. Improvements in base variable margins and lower overhead costs increased base margins 380 basis points in 2009, as the cumulative benefits of restructuring projects began to be realized and selling price versus material cost comparisons were favorable. Total margins declined by 460 basis points in 2009 primarily due to the declines in base revenues, restructuring expenses and the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. TRANSPORTATION Businesses in this segment produce components, fasteners, fluids and polymers, as well as truck remanufacturing and related parts and service.

Revenues decreased 26.4% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily due to lower base revenues and the unfavorable impact of currency translation. Base revenues declined 35.3% for the North American strapping businesses largely due to declines in consumable and equipment volume in key end markets such as primary metals, construction and general industrial. The international strapping businesses declined 25.6% due to the global decrease in industrial production activity. Worldwide stretch and protective packaging declined 13.8% and 1.3%, respectively. Operating Income Operating income increased 165.5% in 2010 versus 2009 primarily due to the increase in base revenues and lower restructuring expenses. Base operating margins increased 450 basis points primarily driven by leverage from the increase in base revenues and restructuring benefits, partially offset by unfavorable selling price versus material cost comparisons. Lower restructuring expenses compared to 2009 increased total operating margins by 130 basis points. Operating income decreased 68.4% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily due to the negative leverage effect of the decline in base revenues described above, the negative effect of currency translation and higher restructuring expenses. Base margins declined 460 basis points primarily due to the decline in base revenues discussed above, partially offset by favorable selling price versus material cost comparisons and reduced overhead costs as the benefits of restructuring projects began to be realized. 19 Table of Contents POWER SYSTEMS ELECTRONICS Businesses in this segment produce equipment and consumables associated with specialty power conversion, metallurgy and electronics.

European base revenues increased 8.4% in 2010 primarily due to improved market conditions. Base revenues for the Asia Pacific region increased 3.7% as market conditions in the Australian residential construction market improved. North American base revenues increased 1.8% primarily due to modest inventory restocking and a one time licensing agreement settlement in the second quarter of 2010 in the commercial construction business. The North American base business was negatively impacted by an 8% decline in U.S. housing starts on an annualized basis and an 18% decline in commercial construction square footage activity. Acquisition revenue was primarily the result of the purchase of a European business in the second quarter of 2010. Revenues declined 23.2% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily as a result of the decline in base revenues and the unfavorable effect of currency translation. Base revenues for the North American, European and Asia Pacific regions decreased 26.7%, 22.9% and 1.1%, respectively, primarily due to weakness in the residential and commercial construction markets in North America and Europe.

The Asia Pacific region outperformed other regions largely due to better customer activity in Australia and New Zealand. Operating Income Operating income increased 105.3% in 2010 versus 2009 primarily due to positive leverage from the increase in base revenues described above, lower operating expenses and the favorable effect of currency translation, partially offset by higher restructuring expenses. Base margins increased 540 basis points versus the prior year primarily due to the favorable leverage effect of the increase in base revenues, favorable selling price versus material cost comparisons, favorable inventory obsolescence expense comparisons, benefits from restructuring projects and a favorable one time licensing agreement settlement in the second quarter of 2010 in the commercial construction business. Operating income decreased 60.0% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily due to the base revenue decline described above. In addition, the unfavorable effect of currency translation and higher restructuring expenses contributed to the lower income and margins. Base margins declined 430 basis points as reduced operating expenses, including favorable selling price versus material cost comparisons and benefits from restructuring projects, were more than offset by the effect of lower base revenues. POLYMERS FLUIDS Businesses in this segment produce adhesives, sealants, lubrication and cutting fluids and hygiene products.
