Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Overview The following executive overview summarizes the significant trends affecting our results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented. This overview and the remainder of this managements discussion and analysis supplements, and should be read in conjunction with, the Consolidated Financial Statements of Invesco Ltd. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the company or Invesco) and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Global equity markets declined in the three months and year ended December 31, 2008, and continued to fall during the month of January 2009, as illustrated in the table below: Index Three Months Ended December 31, 2008 Year Ended December 31, 2008 Month Ended January 31, 2009 Dow Jones Industrial Average (18.38)% (31.93)% (8.65)% S&P 500 (21.84)% (37.00)% (8.43)% NASDAQ Composite Index (24.37)% (39.98)% (6.35)% S&P/TSX Composite (Canada) (22.71)% (33.01)% (2.96)% FTSE 100 (8.56)% (27.99)% (6.34)% FTSE World Europe (22.00)% (43.17)% (3.88)% China SE Shanghai Composite (20.60)% (64.89)% 9.33% Nikkei 225 (21.24)% (41.14)% (9.76)% Lehman Brothers U.S. Aggregate Bond Index 4.58% 5.24% (0.88)% 2008 was an extremely challenging period in the financial markets. The financial crisis began in 2007 with the subprime mortgage collapse that continued into 2008. Financial institutions that held mortgage backed securities on their balance sheets took a series of write downs that led to lower market liquidity and the collapse or consolidation of several major financial firms. Heightened risk perceptions ultimately led to systematic deleveraging across the global markets as investors moved out of risky assets. Events in these periods were dominated by challenges in the credit markets. Many financial institutions had difficulty securing short term funding as liquidity rapidly contracted. With banks unable to obtain funding and reluctant to lend, interbank rates rose both absolutely and relative to central bank policy rates. Government bonds benefited from a flight to quality, particularly short dated issues. This also led to a strengthening of the U.S. dollar from July until November as U.S. investors unwound carry trades and repatriated funds, and non U.S. investors increasingly purchased U.S. government issues. Further, credit spreads widened sharply, particularly for financials, and economic growth around the world slowed under the impact of the credit squeeze. Global manufacturing orders slumped as business and consumer confidence waned. Emerging markets saw weakening demand for both exported goods and commodities. Asian markets also experienced lower export demand with concerns about inflation becoming secondary to economic growth. Several major global market indices declined by historic amounts: the Dow Jones Industrial Average saw its worst year since 1931, the S&P 500 had its worst year since 1937, Japans Nikkei Average saw its biggest decline ever, and the FTSE 100s decline ranks as its worst year since it was created in 1985. In response to the market disruptions, governments and central banks have acted to help revive credit markets and restore stability in the financial system. These actions include direct and indirect support of financial institutions, the imposition of short selling restrictions, easing of monetary policy, and the guaranteeing of certain financial instruments. The U.S. Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate target seven times during 2008, from 4.25% at the beginning of the year to setting a target rate of 0% to 0.25% in December, a historic low. Despite these actions, the equity and credit markets continue to operate under considerable pressure. A significant portion of our business and managed AUM are based outside of the U.S. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, primarily the Pound Sterling and the Canadian dollar, will impact our reported revenues and expenses from period to period. Additionally, our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our AUM. Therefore, movements in global capital market levels, net new business inflows (or outflows) and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period. The returns from most global capital markets declined in the three months and year ended December 31, 2008, which contributed to declines in AUM of $52.4 billion and $142.9 billion during the respective periods. 24 Assuming a continuation of year end 2008 market and foreign exchange levels, Invesco expects to decrease 2009 total operating expenses by $450 million, or 17.6%, to $2,110 million from $2,560 million in 2008. This reduction is comprised of three components: (1) 48% of the reduction is expected to be realized from decreases in third party distribution, service and advisory expenses, which naturally decline with AUM levels; (2) 35% of the reduction is expected to be realized from decreases in employee compensation expenses; and (3) 17% of the reduction is expected to be realized from declines in other expenses, including general and administrative, marketing and property, office and technology expenses. As part of the $450 million expense reduction, we expect $140 million in savings to be generated from our continued movement towards global operating platforms, further use of our low cost enterprise centers, managing discretionary spending, continued leverage of our centers of expertise on a global basis, and managing our staff expenses. We will also continue to reinvest in our business in 2009, targeting $35 million of incremental cost (which is included in the $450 million total reduction) in 2009 versus 2008, including investments in our private equity business, exchange traded funds, common technology platforms, and building out our institutional sales and client service group. We expect to incur transition expenses of approximately $15 million (also included in the $450 million) in order to achieve the planned savings. Summary operating information for 2008 and 2007 is presented in the table below. Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 Operating revenues $3,307.6m $3,878.9m Net revenues(1) $2,489.4m $2,888.4m Operating margin 22.6% 25.6% Net operating margin(2) 31.6% 36.0% Net income $481.7m $673.6m Diluted EPS $1.21 $1.64 Average assets under management (in billions) $440.6 $489.1 (1) Net revenues are operating revenues less third party distribution, service and advisory expenses plus our proportional share of the net revenues of our joint venture investments.

Includes assets with a minimum 1 year composite track record and populated benchmark return (for % assets ahead of benchmark) or peer group (for % assets in top half of peer group). AUM measured in the one , three , and five year peer group rankings represents 66%, 65%, and 58% of total Invesco AUM, respectively, and AUM measured versus benchmark on a one , three , and five year basis represents 82%, 78%, and 74% of total Invesco AUM, respectively, as of 12/31/08. Excludes Invesco PowerShares, stable value, alternatives, W.L. Ross & Co., Invesco Private Capital, direct real estate products and CLOs. Certain funds and products were excluded from the analysis because of limited benchmark or peer group data. Had these been available, results may have been different. These results are preliminary and subject to revision. Performance assumes the reinvestment of dividends. Past performance is not indicative of future results and may not reflect an investors experience. Invescos first strategic priority is to achieve strong investment performance over the long term for our clients. Performance in our equities capabilities, as measured by the percentage of AUM ahead of benchmark and ahead of peer median, is generally strong with some pockets of outstanding performance and some areas where we have been challenged. Within our equity asset class, U.S. Core, U.K., Asian, European, and Global ex U.S. and Emerging Markets have had strong relative performance versus competitors and versus benchmark over one , three and five year periods. Investment performance in our U.S. Value equities has lagged while our Canadian equity one and three year year performance has sharply improved. Within our fixed income and balanced asset classes, the global fixed income products have had at least 58% of AUM ahead of benchmark and peers over one , three , and five year periods; the balanced products were largely ahead of peers and benchmarks; and the U.S. fixed income products had at least 55% of AUM ahead of peers. Our money market capability had at least 95% of AUM ahead of peers on a one , three , and five year basis while performance versus benchmark was tempered as some of the larger products underperformed their respective benchmarks by anywhere from 1 to 24 basis points. 26 Assets Under Management AUM at December 31, 2008, were $357.2 billion, compared to $500.1 billion at December 31, 2007. The decline in AUM during the year was due to $102.8 billion in reduced market values, $26.6 billion impact of less favorable foreign exchange rates, and total net outflows of $13.5 billion (long term net flows plus net flows in institutional money market funds). Average AUM for 2008 were $440.6 billion, compared to $489.1 billion in 2007. Our retail total net outflows for 2008 were $10.6 billion, compared to total net inflows of $5.7 billion in 2007. Institutional net outflows were $3.1 billion in 2008, compared to total net inflows of $1.2 billion in 2007 (including Stable Value net outflows of $16.2 billion in 2007 attributable to the departure of employees to a competitor). Our Private Wealth Management (PWM) channel had total net inflows of $0.2 billion in 2008 compared to total net outflows of $0.2 billion in 2007.

Results of Operations Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2008, Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2007 Operating Revenues and Net Revenues Operating revenues decreased by 14.7% in 2008 to $3,307.6 million (2007: $3,878.9 million). Net revenues are operating revenues less third party distribution, service and advisory expenses, plus our proportional share of net revenues from joint venture arrangements. Net revenues decreased by 13.8% in 2008 to $2,489.4 million (2007: $2,888.4 million). See Schedule of Non GAAP Information for additional important disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. The main categories of revenues, and the dollar and percentage change between the periods, are as follows: $ in millions 2008 2007 $ Change % Change Investment management fees 2,617.8 3,080.1 (462.3) (15.0) Performance fees 75.1 70.3 4.8 6.8 Service and distribution fees 512.5 593.1 (80.6) (13.6) Other 102.2 135.4 (33.2) (24.5) Total operating revenues 3,307.6 3,878.9 (571.3) (14.7) Third party distribution, service and advisory expenses (875.5) (1,051.1) 175.6 (16.7) Proportional share of revenues, net of third party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments 57.3 60.6 (3.3) (5.4) Net revenues 2,489.4 2,888.4 (399.0) (13.8) 30 Investment Management Fees Investment management fees are derived from providing professional services to manage client accounts and include fees received from retail mutual funds, unit trusts, investment companies with variable capital (ICVCs), exchange traded funds, investment trusts and institutional and private wealth management advisory contracts. Investment management fees for products offered in the retail distribution channel are generally calculated as a percentage of the daily average asset balances and therefore vary as the levels of AUM change resulting from inflows, outflows and market movements. Investment management fees for products offered in the institutional and private wealth management distribution channels are calculated in accordance with the underlying investment management contracts and also vary in relation to the level of client assets managed. Investment management fees decreased 15.0% in 2008 to $2,617.8 million (2007: $3,080.1 million) due to decreases in average AUM during the year and the mix of AUM between various asset classes. Average AUM for the year ended December 31, 2008, were $440.6 billion (2007: $489.1 billion), a decrease of 9.9%. Average long term AUM, which generally earn higher fee rates than institutional money market AUM, for the year ended December 31, 2008, were $360.8 billion, a decrease of 14.9% from $424.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007, while average institutional money market AUM increased 23.0% to $79.8 billion at December 31, 2008, from $64.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. In addition, our equity AUM as a percentage of total AUM fell from 49% at December 31, 2007, to 36% at December 31, 2008. This decline in equities within our asset mix is consistent with the decline in global equity markets. Performance Fees Performance fee revenues are generated on certain management contracts when performance hurdles are achieved. They are recorded in operating revenues as of the performance measurement date, when the contractual performance criteria have been met. The performance measurement date is defined in each contract in which incentive and performance fee revenue agreements are in effect. If performance arrangements require repayment of the performance fee for failure to perform during the contractual period, then performance fee revenues are recognized no earlier than the expiration date of these terms and no later than the first date of performance measurement after the expiration of these terms. Performance fees will fluctuate from period to period and may not correlate with general market changes, since most of the fees are driven by relative performance to the respective benchmark rather than absolute performance. In 2008, these fees increased 6.8% to $75.1 million (2007: $70.3 million). The performance fees generated in 2008 arose primarily in the Invesco Quantitative Strategies and Real Estate groups, as well as in the U.K.; whereas the performance fees generated in 2007 included amounts generated primarily in the U.K. and Asia. Service and Distribution Fees Service fees are generated through fees charged to cover several types of expenses, including fund accounting fees and other maintenance costs for mutual funds, unit trusts and ICVCs, and administrative fees earned from closed ended funds. Service fees also include transfer agent fees, which are fees charged to cover the expense of processing client share purchases and redemptions, call center support and client reporting. U.S. distribution fees can include 12b 1 fees earned from certain mutual funds to cover allowable sales and marketing expenses for those funds and also include asset based sales charges paid by certain mutual funds for a period of time after the sale of those funds. Distribution fees typically vary in relation to the amount of client assets managed. Generally, retail products offered outside of the U.S. do not generate a separate distribution fee, as the quoted management fee rate is inclusive of these services. In 2008, service and distribution fees decreased 13.6% to $512.5 million (2007: $593.1 million) primarily due to decreased retail AUM, offset by increases in institutional money market revenues resulting from the 23.0% increase in average institutional money market AUM during the year. Other Revenues Other revenues include fees derived primarily from transaction commissions earned upon the sale of new investments into certain of our retail funds and fees earned upon the completion of transactions in our real estate and private equity assets groups. Real estate transaction fees are derived from commissions earned through the buying and selling of properties. Private equity transaction fees include commissions associated with the restructuring of and fees from providing advice to portfolio companies held by the funds. The 31 measurement date in which these transaction fees are recorded is the date on which the transaction is legally closed. Other revenues also include the revenues of consolidated investment products. In 2008, other revenues decreased 24.5% to $102.2 million (2007: $135.4 million) driven by decreases in sales volumes of funds subject to front end commissions, offset by higher transaction fees within our private equity business. Third Party Distribution, Service and Advisory Expenses Third party distribution, service and advisory expenses include renewal commissions paid to independent financial advisors for as long as the clients assets are invested and are payments for the servicing of client accounts. Renewal commissions are calculated based upon a percentage of the AUM value. Third party distribution expenses also include the amortization of upfront commissions paid to broker dealers for sales of fund shares with a contingent deferred sales charge (a charge levied to the investor for client redemption of AUM within a certain contracted period of time). The distribution commissions are amortized over the redemption period. Also included in third party distribution, service and advisory expenses are sub transfer agency fees that are paid to third parties for processing client share purchases and redemptions, call center support and client reporting. Third party distribution, service and advisory expenses may increase or decrease at a rate different from the rate of change in service and distribution fee revenues due to the inclusion of distribution, service and advisory expenses for the U.K. and Canada, where the related revenues are recorded as investment management fee revenues, as noted above. Third party distribution, service and advisory expenses decreased 16.7% in 2008 to $875.5 million (2007: $1,051.1 million), consistent with the declines in investment management and service and distribution fee revenues. Proportional share of revenues, net of third party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments Management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues, net of third party distribution expenses, from joint venture arrangements should be added to operating revenues to arrive at net revenues, as it is important to evaluate the contribution to the business that our joint venture arrangements are making. See Schedule of Non GAAP Information for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. The companys most significant joint venture arrangement, as identified in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &mdash; Note 4, Investments, is our 49.0% investment in Invesco Great Wall Fund Management Company Limited (the Invesco Great Wall joint venture). In September 2008, the company entered into a 50% joint venture with Huaneng Capital Services, a subsidiary of China Huaneng Group (the largest power producer in China), to form Huaneng Invesco WLR Investment Consulting Company Ltd. This joint venture will assess private equity investment opportunities in power generation in China. The 5.4% decrease in our proportional share of revenues, net of third party distribution expenses, to $57.3 million in 2008 (2007: $60.6 million), is driven by the declines in average AUM in the Invesco Great Wall joint venture. Our share of the Invesco Great Wall joint ventures AUM at December 31, 2008, was $3.0 billion, a 58% decline in AUM from $7.1 billion at December 31, 2007, reflecting the increased volatility of equity markets in this region during the year. Operating Expenses During 2008, operating expenses decreased 11.3% to $2,559.8 million (2007: $2,884.6 million), reflecting declines in all cost categories from 2007 expense levels. The main categories of operating expenses are as follows: $ in millions 2008 2007 $ Change % Change Employee compensation 1,055.8 1,137.6 (81.8) (7.2) Third party distribution, service and advisory 875.5 1,051.1 (175.6) (16.7) Marketing 148.2 157.6 (9.4) (6.0) Property, office and technology 214.3 242.5 (28.2) (11.6) General and administrative 266.0 295.8 (29.8) (10.1) Total operating expenses 2,559.8 2,884.6 (324.8) (11.3) 32 The table below sets forth these expense categories as a percentage of total operating expenses and operating revenues, which we believe provides useful information as to the relative significance of each type of expense. $ in millions 2008 % of Total Operating Expenses % of Operating Revenues 2007 % of Total Operating Expenses % of Operating Revenues Employee compensation 1,055.8 41.2% 31.9% 1,137.6 39.4% 29.3% Third party distribution, service and advisory 875.5 34.2% 26.5% 1,051.1 36.4% 27.1% Marketing 148.2 5.8% 4.5% 157.6 5.5% 4.1% Property, office and technology 214.3 8.4% 6.5% 242.5 8.4% 6.3% General and administrative 266.0 10.4% 8.0% 295.8 10.3% 7.6% Total operating expenses 2,559.8 100.0% 77.4% 2,884.6 100.0% 74.4% Employee Compensation Employee compensation includes salary, cash bonuses and share based payment plans designed to attract and retain the highest caliber employees. Employee compensation decreased $81.8 million, or 7.2%, in 2008 from 2007 due predominantly to overall decreases in sales commissions and variable compensation. Offsetting these declines were increases in base salary expenses resulting from annual merit increases, which were effective March 1, 2008. Additionally, in the three months ended December 31, 2008, the company experienced increases in bonus expense tied to improved investment performance and performance fee revenues. These increases in bonus expense during the three months ended December 31, 2008, which incorporated recognition of a full year impact tied to investment performance improvements, were equally offset in the three months ended December 31, 2008, by the reversal of $18.8 million ($12.6 million, net of tax, or $0.5 per share) of cumulative share based compensation charges related to performance based share awards granted in 2007. The reversal was made because the company does not expect that the required performance targets for the vesting of these awards will be achieved. Of the charges reversed, $10.8 million was originally recorded in 2007, with the remainder originally recorded in the first nine months of 2008. Third Party Distribution, Service and Advisory Expenses Third party distribution, service and advisory expenses are discussed above in the operating and net revenues section. Marketing Marketing expenses include marketing support payments, which are payments made to distributors of certain of our retail products over and above the 12b 1 distribution payments. These fees are contracted separately with each distributor. Marketing expenses also include the cost of direct advertising of our products through trade publications, television and other media, and public relations costs, such as the marketing of the companys products through conferences or other sponsorships, and the cost of marketing related employee travel. Marketing expenses decreased 6.0% in 2008 to $148.2 million (2007: $157.6 million) due to decreased marketing support payments related to decreased sales and AUM in the U.S., consistent with overall market declines during the period. Property, Office and Technology Property, office and technology expenses include rent and utilities for our various leased facilities, depreciation of company owned property and capitalized computer equipment costs, minor non capitalized computer equipment and software purchases and related maintenance payments, and costs related to externally provided operations, technology, and other back office management services. Property, office and technology costs decreased 11.6% to $214.3 million in 2008 from $242.5 million in 2007, due primarily to reduced depreciation charges reflecting longer useful lives for certain global technology initiatives. During the three months ended December 31, 2008, charges of $5.1 million were recorded related to vacating leased property; however these charges were offset during the year by downward adjustments in rent costs for sublet office property of $8.2 million. Rent expense during the year ended December 31, 2007, included a $7.4 million charge related to vacating leased property. 33 General and Administrative General and administrative expenses include professional services costs, such as information service subscriptions, consulting fees, professional insurance costs, audit, tax and legal fees, non marketing related employee travel expenditures, recruitment and training costs, and the amortization of certain intangible assets. General and administrative expenses decreased by $29.8 million (10.1%) to $266.0 million in 2008 from $295.8 million in 2007. During the three months ended December 31, 2007, we recorded $12.8 million of expense related to the relisting of the company on the New York Stock Exchange and a $9.8 million charge related to the proposed final settlement of market timing private litigation that commenced in 2003. Operating Income, Net Operating Income, Operating Margin and Net Operating Margin Operating income decreased 24.8% to $747.8 million in 2008 from $994.3 million in 2007, driven by the declines in operating revenues from reduced AUM. Operating margin (operating income divided by operating revenues) was 22.6% in 2008, down from 25.6% in 2007. Net operating income (operating income plus our proportional share of the operating income from joint venture arrangements) decreased 24.3% to $787.5 million in 2008 from $1,039.8 million in 2007. Net operating margin is equal to net operating income divided by net revenues. Net revenues are equal to operating revenues less third party distribution, service and advisory expenses, plus our proportional share of the net revenues from our joint venture arrangements. Net operating margin was 31.6% in 2008, down from 36.0% in 2007. See Schedule of Non GAAP Information for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues, a reconciliation of operating income to net operating income and additional important disclosures regarding net revenues, net operating income and net operating margins. Other Income and Expenses Interest income decreased 23.3% to $37.2 million in 2008 from $48.5 million in 2007 due to the combination of lower interest rates and lower average cash and cash equivalents balances in 2008. The decrease in yields was consistent with the market movement from 2007 to 2008. Interest expense increased 7.9% to $76.9 million in 2008 from $71.3 million in 2007 due to increases in the average debt balance in 2008, which were only partially offset by lower debt costs in 2008. Other gains and losses, net were a net loss of $39.9 million in 2008, compared to a net gain of $9.9 million in 2007. The 2008 net loss included $22.7 million in other than temporary impairment charges related to the valuations of investments in certain of our CLO products (2007: $5.4 million) and $8.5 million in other than temporary impairment charges related to other seed money in affiliated funds (2007: $0 million). The impairment of the CLO products arose principally from increases in discount rates and extended cash flow projections used in the valuation models, and the impairment of the seed money arose principally due to extended declines in market values of the underlying funds. $14.2 million of the combined impairment charges arose during the three months ended December 31, 2008. Included in other gains and losses, net are net gains on disposals of investments of $4.3 million in 2008 (2007: $24.0 million), primarily driven by a gain of $7.4 realized upon the maturity of a CLO product in which the company had invested. Also included in other losses are net foreign exchange losses, primarily associated with long term intercompany financing. In the year ended December 31, 2008, we incurred $13.0 million in net foreign exchange losses (2007: $10.3 million), largely the result of the weakening of the Pound Sterling to the Euro and U.S. dollar in the three months ended December 31, 2008. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &mdash; Note 14, Other Gains and Losses, Net, for additional details related to other gains and losses. Included in other income and expenses are net realized and unrealized gains of consolidated investment products. In 2008, the net losses of consolidated investment products were $58.0 million, compared to net gains of $214.3 million in 2007, reflecting the changes in market values of the investments held by consolidated investment products and the deconsolidation of certain variable interest entities for which we determined that we were no longer the primary beneficiary. Invesco invests in a small equity portion of these products, and as a result the majority of these gains and losses are offset by minority interests. 34 Income Tax Expense Our subsidiaries operate in several taxing jurisdictions around the world, each with its own statutory income tax rate. As a result, our effective tax rate will vary from year to year depending on the mix of the profits and losses of our subsidiaries. The majority of our profits are earned in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. The current U.K. statutory tax rate is 28.0%, the Canadian statutory tax rate is 33.5% and the U.S. Federal statutory tax rate is 35.0%. The U.K.s tax rate decreased from 30% to 28.0% effective April 1, 2008. On December 14, 2007, legislation was enacted to reduce the Canadian income tax rate over five years. Beginning January 1, 2008, the Canadian rate was reduced to 33.5%, with further reductions to 33.0% in 2009, 32.0% in 2010, 30.5% in 2011, and finally 29.0% in 2012. Our effective tax rate excluding minority interest for 2008 was 32.9%, as compared to 34.6% in 2007. The decrease related primarily to a net reduction in our FIN 48 reserves, lower state taxes, and reduced taxes on subsidiary dividends in excess of an increase in the net valuation allowance for subsidiary operating losses and certain investment write downs that did not give rise to tax benefits. Our effective tax rate, after minority interests, increased to 52.9% for the three months ended December 31, 2008, largely as a result of the investment write downs. 2007 included a reduction in our Canadian and U.K. deferred tax assets to reflect the tax rate changes discussed above and transaction costs associated with our change in listing and domicile that were not deductible for tax purposes. The inclusion of income from minority interests increased our effective tax rate to 35.9% in 2008 and reduced it to 28.7% in 2007. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2007, Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2006 Operating Revenues and Net Revenues Operating revenues increased by 19.5% in 2007 to $3,878.9 million (2006: $3,246.7 million). Net revenues are operating revenues less third party distribution, service and advisory expenses, plus our proportional share of net revenues from joint venture arrangements. Net revenues increased by 19.0% in 2007 to $2,888.4 million (2006: $2,428.0 million). See Schedule of Non GAAP Information for additional important disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. The main categories of revenues, and the dollar and percentage change between the periods, are as follows: $ in millions 2007 2006 $ Change % Change Investment management fees 3,080.1 2,508.2 571.9 22.8 Performance fees 70.3 82.1 (11.8) (14.4) Service and distribution fees 593.1 534.9 58.2 10.9 Other 135.4 121.5 13.9 11.4 Total operating revenues 3,878.9 3,246.7 632.2 19.5 Third party distribution, service and advisory expenses (1,051.1) (826.8) (224.3) (27.1) Proportional share of revenues, net of third party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments 60.6 8.1 52.5 648.1 Net revenues 2,888.4 2,428.0 460.4 19.0 Investment Management Fees Investment management fees increased 22.8% in 2007 to $3,080.1 million (2006: $2,508.2 million) due to increases in AUM during the year. AUM at December 31, 2007, were $500.1 billion (2006: $462.6 billion). Performance Fees Performance fees will fluctuate from period to period and may not correlate with general market changes, since most of the fees are driven by relative performance to the respective benchmark rather than absolute performance. In 2007, these fees decreased 14.4% to $70.3 million (2006: $82.1 million). The performance fees generated in 2006 were the result of outstanding investment performance across a number of our investment disciplines. 35 Service and Distribution Fees In 2007, service and distribution fees increased 10.9% to $593.1 million (2006: $534.9 million) due to increased sales and AUM. Other Revenues In 2007, other revenues increased 11.4% to $135.4 million (2006: $121.5 million) driven by increases in sales volumes of funds subject to front end commissions, offset by declines in real estate transaction fees from 2006. Increases in other revenues were also offset by decreases in the revenues of consolidated investment products, which were primarily the result of the deconsolidation of certain variable interest entities following the companys determination that it was no longer the primary beneficiary of those entities in 2007. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &mdash; Note 17, Consolidated Investment Products. Third Party Distribution, Service and Advisory Expenses Third party distribution, service and advisory expenses increased 27.1% in 2007 to $1,051.1 million (2006: $826.8 million), driven by increased renewal commissions generated by increased AUM. Additionally, the trend towards platform and fund supermarket sales in the U.K. has further contributed to the increase in these expenses. Proportional share of revenues, net of third party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments The 648.1% increase in our proportional share of revenues, net of third party distribution expenses, to $60.6 million in 2007 (2006: $8.1 million), is driven by the significant growth in AUM in our 49% joint venture investment in Invesco Great Wall Fund Management Company Limited. Operating Expenses During 2007, operating expenses increased 16.0% to $2,884.6 million (2006: $2,487.5 million), driven by increases in employee compensation, third party distribution, service and advisory expenses and general and administrative expenses. The main categories of operating expenses are as follows: $ in millions 2007 2006 $ Change % Change Employee compensation 1,137.6 1,070.5 67.1 6.3 Third party distribution, service and advisory 1,051.1 826.8 224.3 27.1 Marketing 157.6 138.8 18.8 13.5 Property, office and technology 242.5 230.7 11.8 5.1 General and administrative 295.8 207.6 88.2 42.5 Restructuring charge &mdash; 13.1 (13.1) (100.0) Total operating expenses 2,884.6 2,487.5 397.1 16.0 The table below sets forth these expense categories as a percentage of total operating expenses and operating revenues, which we believe provides useful information as to the relative significance of each type of expenses. $ in millions 2007 % of Total Operating Expenses % of Operating Revenues 2006 % of Total Operating Expenses % of Operating Revenues Employee compensation 1,137.6 39.4% 29.3% 1,070.5 43.0% 33.0% Third party distribution, service and advisory 1,051.1 36.4% 27.1% 826.8 33.2% 25.5% Marketing 157.6 5.5% 4.1% 138.8 5.6% 4.3% Property, office and technology 242.5 8.4% 6.3% 230.7 9.3% 7.1% General and administrative 295.8 10.3% 7.6% 207.6 8.3% 6.4% Restructuring charge &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; 13.1 0.6% 0.4% Total operating expenses 2,884.6 100.0% 74.4% 2,487.5 100.0% 76.7% 36 Employee Compensation Employee compensation increased $67.1 million, or 6.3%, in 2007 from 2006 due predominantly to increases in base salaries, sales incentive bonuses and staff bonuses for performance against corporate objectives, and $25.0 million in amortization related to a component of the cost of the October 2006 acquisition of WL Ross & Co., which was accounted for as prepaid compensation (see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &mdash; Note 2, Acquisitions). Third Party Distribution, Service and Advisory Expenses Third party distribution, service and advisory expenses are discussed above in the operating and net revenues section. Marketing Marketing expenses increased 13.5% in 2007 to $157.6 million (2006: $138.8 million) due to increased marketing support payments related to increased sales and AUM in the U.S. Property, Office and Technology Property, office and technology costs increased 5.1% to $242.5 million in 2007 from $230.7 million in 2006, due primarily to a $7.4 million lease charge related to vacating leased property. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses increased by $88.2 million (42.5%) to $295.8 million in 2007 from $207.6 million in 2006. This increase included growth in legal and other costs related to a $24.0 million insurance recovery in 2006 and to fund launch costs for a broad array of new ETF products through PowerShares. In addition, during the three months ended December 31, 2007, we recorded $12.8 million of expense related to the relisting of the company on the New York Stock Exchange and a $9.8 million charge related to the proposed final settlement of market timing private litigation that commenced in 2003. Restructuring Charge We did not incur any restructuring costs in 2007. In 2006, we recorded $13.1 million in remaining charges related to the operational restructuring efforts that began in 2005. Operating Income, Net Operating Income, Operating Margin and Net Operating Margin Operating income increased 31.0% to $994.3 million in 2007 from $759.2 million in 2006, driven by the growth in operating revenues. Operating margin (operating income divided by operating revenues) was 25.6% in 2007, up from 23.4% in 2006. Net operating income (operating income plus our proportional share of the operating income from joint venture arrangements) increased 36.4% to $1,039.8 million in 2007 from $762.1 million in 2006. Net operating margin is equal to net operating income divided by net revenues. Net revenues are equal to operating revenues less third party distribution, service and advisory expenses, plus our proportional share of the net revenues from our joint venture arrangements. Net operating margin was 36.0% in 2007, up from 31.4% in 2006. See Schedule of Non GAAP Information for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues, a reconciliation of operating income to net operating income and additional important disclosures regarding net revenues, net operating income and net operating margins. Other Income and Expenses Interest income increased 80.3% to $48.5 million in 2007 from $26.9 million in 2006 largely as a result of growth in our interest earning cash balances during the year. Interest expense decreased 7.6% to $71.3 million in 2007 from $77.2 million in 2006 due to lower credit facility balances and a lower coupon interest rate on the new senior notes issued in April 2007. 37 Other gains and losses, net decreased 63.1% to $9.9 million in 2007 from $26.8 million in 2006. Included in other gains and losses, net are gains on disposals of investments, which increased to $32.2 million in 2007 from $18.1 million in 2006, primarily driven by gains realized upon the redemption of seed money investments, offset by a loss of $8.2 million incurred upon the liquidation of a fund investment. Also included in other gains and losses, net are net foreign exchange gains and losses. In 2007, we incurred $10.3 million in net foreign exchange losses; whereas in 2006 we benefited from $8.5 million in net foreign exchange gains. Additionally, we incurred $5.4 million in write downs and losses on certain CLO investments during 2007 (2006: $1.7 million). See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &mdash; Note 14, Other Gains and Losses, Net, for additional details related to other gains and losses. Included in other income and expenses are net other realized and unrealized gains of consolidated investment products. These net gains decreased 27.2% to $214.3 million in 2007 from $294.3 million in 2006, primarily due to the deconsolidation of certain variable interest entities for which we determined that we were no longer the primary beneficiary. Income Tax Expense Our subsidiaries operate in several taxing jurisdictions around the world, each with its own statutory income tax rate. As a result, our effective tax rate will vary from year to year depending on the mix of the profits and losses of our subsidiaries. The majority of our profits are earned in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. The U.K. statutory tax rate was 30.0%, the Canadian statutory tax rate was 36.0% and the U.S. Federal statutory tax rate was 35.0% for both 2007 and 2006. The U.K.s tax rate decreased from 30% to 28.0% effective April 1, 2008. On December 14, 2007, legislation was enacted to reduce the Canadian income tax rate over five years. Beginning January 1, 2008, the Canadian tax rate will be reduced to 33.5%, with further reductions to 33.0% in 2009, 32.0% in 2010, 30.5% in 2011, and finally 29.0% in 2012. Our effective tax rate excluding minority interest for 2007 was 34.6%, as compared to 34.5% in 2006. In 2007 a larger percentage of our profits originated from the U.K. than in 2006, which further decreased our effective tax rate. Similar to 2006, this reduction was offset by state taxes, additional taxes on subsidiary dividends, and an increase in the net valuation allowance for subsidiary operating losses. In 2007, we also reduced our Canadian and U.K. deferred tax assets to reflect the tax rate changes discussed above and we incurred transaction costs associated with our change in listing and domicile that were not deductible for tax purposes. The inclusion of income from minority interests reduced our effective tax rate to 28.7% in 2007 and 24.6% in 2006. Schedule of Non GAAP Information Net revenues, net operating income and net operating margin are non GAAP financial measures. The most comparable U.S. GAAP measures are operating revenues, operating income and operating margin. Management believes that the deduction of third party distribution, service and advisory expenses from operating revenues in the computation of net revenues and the related computation of net operating margin provides useful information to investors because the distribution, service and advisory fee amounts represent costs that are passed through to external parties, which essentially are a share of the related revenues. Management also believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues, net of distribution expenses, from joint venture investments in the computation of net revenues and the addition of our proportional share of operating income in the related computations of net operating income and net operating margin also provide useful information to investors, as management considers it appropriate to evaluate the contribution of its joint venture investment to the operations of the business. Net revenues, net operating income and net operating margin should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. 38 The following is a reconciliation of operating revenues, operating income and operating margin on a U.S. GAAP basis to net revenues, net operating income and net operating margin. Years Ended December 31, $ in millions 2008 2007 2006 Operating revenues, GAAP basis 3,307.6 3,878.9 3,246.7 Third party distribution, service and advisory expenses (875.5) (1,051.1) (826.8) Proportional share of revenues, net of third party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments 57.3 60.6 8.1 Net revenues 2,489.4 2,888.4 2,428.0 Operating income, GAAP basis 747.8 994.3 759.2 Proportional share of operating income from joint venture investments 39.7 45.5 2.9 Net operating income 787.5 1,039.8 762.1 Operating margin* 22.6% 25.6% 23.4% Net operating margin** 31.6% 36.0% 31.4% * Operating margin is equal to operating income divided by operating revenues. ** Net operating margin is equal to net operating income divided by net revenues. Balance Sheet Discussion The following table presents a comparative analysis of significant balance sheet line items: $ in millions 2008 2007 $ Change % Change Cash and cash equivalents 585.2 915.8 (330.6) (36.1) Unsettled fund receivables 303.7 605.5 (301.8) (49.8) Current investments 123.6 151.4 (27.8) (18.4) Assets held for policyholders 840.2 1,898.0 (1,057.8) (55.7) Non current investments 121.3 114.1 7.2 6.3 Investments of consolidated investment products 843.8 1,239.6 (395.8) (31.9) Goodwill 5,966.8 6,848.0 (881.2) (12.9) Policyholder payables 840.2 1,898.0 (1,057.8) (55.7) Current maturities of long term debt 297.2 &mdash; 297.2 100.0 Long term debt 862.0 1,276.4 (414.4) (32.5) Minority interests in equity of consolidated affiliates 906.7 1,121.2 (214.5) (19.1) Shareholders equity 5,689.5 6,590.6 (901.1) (13.7) Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents decreased from December 31, 2007, to December 31, 2008, primarily because cash provided by our operating activities was exceeded by cash used for financing and investment activities; including the purchase of our shares in the market under our share repurchase program and payments to reduce the drawn balance on our credit facility. Details regarding changes in cash balances are provided within our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Invesco has local capital requirements in several jurisdictions, as well as regional requirements for entities that are part of the European sub group. These requirements mandate the retention of liquid resources in those jurisdictions, which we meet in part by holding cash and cash equivalents. This retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the European sub group or in the countries where it is located. Due to the capital restrictions, the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited. In addition, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that may substantially limit such activity. At December 31, 2008, the European sub group had cash and cash equivalent balances of $427.9 million, much of which is used to satisfy these regulatory requirements. We are in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 39 Unsettled Fund Receivables Unsettled fund receivables decreased from $605.5 million at December 31, 2007, to $303.7 million at December 31, 2008, due to lower transaction activities. Unsettled fund receivables are created by the normal settlement periods on transactions initiated by certain clients of our U.K. and offshore funds. We are legally required to establish a receivable and a substantially offsetting payable at trade date with both the investor and the fund for normal purchases and sales. Investments (Non current and current) As of December 31, 2008, we had $244.9 million in investments, of which $121.3 million were non current investments and $123.6 million were current investments. Included in current investments are $69.1 million of seed money in affiliated funds and $35.5 million of investments related to assets held for deferred compensation plans. Included in non current investments are $95.3 million in equity method investments in our Chinese joint venture and in certain of the companys private equity, real estate and other investment products. Additionally, non current investments include $17.5 million of investments in collateralized loan obligation structures managed by Invesco. Our investments in collateralized loan obligation structures are generally in the form of a relatively small portion of the unrated, junior, subordinated position. As such these positions would share in the first losses to be incurred if the structures were to experience significant increases in default rates of underlying investments above historical levels. Assets Held for Policyholders and Policyholder Payables One of our subsidiaries, Invesco Pensions Limited, is an insurance company that was established to facilitate retirement savings plans in the U.K. The entity holds assets that are managed for its clients on its balance sheet with an equal and offsetting liability. The decreasing balance in these accounts was the result of the transfer of a portion of our U.K. pension administration operations to another provider, foreign exchange movements and the decline in the market values of these assets and liabilities. Investments of consolidated investment products Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation (FIN) No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 requires that the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities (VIEs) consolidate the VIEs. A VIE is an entity that does not have sufficient equity to finance its operations without additional subordinated financial support, or an entity for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests. Generally, limited partnership entities where the general partner does not have substantive equity investment at risk and where the other limited partners do not have substantive (greater than 50%) rights to remove the general partner or to dissolve the limited partnership are also VIEs. The primary beneficiary is the party to the VIE who absorbs a majority of the losses or absorbs the majority of the rewards generated by the VIE. Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights requires that the general partner in a partnership that is not a VIE consolidate the partnership, because the general partner is deemed to control the partnership where the other limited partner do not have substantive kick out, liquidation or participation rights. Investments of consolidated investment products include the investments of both consolidated VIEs, and partnerships that have been consolidated under EITF 04 5. Investment products are also consolidated under FASB Statement No. 94, Consolidation of All Majority Owned Subsidiaries, if appropriate. As of December 31, 2008, investments of consolidated investment products totaled $843.8 million (2007: $1,239.6 million). These investments are offset primarily in minority interests on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, as the companys equity investment in these structures is very small. The decrease from 2007 reflects the impact of declining market values and the deconsolidation of certain previously consolidated VIEs resulting from the companys determination that it was no longer the primary beneficiary of these entities. Goodwill Goodwill decreased from $6,848.0 million at December 31, 2007, to $5,966.8 million at December 31, 2008, primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation for certain subsidiaries whose functional currency differs from that of the parent. The weakening of the U.S. dollar during 2008, mainly against the Canadian dollar and Pound Sterling, resulted in a $926.3 million decrease in goodwill, upon consolidation, with a corresponding decrease to equity. Additional goodwill was recorded in 2008 related to the earn out on the WL Ross acquisition ($43.8 million). The companys annual goodwill impairment review is performed as of October 1 of each year. As a result of that analysis, the company determined that no impairment existed at that date. 40 Due to the declines in global markets experienced during the three months ended December 31, 2008, the company conducted an interim goodwill impairment test at October 31, 2008, and determined that no impairment existed at that date. Interim impairment conclusions, including a reassessment of key assumptions, were reviewed again at December 31, 2008, and the company concluded that no significant changes had occurred. Current Portion of Long term Debt This balance increased from December 31, 2007, as a result of the reclassification out of long term and into current of $297.2 million 4.5% senior notes that mature on December 15, 2009. Long term Debt The decrease in this balance was due to the repayment of borrowings under the credit facility. Minority interests in equity of consolidated entities Minority interests in equity of consolidated entities decreased from $1,121.2 million at December 31, 2007, to $906.7 million at December 31, 2008, primarily due to the impact of declining market values and the deconsolidation of VIEs for which the company determined that it was no longer the primary beneficiary of the arrangements as a result of reconsideration events. The minority interests in equity of consolidated entities are generally offset by the investments of consolidated investment products, as the companys equity investments in these investment products are very small. Total Equity Shareholders equity decreased from $6,590.6 million at December 31, 2007, to $5,689.5 million at December 31, 2008, a decrease of $901.1 million. The decrease included foreign currency translation losses of $1,034.2 million with respect to subsidiaries whose functional currency differs from that of the parent together with $318.0 million of share repurchases, offset by net income of $481.7 million, and share issuances on employee option exercises of $75.7 million. Dividends totaling $207.1 million were recorded during 2008. Liquidity and Capital Resources The existing capital structure of the company, together with the cash flows from operations and borrowings under the credit facility, should provide the company with sufficient resources to meet present and future cash needs. We believe that our cash flows from operations and credit facilities, together with our ability to obtain alternative sources of financing, will enable us to meet operating, debt and other obligations as they come due and anticipated future capital requirements. Future obligations include the maturity of the remaining $297.2 million 4.5% senior notes due December 15, 2009, and the expiration of the $900 million credit facility on March 31, 2010. Our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors including our credit rating, the condition of the global economy, investors willingness to purchase our securities, interest rates, credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets. If we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner, our business could be adversely impacted. Invesco has local capital requirements in several jurisdictions, as well as regional requirements for entities that are part of the European sub group. These requirements require the retention of liquid resources in those jurisdictions, which we meet in part by holding cash and cash equivalents. This retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the European sub group or in the countries where it is located. Due to the capital restrictions, the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited. In addition, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that may substantially limit such activity. At December 31, 2008, the European sub group had cash and cash equivalent balances of $427.9 million, much of which is used to satisfy these regulatory requirements. We are in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Cash Flows The ability to consistently generate cash from operations in excess of capital expenditures and dividend payments is one of our companys fundamental financial strengths. Operations continue to be financed from current earnings and borrowings. Our principal uses of cash, other than for operating expenses, include dividend payments, capital expenditures, acquisitions, purchase of our shares in the open market and investments in certain new investment products. 41 Cash flows of consolidated investment products (discussed in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &mdash; Note 17, Consolidated Investment Products) are reflected in Invescos cash provided by operating activities, used in investing activities and used in financing activities. Cash held by consolidated investment products is not available for general use by Invesco, nor is Invesco cash available for general use by its consolidated investment products. Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 are summarized as follows: $ in millions Cash flow from: 2008 2007 2006 Operating activities 495.7 913.7 455.9 Investing activities (68.6) (46.4) (258.7) Financing activities (666.4) (740.8) (163.1) (Decrease)/increase in cash and cash equivalents (239.3) 126.5 34.1 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of year 915.8 778.9 709.5 Foreign exchange (91.3) 10.4 35.3 Cash and cash equivalents, end of year 585.2 915.8 778.9 Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities is generated by the receipt of investment management and other fees generated from AUM, offset by operating expenses. Cash provided by operating activities in 2008 was $495.7 million, a decrease of $418.0 million or 45.7% over 2007. Changes in operating assets and liabilities contributed $241.6 million of the decrease, and lower net income contributed a further $191.9 million of the decrease in cash flows generated from operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities in 2007 was $913.7 million, an increase of $457.8 million or 100.4% over 2006. Changes in operating assets and liabilities contributed $307.2 million of the increase, and higher net income contributed $190.9 million of the increase in cash flows generated from operating activities. Investing Activities In our institutional operations, we periodically invest in our collateralized loan obligation structures, through a relatively small portion of the unrated, junior subordinated position, and in our private equity funds, as is customary in the industry. Other investors into these structures have no recourse against the company for any losses sustained in the structures. Many of our private equity products are structured as limited partnerships. Our investment may take the form of the general partner or as a limited partner. We received $26.4 million (2007: $10.1 million; 2006: $13.6 million) in return of capital from such investments. We also make seed investments in affiliated funds to assist in the launch of new funds. During 2008, we invested $70.6 million in new funds and recaptured $33.5 million from redemptions of prior investments. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, our capital expenditures were $84.1 million, $36.7 million and $37.9 million, respectively. The increase over 2007 is primarily due to leasehold improvements related to new headquarters space. Other expenditures related principally in each year to technology initiatives, including new platforms from which we maintain our portfolio management systems and fund accounting systems, improvements in computer hardware and software desktop products for employees, new telecommunications products to enhance our internal information flow, and back up disaster recovery systems. Also, in each year, a portion of these costs related to leasehold improvements made to the various buildings and workspaces used in our offices. These projects have been funded with proceeds from our operating cash flows. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, our capital divestitures were not significant relative to our total fixed assets. Net cash outflows of $174.3 million in 2008 and $56.0 million in 2007 related primarily to acquisition earn out payments related to the 2006 acquisitions of PowerShares and WL Ross & Co. 42 Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities reduced from $740.8 million in 2007 to $666.4 million in 2008, primarily due to lower levels of purchases of treasury shares. Cash used for treasury share purchases in 2008 totaled $313.4 million compared to $716.0 million in 2007. Net cash used in financing activities increased from $163.1 million in 2006 to $740.8 million in 2007 as the increase in net inflows from share issuances were offset by the increase in dividends paid and purchase of treasury shares. A summary of shares purchased by month for the fourth quarter of 2008 is presented in Part II, Item 5, Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. Dividends In 2008, Invesco began declaring and paying dividends on a quarterly basis in arrears. The 2008 quarterly dividend was $0.10 per Invesco Ltd. common share. On October 27, 2008, the company declared the third quarter cash dividend, which was paid on December 17, 2008, to shareholders of record as of November 26, 2008. On January 30, 2009, the company declared the fourth quarter cash dividend, which will be paid on March 11, 2009, to shareholders of record as of February 25, 2009. The 2008 total dividend of $0.40 per share represented a 4.2% increase over the 2007 total dividend of $0.384 per share. The declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends will be declared by our board of directors and will depend upon, among other factors, our earnings, financial condition and capital requirements at the time such declaration and payment are considered. The board has a policy of managing dividends in a prudent fashion, with due consideration given to profit levels, overall debt levels, and historical dividend payouts. The following table sets forth the historical amounts for interim, final and total dividends per American Depositary Share in respect of each year indicated: U.S. Cents per American Depositary Share Years Ended December 31, Interim Final Total 2007 16.40 22.00 38.40 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Total 2008 10.0 10.0 10.0 10.0 40.0 Share Repurchase Plan In March 2008, the company completed the $500.0 million share repurchase program that was authorized by the board of directors in June 2007. On April 23, 2008, the board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $1.5 billion with no stated expiration date. During the year ended December 31, 2008, 12.3 million shares of Invesco Ltd. were purchased in the market at a cost of $313.4 million, including 0.7 million of shares purchased directly from current executives for $20.0 million. These shares were recorded as treasury shares on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The company did not make any purchases in the three months ended December 31, 2008, under the $1.5 billion authorization, but did purchase 11,638 shares at a cost of $121,965 from a current officer of the company. Additionally, an aggregate of 0.3 million shares were withheld on vesting events during the year ended December 31, 2008, to meet employees tax obligations. The value of these shares withheld was $4.6 million. 43 Debt Our total indebtedness at December 31, 2008, is $1,159.2 million (December 31, 2007: $1,276.4 million) and is comprised of the following: $ in millions Unsecured Senior Notes: 2008 2007 4.5% &mdash; due December 15, 2009 297.2 300.0 5.625% &mdash; due April 17, 2012 300.0 300.0 5.375% &mdash; due February 27, 2013 350.0 350.0 5.375% &mdash; due December 15, 2014 200.0 200.0 Floating rate credit facility expiring March 31, 2010 12.0 126.4 Total long term debt 1,159.2 1,276.4 Less: current maturities of long term debt 297.2 &mdash; Long term debt 862.0 1,276.4 For the three months and year ended December 31, 2008, the companys weighted average cost of debt was 4.93% and 4.87%, respectively (three months and year ended December 31, 2007: 5.24% and 5.22%, respectively.) Long term debt decreased from $1,276.4 million at December 31, 2007, to $1,159.2 million at December 31, 2008, due primarily to repayment of borrowings under our floating rate credit facility as well as repurchases of long term debt. On November 24, 2008, the company received board authorization to begin repurchasing up to $120 million of the $300 million 4.5% senior notes due December 15, 2009, in open market and privately negotiated transactions. As of December 31, 2008, the company has repurchased $2.8 million at 93.28% of par value. Due to the infrequency with which these bonds trade, it is unlikely that the firm will be able to retire significant amounts of this debt in the open market. In the past, debt issuance proceeds have been used by the company to form part of the consideration paid for acquisitions and also for the integration of the acquired businesses over time. On January 16, 2007, $300.0 million of our 5.9% senior notes matured and was paid using a draw on our credit facility. On April 17, 2007, the company issued $300.0 million five year 5.625% senior notes. The net proceeds from the offering were used to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facility and for general corporate purposes. Interest is paid semi annually on the senior notes. The senior notes are unsecured. On March 31, 2005, we entered into a five year unsecured $900.0 million credit facility with a group of lenders that was amended and restated in December 2007 in conjunction with the redomicile and relisting of the company. The company draws and repays its credit facility balances and utilizes the credit facility for working capital and other cash needs. The financial covenants under our credit agreement include a leverage ratio of not greater than 3.25:1.00 (debt/EBITDA, as defined in the credit facility) and an interest coverage ratio of not less than 4.00:1.00 (EBITDA as defined in the credit facility/interest payable for the four consecutive fiscal quarters). The breach of any covenant would result in a default under the credit facility, which could lead to lenders requiring all balances under the credit facility, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. This credit facility also contains customary affirmative operating covenants and negative covenants that, among other things, restrict certain of our subsidiaries ability to incur debt, transfer assets, merge, make loans and other investments and create liens. As of December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with our debt covenants. The coverage ratios, as defined in our credit facility, were as follows during 2008, 2007 and 2006: 2008 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Leverage Ratio 1.25 1.11 1.17 1.28 Interest Coverage Ratio 16.99 16.53 15.19 12.20 2007 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Leverage Ratio 1.18 0.97 0.91 1.04 Interest Coverage Ratio 12.96 13.54 14.30 17.81 2006 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Leverage Ratio 1.62 1.60 1.46 1.24 Interest Coverage Ratio 9.22 10.69 11.67 12.93 44 We have received credit ratings of A3 and BBB+ from Moodys and Standard & Poors credit rating agencies, respectively, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Both Standard & Poors and Moodys have a stable outlook for the rating as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. According to Moodys, obligations rated A are considered upper medium grade and are subject to low credit risk. Invescos rating of A3 is at the low end of the A range (A1, A2, A3), but three notches above the lowest investment grade rating of Baa3. Standard and Poors rating of BBB+ is at the upper end of the BBB rating, with BBB representing Standard and Poors lowest investment grade rating. According to Standard and Poors, BBB obligations exhibit adequate protection parameters; however adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitments. We believe that rating agency concerns include but are not limited to: our ability to sustain net positive asset flows across customer channels, product type and geographies, our substantial indebtedness, and our ability to maintain consistent positive investment performance. Additionally, the rating agencies could decide to downgrade the entire asset management industry, based on their perspective of future growth and solvency. Material deterioration of these factors, and others defined by each rating agency, could result in downgrades to our credit ratings, thereby limiting our ability to generate additional financing. Because our credit facility borrowing rates are not tied to credit ratings, and interest rates on our outstanding senior notes are fixed, there is no direct correlation between changes in ratings and interest expense of the company. However, management believes that solid investment grade ratings are an important factor in winning and maintaining institutional business and strives to manage the company to maintain such ratings. Disclosure of these ratings is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our debt. These credit ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at anytime by Moodys or Standard & Poors. Each rating should be evaluated independently. Credit and Liquidity Risk Capital management involves the management of the companys liquidity and cash flows. The company manages its capital by reviewing annual and projected cash flow forecasts and by monitoring credit, liquidity and market risks, such as interest rate and foreign currency risks (as discussed in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk), through measurement and analysis. The company is primarily exposed to credit risk through its cash and cash equivalent deposits, which are held by external firms. The company invests its cash balances in its own institutional money market products, as well as with external high credit quality financial institutions; however, we have chosen to limit the number of firms with which we invest. These arrangements create exposure to concentrations of credit risk. Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation. The company is subject to credit risk in the following areas of its business: &bull; All cash and cash equivalent balances are subject to credit risk, as they represent deposits made by the company with external banks and other institutions. As of December 31, 2008, our maximum exposure to credit risk related to our cash and cash equivalent balances is $585.2 million. Cash and cash equivalents invested in affiliated money market funds (related parties) totaled $172.3 million at December 31, 2008. &bull; Certain trust subsidiaries of the company accept deposits and place deposits with other institutions on behalf of our customers. As of December 31, 2008, our maximum exposure to credit risk related to these transactions is $0.9 million. The company does not utilize credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate the maximum exposure to credit risk. The company does not expect any counterparties to its financial instruments to fail to meet their obligations. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities. The company is exposed to liquidity risk through its $1,159.2 million in total long term debt. The company actively manages liquidity risk by preparing cash flow forecasts for future periods, reviewing them regularly with senior management, maintaining a committed credit facility, scheduling significant gaps between major debt maturities and engaging external financing sources in regular dialog. Effects of Inflation Inflation can impact our organization primarily in two ways. First, inflationary pressures can result in increases in our cost structure, especially to the extent that large expense components such as compensation are impacted. To the degree that these expense 45 increases are not recoverable or cannot be counterbalanced through pricing increases due to the competitive environment, our profitability could be negatively impacted. Secondly, the value of the assets that we manage may be negatively impacted when inflationary expectations result in a rising interest rate environment. Declines in the values of these AUM could lead to reduced revenues as management fees are generally calculated based upon the size of AUM. Off Balance Sheet Commitments The company transacts with various private equity, real estate and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business. Certain of these investments are considered to be variable interest entities of which the company is the primary beneficiary and certain of these investments are limited partnerships for which the company is the general partner and is deemed to have control (with the absence of substantive kick out, liquidation or participation rights of the other limited partners) and are consolidated into the companys financial statements under EITF 04 5 (see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &mdash; Note 17, Consolidated Investment Products and Note 1, Accounting Policies for additional information on consolidated and unconsolidated investment products). Many of the companys investment products are structured as limited partnerships. Our investment may take the form of the general partner or as a limited partner, and the entities are structured such that each partner makes capital commitments that are to be drawn down over the life of the partnership as investment opportunities are identified. At December 31, 2008, our undrawn capital commitments were $36.5 million (2007: $60.2 million). The volatility and valuation dislocations that occurred during 2007 and 2008 in certain sectors of the fixed income market have generated some pricing issues in many areas of the market. As a result of these valuation dislocations, during the fourth quarter of 2007, Invesco elected to enter into contingent support agreements for two of its investment trusts to enable them to sustain a stable pricing structure. These two trusts are unregistered trusts that invest in fixed income securities and are available only to accredited investors. In December 2008, the agreements were amended to extend the term through June 30, 2009. As of December 31, 2008, the committed support under these agreements was $43.0 million with an internal approval mechanism to increase the maximum possible support to $64.5 million at the option of the company. The fair value of these agreements at December 31, 2008, was estimated to be $5.5 million, which was recorded as a guarantee obligation. No payments have been made under either agreement nor has Invesco realized any losses from the support agreements. These trusts were not consolidated because the company was not deemed to be the primary beneficiary under FIN 46R. Contractual Obligations We have various financial obligations that require future cash payments. The following table outlines the timing of payment requirements related to our commitments as of December 31, 2008: $ in millions Total(4)(5) Within 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More Than 5 Years Total debt 1,159.2 297.2 312.0 550.0 &mdash; Estimated interest payments on total debt(1) 221.7 59.9 92.9 68.9 &mdash; Finance leases 0.3 0.2 0.1 &mdash; &mdash; Operating leases(2) 478.9 56.6 96.6 86.2 239.5 Defined benefit pension and postretirement medical obligations(3) 318.0 7.4 16.8 19.4 274.4 Total 2,178.1 421.3 518.4 724.5 513.9 (1) Total debt includes $1,159.2 million of fixed rate debt. Fixed interest payments are therefore reflected in the table above in the periods they are due. The credit facility, $900.0 million at December 31, 2008, provides for borrowings of various maturities. Interest is payable based upon LIBOR, Prime, Federal Funds or other bank provided rates in existence at the time of each borrowing. Estimated credit facility interest payments in the table above are based upon an assumption that the credit facility balance of $12.0 million and the interest rate that existed at December 31, 2008, will remain until credit facility maturity on March 31, 2010. 46 (2) Operating leases reflect obligations for leased building space and sponsorship and naming rights agreements. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &mdash; Note 19, Operating Leases for sublease information. (3) The defined benefit obligation of $318.0 million is comprised of $271.2 million related to pension plans and $46.8 million related to a postretirement medical plan. The fair value of plan assets at December 31, 2008, was $224.6 million for the retirement plan and $6.3 million for the medical plan. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &mdash; Note 20, Retirement Benefit Plans for detailed benefit pension and postretirement plan information. (4) Other contingent payments at December 31, 2008, include $500.0 million related to the PowerShares acquisition and $165.0 million related to the WL Ross & Co. acquisition, which are excluded until such time as they are probable and reasonably estimable. (5) Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2008, the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $55.9 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 15 &mdash; Taxation for a discussion on income taxes. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &mdash; Note 1, Accounting Policies to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition are those that require complex management judgment regarding matters that are highly uncertain at the time policies were applied and estimates were made. These accounting policies and estimates are discussed below. Different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period that would have had a material effect on these financial statements, and changes in these estimates are likely to occur from period to period in the future. Share Based Compensation. We have issued equity settled share based awards to certain employees, which are measured at fair value at the date of grant. These awards consist of restricted share awards (RSAs), restricted share units (RSUs) and share option awards. Time vested awards vest ratably over or cliff vest at the end of a period of continued employee service. Performance vested awards cliff vest at the end of a defined vesting period of continued employee service upon the companys attainment of certain performance criteria, generally the attainment of cumulative EPS growth targets at the end of the vesting period reflecting a compound annual growth rate of between 10.0% and 15.0% per annum during a three year period. Time vested and performance vested share awards are granted in the form of RSAs or RSUs. Dividends accrue directly to the employee holder of RSAs, and cash payments in lieu of dividends are made to employee holders of certain RSUs. There is therefore no discount to the fair value of these share awards at their grant date. The fair value of these awards is determined at the grant date and is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the companys estimate of shares that will eventually vest. The forfeiture rate applied to most grants is 5% per annum, based upon our historical experience with respect to employee turnover. Fair value for RSAs and RSUs representing equity interests identical to those associated with shares traded in the open market are determined using the market price at the time of grant. Fair value is measured by use of the Black Scholes valuation model for certain RSUs that do not include dividend rights and a stochastic model (a lattice based model) for share option awards. The expected life of share based payment awards used in these models is adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioral considerations. Changes in the assumptions used in the stochastic valuation model for share option awards, as well as changes in the companys estimates of vesting (including the companys evaluation of performance conditions associated with certain share based payment awards and assumptions used in determining award lapse rates) could have a material impact on the share based payment charge recorded in each year. During the three months ended December 31, 2008, the company reversed cumulative costs previously recognized related to performance based share awards granted in 2007 based upon the expectation that the required performance targets for the vesting of these awards will not be attained and the awards will not vest. There have been no grants of share options since 2005. 47 RSUs that do not include dividend rights or cash payments in lieu of dividends are valued using the Black Scholes model. There were no such awards granted in 2008 or 2007. The assumptions used in the Black Scholes model for these awards granted in 2006 are as follows: 2006 Weighted average share price* 1,034p Expected term 5.3 years Expected dividend yield 1.84% * Share prices are in Pounds Sterling, the currency of the awards. The table below is a summary, as of December 31, 2008, of equity settled share based compensation awards outstanding under the companys share based compensation programs.

See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &mdash; Note 16, Earnings Per Share. Other Compensation Arrangements. We offer certain performance based cash awards to many of our employees that are based upon purely discretionary determinations or, alternatively, certain formulaic compensation arrangements. The formulaic arrangements require that we monitor on an ongoing basis whether or not pre established metrics are expected to be met in order to properly record the related expense amounts. Because many of the metrics relate to matters that are highly uncertain or susceptible to change, our estimates may not accurately reflect the ultimate outcomes that will be achieved, and associated expense that should be recognized, with respect to these compensation arrangements. Taxation. After compensation and related costs, our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense. We operate in several countries and several states through our various subsidiaries, and must allocate our income, expenses, and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions. Accordingly, our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred for doing business each year in all of our locations. Annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions within each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities. Each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations. Because the determinations of our annual provisions are subject to judgments and estimates, it is possible that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements. As a result, it is likely that additions to, or reductions of, income tax expense will occur each year for prior reporting periods as actual tax returns and tax audits are settled. Income taxes are provided for in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements, using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that 49 includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. As a multinational corporation, the company operates in various locations outside of Bermuda and generates substantially all of its earnings from our subsidiaries. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of the companys subsidiaries, consolidated investment products, and joint ventures, except where it is our intention to continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings. Our Canadian and U.S. subsidiaries continue to be directly owned by Invesco Holding Company Limited (formerly INVESCO PLC, our predecessor company), which is directly owned by Invesco Ltd. Our Canadian unremitted earnings, for which we are indefinitely reinvested, are estimated to be $953 million at December 31, 2008, compared with $880 million at December 31, 2007. If distributed as a dividend, Canadian withholding tax of 5.0% would be due. Deferred tax liabilities in the amount of $8.9 million (2007: $14.1 million) for additional U.K. tax have been recognized for unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries that have regularly remitted earnings and are expected to continue to remit earnings in the foreseeable future. Dividends from our investment in the U.S. should not give rise to additional tax as we are not subject to withholding tax between the U.S. and U.K., the underlying U.S. tax rate is greater than the U.K. tax rate, and we have U.K. tax credits available. There are no additional taxes on dividends from the U.K. to Bermuda. Net deferred tax assets have been recognized in the U.S., U.K., and Canada based on managements belief that operating income and capital gains will, more likely than not, be sufficient to realize the benefits of these assets over time. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates, or if our historical trends of positive operating income in any of these locations changes, we may be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, which may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Invesco adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes &mdash; an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, (FIN 48) on January 1, 2007. This interpretation prescribes a specific recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The two step process prescribed by FIN 48 for evaluating a tax position involves first determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities. If it is, the second step then requires a company to measure this tax position benefit as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Invesco classifies any interest and penalties on tax liabilities (or any overpayments) on the Consolidated Statements of Income as components of income tax expense. Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed and is recorded in the functional currency of the acquired entity. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the single reporting unit level on an annual basis, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. If the carrying amount of goodwill at the reporting unit exceeds its implied fair value (the first step of the goodwill impairment test), then the second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The principal method of determining fair value of the reporting unit is an income approach where future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount. The discount rate used is derived based on the time value of money and the risk profile of the stream of future cash flows. Recent results and projections based on expectations regarding revenues, expenses, capital expenditures and acquisition earn out payments produce a present value for the reporting unit. While the company believes all assumptions utilized in our assessment are reasonable and appropriate, changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different goodwill impairment assessments. The most sensitive of these assumptions are the estimated cash flows and the use of a weighted average cost of capital as the discount rate to determine present value. We have determined that we have one reporting unit as defined under FASB Statement No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. The company also utilizes a market approach to provide a secondary and corroborative fair value of the reporting unit by using comparable company and transaction multiples to estimate values for our single reporting unit. Discretion and judgment is required in determining whether the transaction data available represents information for companies of comparable nature, scope and size. The results of the secondary market approach to provide a fair value estimate are not combined or weighted with the results of the income approach described above but are used to provide an additional basis to determine the reasonableness of the income approach fair value estimate. 50 The company cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled $5,966.8 million and $6,848.0 million at December 31, 2008, and December 31, 2007, respectively. Such events include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on the companys assets under management, or any other material negative change in assets under management and related management fees. Our goodwill impairment testing conducted during 2008 and 2007 indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, indicating that step two of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary. The companys annual goodwill impairment review is performed as of October 1 of each year. As a result of that analysis, the company determined that no impairment existed at that date. Due to the declines in global markets experienced during the three months ended December 31, 2008, the company conducted an interim goodwill impairment test at October 31, 2008, and determined that no impairment existed at that date. Interim impairment conclusions, including a reassessment of key assumptions, were reviewed again at December 31, 2008, and the company concluded that no significant changes had occurred. A 5% decline in the fair value of our reporting unit, or a 1% increase in the discount rate assumption used during our October 31, 2008, interim goodwill impairment analysis, would have caused the carrying value of our reporting unit to be in excess of its fair value, which would require the second step to be performed. The second step could have resulted in an impairment loss for goodwill. Investments. Most of our investments are carried at fair value on our balance sheet with the periodic mark to market recorded either in accumulated other comprehensive income in the case of available for sale investments or directly to earnings in the case of trading assets. Fair value is generally determined by reference to an active trading market, using quoted close or bid prices as of each reporting period end. When a readily ascertainable market value does not exist for an investment (such as our collateralized loan obligations, discussed below) the fair value is calculated based on the expected cash flows of its underlying net asset base, taking into account applicable discount rates and other factors. Since assumptions are made in determining the fair values of investments for which active markets do not exist, the actual value that may be realized upon the sale or other disposition of these investments could differ from the current carrying values. Fair value calculations are also required in association with our quarterly impairment testing of investments. The accuracy of our other than temporary impairment assessments are dependent upon the extent to which we are able to accurately determine fair values. The company provides investment management services to a number of collateralized loan obligation entities (CLOs). These entities are investment vehicles created for the sole purpose of issuing CLO instruments that offer investors the opportunity for returns that vary with the risk level of their investment. The notes issued by the CLOs are backed by diversified portfolios consisting primarily of loans or structured debt. For managing the collateral for the CLO entities, the company earns investment management fees, including in some cases subordinated management fees, as well as contingent incentive fees. The company has invested in certain of the entities, generally taking a relatively small portion of the unrated, junior subordinated position. At December 31, 2008, the company held $17.5 million of investment in these CLOs, which represents its maximum risk of loss. Our investments in CLOs are generally subordinated to other interests in the entity and entitle the investor to receive the residual cash flows, if any, from the entity. As a result, the companys investment is sensitive to changes in the credit quality of the issuers of the collateral securities, including changes in the forecasted default rates and any declines in anticipated recovery rates. Investors in CLOs have no recourse against the company for any losses sustained in the CLO structure. Management has concluded that the company is not the primary beneficiary of any of the CLO entities and it has recorded its investments at fair value primarily using an income approach. Fair value is determined using current information, notably market yields and projected cash flows based on forecasted default and recovery rates that a market participant would use in determining the current fair value of the equity interest. Market yields, default rates and recovery rates used in the companys estimate of fair value vary based on the nature of the investments in the underlying collateral pools. In periods of rising market yields, default rates and lower debt recovery rates, the fair value, and therefore carrying value, of the companys investments in these CLO entities may be adversely affected. The current liquidity constraints within the market for CLO products require the use of unobservable inputs for CLO valuation. The excess of actual and anticipated future cash flows over the initial investment at the date of purchase is recognized as interest income over the life of the investment using the effective yield method in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 20, Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets. The company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CLO entity. Cash flow estimates are based on the underlying pool of securities and take into account the overall credit quality of the issuers, the forecasted default rate of the securities and the companys past experience in managing similar securities. If the updated estimate of future cash flows (taking into account both timing and amounts) is less than the last revised estimate, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its fair value and is recorded through the income statement. An increase or decrease in the discount rate of 1.0% would change the valuation of the CLOs by $0.5 million (2007: $0.9 million; 2006: $1.2 million) as of December 31, 2008. 51 Consolidated Investment Products. Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation (FIN) No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 requires that the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities (VIEs) consolidate the VIEs. A VIE is an entity that does not have sufficient equity to finance its operations without additional subordinated financial support, or an entity for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests. Generally, limited partnership entities where the general partner does not have substantive equity investment at risk and where the other limited partners do not have substantive (greater than 50%) rights to remove the general partner or to dissolve the limited partnership are also VIEs. The primary beneficiary is the party to the VIE who absorbs a majority of the losses or retains the majority of the rewards generated by the VIE. Additionally, certain investment products are structured as limited partnerships of which the company is the general partner and is deemed to have control with the lack of substantive kick out, liquidation or participation rights of the other limited partners. These investment products are also consolidated into the companys financial statements under Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights. The company also consolidates certain investment products under FASB Statement No. 94, Consolidation of All Majority Owned Subsidiaries (FASB Statement No. 94). Assessing if an entity is a VIE or an entity falling under the consolidation requirements of EITF 04 5 involves judgment and analysis on a structure by structure basis. Factors included in this assessment include the legal organization of the entity, the companys contractual involvement with the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the companys involvement with the entity. Determining if the company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE also requires significant judgment, as the calculation of expected losses and residual returns involves estimation and probability assumptions. If current financial statements are not available for consolidated VIEs or an investment product consolidated under EITF 04 5, estimation of investment valuation is required, which includes assessing available quantitative and qualitative data. Significant changes in these estimates could impact the reported value of the investments held by consolidated investment products and the related minority interest. As of December 31, 2008, the company consolidated VIEs that held investments of $141.9 million (2007: $825.8 million) and partnership investments under EITF 04 5 and FASB Statement No. 94 of $701.9 million (2007: $413.8million). Effective April 1, 2008, the company determined that certain previously consolidated VIEs should be deconsolidated since the company no longer was the primary beneficiary of these entities. As circumstances supporting estimates and factors change, the determination of VIE and primary beneficiary status may change, as could the determination of the necessity of consolidation under EITF 04 5. Contingencies. Contingencies arise when we have a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event that is both probable and reasonably estimable. We must from time to time make material estimates with respect to legal and other contingencies. The nature of our business requires compliance with various state and federal statutes and exposes us to a variety of legal proceedings and matters in the ordinary course of business. While the outcomes of matters such as these are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict, we maintain reserves reflected in other current and other non current liabilities, as appropriate, for identified losses that are, in our judgment, probable and reasonably estimable. Managements judgment is based on the advice of legal counsel, ruling on various motions by the applicable court, review of the outcome of similar matters, if applicable, and review of guidance from state or federal agencies, if applicable. Contingent consideration payable in relation to a business acquisition is recorded when the outcome of the contingency is resolved and the consideration is issued or becomes issuable. Recent Accounting Developments See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &mdash; Note 1, Accounting Policies &mdash; Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted and Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of its business, the company is primarily exposed to market risk in the form of securities market risk, interest rate risk, and foreign exchange rate risk. AUM Market Price Risk The companys investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM. Declines in equity or fixed income security market prices could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by: &bull; Causing the value of AUM to decrease. 52 &bull; Causing the returns realized on AUM to decrease (impacting performance fees). &bull; Causing clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that the company does not serve. &bull; Causing clients to rebalance assets away from investments that the company manages into investments that the company does not manage. &bull; Causing clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher revenues into products that earn lower revenues. Underperformance of client accounts relative to competing products could exacerbate these factors. Securities Market Risk The company has investments in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments are generally made to establish a track record or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. The companys exposure to market risk arises from its investments. The following table summarizes the fair values of the investments exposed to market risk and provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of those investments, assuming a 20% increase or decrease in fair values: $ in millions Carrying Value Fair Value assuming 20% increase Fair Value assuming 20% decrease December 31, 2008 Trading investments: Investments related to deferred compensation plans 35.5 42.6 28.4 Other 0.7 0.8 0.6 Total trading investments 36.2 43.4 29.0 Available for sale investments: Seed money in affiliated funds 69.1 82.9 55.3 Other 8.5 10.2 6.8 Equity method investments 95.3 114.4 76.2 Total market risk on investments 209.1 250.9 167.3 $ in millions Carrying Value Fair Value assuming 20% increase Fair Value assuming 20% decrease December 31, 2007 Trading investments: Investments related to deferred compensation plans 58.8 70.6 47.0 Other 2.0 2.4 1.6 Total trading investments 60.8 73.0 48.6 Available for sale investments: Seed money in affiliated funds 60.9 73.1 48.7 Other 8.6 10.3 6.9 Equity method investments 66.5 79.8 53.2 Total market risk on investments 196.8 236.2 157.4 53 Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk relates to the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its external debt and cash and cash equivalent investments. On December 31, 2008, the interest rates on 99% of the companys borrowings were fixed for an average period of 3.4 years. The remainder of the companys borrowings were floating. The interest rate profile of the financial assets of the company on December 31, 2008, was: $ in millions Carrying Value Fair Value assuming a +1% interest rate change Fair Value assuming a 1% interest rate change December 31, 2008 Available for sale investments: Collateralized loan obligations 17.5 17.0 18.0 Foreign time deposits 17.3 17.2 17.3 Other 1.0 1.0 1.0 Total investments 35.8 35.2 36.3 December 31, 2007 Available for sale investments: Collateralized loan obligations 39.0 38.1 39.4 Foreign time deposits 22.7 22.6 22.8 Other 1.0 1.0 1.0 Total available for sale investments 62.7 61.7 63.2 U.S. Treasury and governmental agency securities 6.0 6.0 6.0 Total investments 68.7 67.7 69.2 The interest rate profile of the financial liabilities of the company on December 31 was: $ in millions Total Floating Rate Fixed Rate* Weighted Average Interest Rate (%) Weighted Average Period for Which Rate is Fixed (Years) 2008 Currency: U.S. dollar 1,159.2 12.0 1,147.2 4.9 3.4 Japanese yen 0.3 &mdash; 0.3 9.1 2.1 1,159.5 12.0 1,147.5 4.9 3.4 2007 Currency: U.S. dollar 1,276.4 126.4 1,150.0 5.2 4.4 Japanese yen 0.4 &mdash; 0.4 9.3 3.0 1,276.8 126.4 1,150.4 5.2 4.4 * Measured at amortized cost. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &mdash; Note 10, Long Term Debt for additional disclosures relating to the U.S. dollar floating and fixed rate obligations. A 1.0% increase in interest rates would have increased the recorded interest expense on the floating rate debt by $0.1 million. 54 The companys only fixed interest financial assets at December 31, 2008, are in foreign time deposit investments of $17.3 million (2007: $22.7 million) and in U.S. Treasury and U.S. governmental agency securities of $0.0 million (2007: $6.0 million). The weighted average interest rate on these investments is 2.08% (2007: 2.63%) and the average weighted time for which the rate is fixed is 0.4 years (2007: 0.4 years). Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The company has transactional currency exposures that occur when any of the companys subsidiaries receives or pays cash in a currency different from its functional currency. Such exposure arises from sales or purchases by an operating unit in currencies other than the units functional currency. These exposures are not actively managed. The company also has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets and results of operations are exposed to foreign currency translation risk when translated into U.S. dollars upon consolidation into Invesco Ltd. The company does not hedge these exposures. Prior to the redenomination of the share capital of the Parent and the change in its functional currency from the Pound Sterling to U.S. dollars, the company designated its U.S. dollar senior note balances as hedges against its net investments in its U.S. subsidiaries. Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &mdash; Note 10, Long Term Debt details the fair values of the U.S. dollar senior notes (the hedging instruments) at December 31, 2007, and 2006. Gains or losses on the retranslation of these borrowings were transferred to equity to offset any gains and losses on the net investments in subsidiaries. The company is exposed to foreign exchange revaluation into the income statement on monetary assets and liabilities that are held by subsidiaries in different functional currencies than the subsidiaries functional currencies. Net foreign exchange revaluation losses were $10.7 million in 2008 (2007: loss of $10.4 million), and are included in general and administrative expenses and other gains and losses, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income. We continue to monitor our exposure to foreign exchange revaluation. 55 Supplementary Quarterly Financial Data The following is selected unaudited consolidated data for Invesco Ltd. for the quarters ended: $ in millions, except per share data Q408 Q308 Q208 Q108 Q407 Q307 Q207 Q107 Operating revenues: Investment management fees $478.5 $664.9 $736.8 $737.6 $816.4 $791.7 $765.7 $706.3 Performance fees 23.8 18.1 22.2 11.0 13.1 4.0 34.4 18.8 Service and distribution fees 101.4 129.4 143.3 138.4 150.8 150.7 148.2 143.4 Other 30.7 14.8 33.3 23.4 42.8 30.2 30.7 31.7 Total operating revenues 634.4 827.2 935.6 910.4 1,023.1 976.6 979.0 900.2 Operating expenses: Employee compensation 236.0 264.1 282.9 272.8 286.3 278.1 288.9 284.3 Third party distribution, service and advisory 162.6 220.9 244.9 247.1 284.9 270.8 263.0 232.4 Marketing 31.3 34.8 38.2 43.9 43.9 40.9 35.8 37.0 Property, office and technology 58.0 50.5 55.7 50.1 60.3 66.6 58.2 57.4 General and administrative 62.0 61.7 73.9 68.4 104.0 63.7 71.1 57.0 Total operating expenses 549.9 632.0 695.6 682.3 779.4 720.1 717.0 668.1 Operating Income 84.5 195.2 240.0 228.1 243.7 256.5 262.0 232.1 Other income/(expense): Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 11.3 8.0 9.6 17.9 21.0 14.9 6.4 5.8 Interest income 7.2 8.0 10.5 11.5 11.8 14.1 12.3 10.3 Gains and losses of consolidated investment products, net (56.8) 2.8 40.3 (44.3) 55.8 58.7 69.8 30.0 Interest expense (17.8) (18.3) (19.3) (21.5) (17.7) (16.4) (18.6) (18.6) Other gains and losses, net (21.9) (10.4) (1.1) (6.5) 6.3 (3.7) (0.2) 7.5 Income before income taxes and minority interest 6.5 185.3 280.0 185.2 320.9 324.1 331.7 267.1 Income tax provision (35.8) (49.2) (77.2) (73.8) (91.3) (92.7) (91.4) (81.9) Income before minority interest (29.3) 136.1 202.8 111.4 229.6 231.4 240.3 185.2 Minority interest (income)/losses of consolidated entities, net of tax 61.2 (4.3) (40.0) 43.8 (53.7) (64.4) (64.8) (30.0) Net Income $31.9 $131.8 $162.8 $155.2 $175.9 $167.0 $175.5 $155.2 Earnings per share*: &mdash; basic $0.08 $0.34 $0.42 $0.40 $0.45 $0.42 $0.44 $0.39 &mdash; diluted $0.08 $0.33 $0.41 $0.39 $0.43 $0.41 $0.43 $0.38 Average shares outstanding*: &mdash; basic 384.1 386.0 387.6 387.8 393.6 400.0 399.9 398.9 &mdash; diluted 393.3 397.9 399.0 399.4 407.6 410.5 410.6 410.1 Dividends declared per share*: $0.10 $0.10 $0.10 $0.22 &mdash; $0.164 &mdash; $0.208 * All per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the impact of the December 4, 2007, one for two reverse stock split.
