Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview This Annual Report on Form 10 K contains certain statements that are, or may be deemed to be, forward looking statements within the meaning of section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and are made in reliance upon the protections provided by such acts for forward looking statements. These forward looking statements (such as when we describe what we believe, expect or anticipate will occur, and other similar statements) include, but are not limited to, statements regarding future sales and operating results, future prospects, anticipated benefits of proposed (or future) acquisitions and new facilities, growth, the capabilities and capacities of business operations, any financial or other guidance and all statements that are not based on historical fact, but rather reflect our current expectations concerning future results and events. The ultimate correctness of these forward looking statements is dependent upon a number of known and unknown risks and events, and is subject to various uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these statements. The following important factors, among others, could affect future results and events, causing those results and events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward looking statements: business conditions and growth in our customers industries, the electronic manufacturing services industry and the general economy, variability of operating results, our dependence on a limited number of major customers, the potential consolidation of our customer base, availability of components, dependence on certain industries, variability of customer requirements, our ability to successfully negotiate definitive agreements and consummate acquisitions, and to integrate operations following consummation of acquisitions, other economic, business and competitive factors affecting our customers, our industry and business generally and other factors that we may not have currently identified or quantified. For a further list and description of various risks, relevant factors and uncertainties that could cause future results or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward looking statements, see the Factors Affecting Future Results section elsewhere in this document. All forward looking statements included in this Report on Form 10 K are made only as of the date of this Report on Form 10 K, and we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or correct any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that subsequently occur or which we hereafter become aware of. You should read this document and the documents that we incorporate by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10 K completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We may not update these forward looking statements, even if our situation changes in the future. All forward looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified by these cautionary statements. We are one of the leading worldwide independent providers of turnkey manufacturing services to electronics OEMs in the networking, telecommunications, computing and storage, instrumentation and medical, computer, peripherals, automotive and consumer products industries. While operating income and net income decreased in fiscal years 2001 and 2002, we have historically experienced substantial growth in net revenue, operating income and net income. This growth, as well as the historical growth of the overall EMS industry, which subsided in early to mid 2001, has been driven by the increasing number of electronics OEMs who are outsourcing their manufacturing requirements. We anticipate that this industry outsourcing trend will continue during the next several years. We derive most of our net revenue under purchase orders from OEM customers. We recognize revenue, net of product returns, when goods are shipped, title and risk of ownership have passed, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and recoverability is reasonably assured. The volume and timing of orders placed by our customers vary due to several factors, including: variation in demand for our customers products; our customers inventory management; new product introductions and manufacturing strategy changes; and consolidations among our customers. Demand for our customers products depends on, among other things, product life cycles, competitive conditions and general economic conditions. 15 Table of Contents Our cost of revenue includes the cost of electronic components and other materials that comprise the products we manufacture, the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead, and adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory. As a provider of turnkey manufacturing services, we are responsible for procuring components and other materials. This requires us to commit significant working capital to our operations and to manage the purchasing, receiving, inspection and stocking of materials. Although we bear the risk of fluctuations in the cost of materials and excess scrap, we periodically negotiate cost of materials adjustments with our customers. Net revenue from each product that we manufacture consists of a component based on the costs of materials in that product and a component based on the labor and manufacturing overhead allocation to that product. We refer to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on labor and manufacturing overhead costs as manufacturing based revenue, and to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on materials costs as material based revenue. Our gross margin for any product depends on the mix between the cost of materials in the product and the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead allocated to the product. We typically realize higher gross margins on manufacturing based revenue than we do on materials based revenue. As we gain experience in manufacturing a product, we usually achieve increased efficiencies, which result in lower labor costs and manufacturing overhead for that product. Our operating results are impacted by the level of capacity utilization of manufacturing facilities, indirect labor and selling, general and administrative expenses. Gross margins and operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high production volume and high capacity utilization. During periods of low production volume, we generally have idle capacity and reduced operating margins. As our capacity has grown during recent years, through the construction of new greenfield facilities, the expansion of existing facilities and our acquisition of additional facilities, our selling, general and administrative expenses have increased to support this growth. We have consistently utilized advanced circuit design, production design and manufacturing technologies to meet the needs of our customers. To support this effort, our engineering staff focuses on developing and refining design and manufacturing technologies to meet specific needs of specific customers. Most of the expenses associated with these customer specific efforts are reflected in our cost of revenue. In addition, our engineers engage in research and development of new technologies that apply generally to our operations. The expenses of these research and development activities are reflected in the Research and Development line item in our Consolidated Financial Statements. An important element of our strategy is the expansion of our global production facilities. The majority of our revenue and materials costs worldwide are denominated in U.S. dollars, while our labor and utility costs in plants outside the United States are denominated in local currencies. We hedge these local currency costs, based on our evaluation of the potential exposure as compared to the cost of the hedge, through the purchase of foreign exchange contracts, the amount and cost of which have not been material. Changes in the fair market value of such hedging instruments are included in other comprehensive income. See Note 1(p) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Comprehensive Income to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue. Significant reductions in sales to any of our large customers would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In the past, some of our customers have terminated their manufacturing arrangements with us, and other customers have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of manufacturing services ordered from us. There can be no assurance that present or future customers will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us or significantly change, reduce or delay the amount of manufacturing services ordered from us. Any such termination of a manufacturing relationship or change, reduction or delay in orders could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. See Note 9 Concentration of Risk and Segment Data to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 16 Table of Contents Acquisitions and Expansion During fiscal 2000, we made an acquisition that was accounted for as a pooling of interests and our consolidated financials statements have been restated to reflect the combined operations of the merged companies for all periods presented. In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations (SFAS 141), which requires all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method. We have also made a number of other acquisitions that were accounted for using the purchase method. Our consolidated financial statements include the operating results of each business from the date of acquisition. For further discussion of our acquisitions, see Note 12 Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During the first quarter of fiscal 2003, we purchased certain operations of Lucent Technologies of Shanghai (LTOS) in Shanghai, China. We acquired these operations in an effort to enhance our competencies in complex optical assembly and design services, to broaden our base of manufacturing for the communications industry in Asia and to strengthen our relationship with Lucent Technologies (Lucent). Simultaneous with the purchase, we entered into a three year supply agreement with Lucent to manufacture optical switching and other communications infrastructure products. The transaction will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Total consideration paid was approximately $75.0 million in cash. Funding for this acquisition was provided by current working capital. During the first quarter of fiscal 2003, we purchased certain operations of Seagate Technology Reynosa, S. de R.L. de C.V. (Seagate) in Reynosa, Mexico. We acquired these operations to expand our repair presence in the data storage market and to add a low cost service site in Latin America. Simultaneous with the purchase, our wholly owned subsidiary entered into a two year agreement to provide repair and warranty services for Seagates Personal Storage and Enterprise Storage hard disk drives. The transaction will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Total consideration paid was approximately $26.0 million in cash. Funding for this acquisition was provided by current working capital. During the first quarter of fiscal 2003, we purchased certain operations of Philips Electronics (Philips) in Austria, Brazil, China, Hungary, Poland and Singapore. We expect to complete the purchase of three remaining sites by the end of January 2003. We acquired these operations to broaden our base in the consumer electronics industry, to expand our global footprint and to strengthen our relationship with Philips. Simultaneous with the purchase, we entered into a four year agreement with Philips to provide design and engineering services, new product introduction, prototype and test services, procurement and manufacture of a wide range of consumer products. The transaction will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Total consideration paid was approximately $210.0 million in cash. Funding for this acquisition was provided by current working capital. While management currently anticipates that the remaining portions of the transaction will close by the end of January 2003, there is no assurance that we will ultimately consummate the remaining portions of the acquisition. On September 1, 2002, we announced that we had entered into an agreement with Quantum Corporation (Quantum) to purchase certain operations in Penang, Malaysia. Consummation of the acquisition is subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including government approval. We intend to acquire these operations in an effort to broaden our base of manufacturing for the computing and storage sector in Asia and to further strengthen our relationship with Quantum. While management currently anticipates that the transaction will close in the first half of fiscal 2003, there is no assurance that we will ultimately consummate the acquisition. During fiscal year 2002, we continued construction of our greenfield expansion in Guangzhou, China, which is expected to be completed during fiscal 2003. 17 Table of Contents See Factors Affecting Future Results We may not achieve expected profitability from our acquisitions. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. Management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances. We have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. For further discussion of our significant accounting policies, refer to Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts related to receivables not expected to be collected from our customers. This allowance is based on managements assessment of specific customer balances, considering the age of receivables and financial stability of the customer. If there is an adverse change in the financial condition of our customers, or if actual defaults are higher than provided for, an addition to the allowance may be necessary. We purchase inventory based on forecasted demand and record inventory at the lower of cost or market. Management regularly assesses inventory valuation based on current and forecasted usage and other lower of cost or market considerations. If actual market conditions or our customers product demands are less favorable than those projected, additional valuation adjustments may be necessary. We review property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of property, plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the projected cash flows the property, plant and equipment are expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the property exceeds its fair market value. The impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management, including revenue and cash flow projections. Circumstances that may lead to impairment of property, plant and equipment include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand and the restructuring of our operations as a result of a change in our business strategy. We have recorded intangible assets (including goodwill) based on third party valuations, in connection with business acquisitions. Estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are determined by management based on an assessment of the period over which the asset is expected to contribute to future cash flows. The allocation of amortizable intangible assets impacts the amounts allocable to goodwill. In accordance with SFAS 142, which we early adopted effective September 1, 2001, we completed the transitional impairment test during the second quarter of fiscal 2002 and determined that no impairment existed as of the date of adoption. We are required to perform goodwill impairment tests at least on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from its estimated future cash flow. We completed the annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 and determined that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test. The impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management, including revenue and cash flow projections at the reporting unit level. Circumstances that may lead to impairment of goodwill include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand, and the restructuring of our operations as a result of a change in our business strategy. We recognized restructuring charges in fiscal 2002 and 2001 related to reductions in workforce, re sizing and closure of facilities and the transition of certain facilities into new customer development sites. These charges were recorded pursuant to formal plans developed and approved by management. The 18 Table of Contents recognition of restructuring charges required that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature, timing and amount of costs associated with these plans. The estimates of future liabilities may change, requiring additional restructuring charges or the reduction of liabilities already recorded. At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with the restructuring programs. For further discussion of our restructuring programs, refer to Note 13 Restructuring to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain operating data as a percentage of net revenue: Years Ended August 31, 2002 2001 2000 Net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenue 90.6 90.9 89.9 Gross profit 9.4 9.1 10.1 Selling, general and administrative expense 5.7 4.3 3.7 Research and development 0.2 0.2 0.1 Amortization of intangibles 0.4 0.1 0.1 Acquisitions and merger related charges 0.2 0.2 0.2 Restructuring and other charges 1.5 0.6 Operating income 1.4 3.7 6.0 Interest income (0.3 ) (0.2 ) (0.2 ) Interest expense 0.4 0.1 0.2 Income before income taxes 1.3 3.8 6.0 Income taxes 0.3 1.1 1.9 Net income 1.0 % 2.7 % 4.1 % Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2002 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2001 Net Revenue. Our net revenue decreased 18.1% to $3.5 billion for fiscal year 2002, down from $4.3 billion in fiscal year 2001. The decrease was due to a 49.3% decrease in production of computing and storage products, a 37.5% decrease in production of peripheral products and a 13.7% decrease in production of networking products due to softening demand in those sectors. These decreases were offset in part by 58.1% and 27.5% increases in production of instrumentation and medical and consumer products, respectively, due to the addition of new customers and organic growth in those sectors. Foreign source revenue represented 60.6% of our net revenue for fiscal year 2002 and 50.3% of revenue for fiscal 2001. The increase in foreign source revenue was primarily attributable to incremental revenue resulting from our acquisitions in England, France, Italy, Malaysia and Scotland. The percentage of foreign source revenue also increased as a result of the current economic conditions in the U.S. As our overall revenue has fallen, our U.S. based revenues have decreased proportionally more than the decreases in the Asian, Latin American and European markets. Gross Profit. Gross profit increased to 9.4% in fiscal year 2002 from 9.1% in fiscal year 2001 primarily due to an increase in the portion of manufacturing based revenue and due to cost reductions realized from our restructuring activities during the last six quarters. Selling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $203.8 million (5.7% of net revenue) in fiscal year 2002 from $184.1 million (4.3% of net revenue) in 19 Table of Contents fiscal year 2001. This dollar increase was attributable to locations acquired in late fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2002 and to a full years operations in facilities that were under construction or starting production during fiscal 2001. The increase as a percentage of net revenue was impacted by the increase in absolute dollars as well as by decreased revenues in fiscal year 2002. Research and Development. Research and development expenses in fiscal year 2002 increased to $7.9 million from $6.4 million in fiscal year 2001 but remained at 0.2% of net revenue for each of the years ended August 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Despite the recent economic conditions that negatively impacted the demand for our services, we continue to engage in research and development activities, including design of circuit board assemblies and the related production process, development of new products and new failure analysis techniques at our historical levels. Amortization of Intangibles. We recorded $15.1 million of amortization of intangibles in fiscal year 2002 as compared to $5.8 million in fiscal year 2001. This increase was attributable to the amortization of amortizable intangible assets arising from our acquisitions in England and Italy during late fiscal 2001 and in France, Malaysia, Scotland and the United States during fiscal 2002. We elected to early adopt Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), effective the beginning of fiscal 2002. In accordance with SFAS 142, we ceased amortizing goodwill for fiscal 2002. For additional information regarding purchased intangibles, see Acquisitions and Expansion above, Note 1(f) Intangible Assets, Note 4 Intangible Assets and Note 12 Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Acquisitions and Merger Related Charges. During fiscal year 2002, we incurred $7.6 million in acquisition related charges consisting of increased incremental staffing and support costs and legal and professional fees associated with the acquisitions in France, Malaysia, Scotland and the United States. See Note 12 Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Restructuring and Other Charges. During fiscal 2002, we incurred $52.1 million in restructuring charges related to reductions in our cost structure. These charges included reductions in workforce, re sizing of facilities and the transition of certain facilities into new customer development sites. These charges were largely intended to align our capacity and infrastructure to anticipated customer demand. Approximately $7.2 million related to asset write off costs, $10.6 million to lease exit costs, $32.1 million to employee severance and termination benefit costs and $2.2 million in other restructuring costs. As of August 31, 2002, total liabilities of $21.4 million related to these restructuring activities are expected to be paid out within the next twelve months. The employee severance and benefit termination costs included in our restructuring charges are related to the elimination of approximately 2,800 employees during fiscal 2002. The majority of these employees were engaged in direct and indirect manufacturing activities in various facilities around the world. Costs related to lease commitments consist primarily of future lease payments for facilities vacated as a result of the consolidation of facilities. The fixed asset impairment charge primarily results from a decision made to vacate several smaller facilities in the United States, Europe and Asia due to current macroeconomic conditions. For additional information regarding restructuring costs, see Note 13 Restructuring to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We currently expect to incur approximately $60 million to $80 million in additional restructuring charges during fiscal 2003 related to the closure of our Boise, Idaho plant and certain other restructuring activities, which are being evaluated in light of the current macroeconomic conditions. Interest Income. Interest income increased to $9.8 million in fiscal year 2002 from $8.2 million in fiscal year 2001 reflecting increased income on greater cash balances resulting from positive cash flow from operations during fiscal 2002 and the proceeds from our issuance of convertible notes completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2001. See Note 5 Notes Payable, Long Term Debt and Long Term Lease Obligations to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 20 Table of Contents Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $13.1 million in fiscal year 2002, from $5.9 million in fiscal year 2001, primarily as a result of our issuance of convertible notes near the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2001 and imputed interest on deferred acquisition payments related to the Marconi acquisition. Income Taxes. In fiscal year 2002, our effective tax rate decreased to 22.4% from 28.7% in fiscal year 2001. The tax rate is predominantly a function of the mix of domestic versus international income from operations. As the proportion of our income derived from foreign sources has increased, our effective tax rate has decreased as our international operations have historically been taxed at a lower rate than in the United States, primarily due to tax holidays granted to our sites in Malaysia, China and Hungary that expire through 2010. Such tax holidays are subject to conditions with which we expect to continue to comply. In addition to the increase in foreign source income, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2002, as compared to fiscal 2001 decreased due to the mix of the effective tax rates in the tax jurisdictions in which our restructuring and acquisition related charges were incurred and the tax treatment of the amortization of intangibles in each jurisdiction. See Note 6 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2001 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2000 Net Revenue. Our net revenue increased 21.7% to $4.3 billion for fiscal year 2001, up from $3.6 billion in fiscal year 2000. The increase was due to a 111.4% increase in production of instrumentation and medical products, a 74.9% increase in production of consumer products, a 45.9% increase in production of telecommunications products, a 39.4% increase in production of networking products, and a 14.5% increase in production of automotive products. Foreign source revenue represented 50.3% of our net revenue for fiscal year 2001 and 43.5% of revenue for fiscal 2000. The increase in foreign source revenue was attributable to increased production in our international locations, primarily in our Mexican, Malaysian and Hungarian facilities, and from incremental revenue resulting from the Marconi acquisitions in England and Italy during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. Gross Profit. Gross profit decreased to 9.1% in fiscal year 2001 from 10.1% in fiscal year 2000 reflecting a higher content of material based revenue as well as relatively lower levels of capacity utilization than in fiscal 2000. Selling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $184.1 million (4.3% of net revenue) in fiscal year 2001 from $132.7 million (3.7% of net revenue) in fiscal year 2000. This increase was primarily due to increases in staffing and related departmental expenses at all of our locations along with increases in information systems staff to support the expansion of our business. Research and Development. Research and development expenses in fiscal year 2001 increased to $6.4 million (0.2% of net revenue) from $4.8 million (0.1% of net revenue) in fiscal year 2000 as a result of the establishment of a new Design Center located in our Michigan facility as well as expanded services in other locations. Amortization of Intangibles. We recorded $5.8 million of amortization of intangibles in fiscal year 2001 as compared to $2.7 million in fiscal year 2000. This increase is attributable to the amortization of the goodwill arising from the Marconi acquisition during fiscal 2001. Acquisition and Merger Related Charge. During fiscal year 2001, we incurred $6.6 million in acquisition related charges consisting of increased incremental staffing and support costs and legal and professional fees associated with the Marconi acquisition. Restructuring and Other Charges. During fiscal 2001, we incurred $27.4 million in restructuring and other charges related to reductions in our cost structure. These charges include reductions in workforce, re sizing of facilities and the transition of certain facilities into new customer development sites. Approximately $11.5 million related to asset write off costs, $5.6 million to lease exit costs, $8.9 million to 21 Table of Contents employee severance and benefit termination costs and $1.4 million in other restructuring costs. As of August 31, 2001, liabilities relating to these restructuring activities, totaling $5.5 million, are expected to be paid out within the next twelve months. Interest Income. Interest income increased to $8.2 million in fiscal year 2001 from $7.4 million in fiscal year 2000 reflecting increased income on greater cash balances resulting from the issuance of convertible notes completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2001. Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased to $5.9 million in fiscal year 2001, from $7.6 million in fiscal year 2000, primarily as a result of decreased short term borrowings under our revolving line of credit throughout the year, offset by additional expense accrued on the convertible notes issued in the third quarter of fiscal 2001. Income Taxes. In fiscal year 2001, our effective tax rate decreased to 28.7% from 31.5% in fiscal year 2000. The effective tax rate is predominantly a function of the mix of domestic versus international income from operations. Our international operations have been taxed at a lower rate than in the United States, primarily due to tax holidays granted to our sites in Malaysia, China and Hungary. Such tax holidays are subject to conditions with which we expect to comply. See Note 6 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2001. Quarterly Results (Unaudited) The following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly financial information for the 2002 and 2001 fiscal years.

We also recorded charges of $27.6 million ($22.3 million after tax), $10.4 million ($7.7 million after tax) and $14.1 million ($10.1 million after tax) related to the restructuring of our business during the quarters ended August 31, 2002, February 28, 2002 and November 30, 2001, respectively. Operating income excluding these charges was $33.8 million (3.4% of net revenue), $28.9 million (3.4% of net revenue), $17.7 million (2.2% of net revenue) and $27.3 million (3.1% of net revenue) for the quarters ended August 31, 2002, May 31, 2002, February 28, 2002 and November 30, 2001, respectively. Net income excluding these charges was $26.6 million (2.7% of net revenue), $21.5 million (2.5% of net revenue), $11.7 million (1.4% of net revenue) and $19.8 million (2.2% of net revenue) and diluted earnings per share was $0.13, $0.11, $0.06 and $0.10 for the quarters ended August 31, 2002, May 31, 2002, February 28, 2002 and November 30, 2001, respectively. (2) In connection with the acquisition of certain manufacturing facilities of Marconi, we recorded acquisition charges of $1.9 million ($1.2 million after tax), $3.8 million ($2.3 million after tax), and $0.8 million ($0.6 million after tax) during the quarters ended August 31, 2001, May 31, 2001 and February 28, 2001, respectively. We also recorded charges of $11.8 million ($11.0 million after tax) and $15.6 million ($10.6 million after tax) related to the restructuring of our business during the quarters ended August 31, 2001 and May 31, 2001, respectively. Operating income excluding these charges was $31.6 million (3.4% of net revenue), $41.7 million (4.0% of net revenue) and $59.2 million (4.9% of net revenue) for the quarters ended August 31, 2001, May 31, 2001 and February 28, 2001, respectively. Net income excluding these charges was $23.5 million (2.5% of net revenue), $31.7 million (3.0% of net revenue) and $41.3 million (3.4% of net revenue) and diluted earnings per share was $0.12, $0.16 and $0.21 for the quarters ended August 31, 2001, May 31, 2001 and February 28, 2001, respectively. 24 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources At August 31, 2002, we had cash and cash equivalents balances totaling $640.7 million, total notes payable, long term debt and capital lease obligations of $363.4 million and $600.0 million available for borrowings under our credit facility and accounts receivable securitization program. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2002 was $554.1 million. This consisted of $34.7 million of net income, $188.3 million of depreciation and amortization, $80.4 million from decreases in accounts receivable, $154.5 million from decreases of inventory, $67.8 million from increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and $28.6 million of non cash restructuring charges. The decrease in inventory was due to reduced levels of business during fiscal 2002. Consistent with the last half of fiscal 2001, we continued to experience reduced levels of demand from many of our customers in response to the general economic downturn. Inventory levels were decreased in line with new levels of expected demand. The decrease in accounts receivable was due to the decreased revenue during fiscal 2002, accompanied by improved collections of outstanding balances. The increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was a result of an increased emphasis on cash management as well as the timing of purchases near year end. Net cash used in investing activities of $350.4 million for fiscal 2002 consisted of our capital expenditures of $85.5 million for construction and equipment worldwide and cash paid of $278.6 million in the acquisition of businesses, net of $13.7 million of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment. Consistent with the reduced levels of demand we experienced during fiscal 2002, our capital expenditures were significantly lower in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. We also continued construction of a new manufacturing facility in Guangzhou, China to support expected future capacity needs in this low cost region. Net cash provided by financing activities of $6.4 million for fiscal 2002 resulted primarily from $14.7 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock for the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan, offset by the repayment of an installment of principal on our private placement debt. See Note 5 Notes Payable, Long Term Debt and Long Term Lease Obligations and Note 8 Stockholders Equity to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We may need to finance future growth and any corresponding working capital needs with additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility, as well as additional public and private offerings of our debt and equity. During the first quarter of fiscal 1999, we filed a shelf registration statement registering the potential sale of debt and equity securities in the future, from time to time, to augment our liquidity and capital resources. In August 2000, we effectively increased the amount of unissued securities under our shelf registration statement from $750 million to $1.5 billion. In May 2001, we issued a total of $345.0 million, 20 year, 1.75% convertible subordinated notes at par, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $337.5 million. The notes mature on May 15, 2021 and pay interest semiannually on May 15 and November 15. Each note is convertible at any time after the date of original issuance and prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date by the holder at a conversion rate of 24.368 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes. Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on May 15 in the years 2004, 2006, 2009 and 2014 at par plus accrued interest. We may choose to pay the purchase price in cash or common stock valued at 95% of its market price. We may redeem all or a portion of the notes for cash at any time on or after May 18, 2004 at 100% of principal plus accrued interest. In June 2000, we sold 13.0 million shares of our common stock, which generated net proceeds to us of approximately $525.4 million. These offerings were made pursuant to that registration statement. In August 2000, we established a $225.0 million account receivables securitization program with a syndicate of banks with an expiration date in August 2001, which was later extended to November 2001. We renewed the facility with a new funding capacity of $100.0 million in November 2001 and again in May 2002. The facility expires in May 2003. There were no borrowings outstanding under the facility at August 31, 2002. Interest is payable based on designated commercial paper rates plus agreed upon margins. We have a committed line of credit facility in place with a syndicate of banks that provides up to $500.0 million of working capital borrowing capacity, which expires April 6, 2003. There were no 25 Table of Contents borrowings outstanding under the facility at August 31, 2002. We allowed an additional $250.0 million 364 day credit facility to expire in May 2002, given our current cash balance, our existing credit facility and the accounts receivable securitization program. We expect to renew our credit facilities during the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Our working capital requirements and capital expenditures could continue to increase in order to support future expansions of our operations. It is possible that future acquisitions may be significant and may require the payment of cash. For example, we have entered into a number of transactions in which we acquired or will acquire OEM facilities for cash during the first half of fiscal 2003. See Acquisitions and Expansion. Future liquidity needs will also depend on fluctuations in levels of inventory, the timing of expenditures for new equipment, levels of shipments and changes in volumes of customer orders. We believe that during fiscal year 2003, our capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, will be approximately $90 million, principally for machinery, equipment, facilities and related expenses. We believe that our level of resources, which includes cash on hand, available borrowings, and funds provided by operations, will be more than adequate to fund these expenditures, the expected cash needed for announced acquisitions and working capital requirements for fiscal 2003. Consummating any significant amount of additional acquisition opportunities, which we regularly explore, would increase our capital needs and, possibly, result in our need to increase our borrowings and to access public and private debt and equity markets. There can be no assurance, however, that we would be successful in raising additional debt or equity with terms that we consider acceptable. See Factors Affecting Future Results We may not achieve expected profitability from our acquisitions, We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our international operations, which are subject to greater volatility and often require more management time and expense to achieve profitability than our domestic operations. Our contractual obligations for future minimum lease payments under non cancelable lease arrangements and short and long term debt arrangements as of August 31, 2002 are summarized below. We do not participate in, or secure financing for any unconsolidated limited purpose entities. Non cancelable purchase commitments do not typically extend beyond the normal lead time of several weeks at most. Purchase orders beyond this time frame are typically cancelable. Payments due by period (in thousands) Less than After 5 Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years Years Notes payable, long term debt and long term lease obligations $ 363,360 $ 8,692 $ 9,668 $ $ 345,000 Operating leases 139,361 27,028 51,465 23,829 37,039 Other long term obligations 39,500 39,500 Total contractual cash obligations $ 542,221 $ 35,720 $ 100,633 $ 23,829 $ 382,039 The notes payable and long term debt require compliance with a financial covenant based on the ratio of total debt to total capitalization, calculated on a consolidated basis. In addition, they require compliance with operating covenants, which limit, among other things, the incurrence of additional indebtedness by us and our subsidiaries. We were in compliance with the respective covenants as of August 31, 2002. 26 Table of Contents FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE RESULTS Our operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our annual and quarterly operating results are affected by a number of factors, including: adverse changes in general economic conditions the level and timing of customer orders the level of capacity utilization of our manufacturing facilities and associated fixed costs the composition of the costs of revenue between materials, labor and manufacturing overhead price competition our level of experience in manufacturing a particular product the degree of automation used in our assembly process the efficiencies achieved in managing inventories and fixed assets fluctuations in materials costs and availability of materials the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales, customer product delivery requirements and shortages of components or labor. The volume and timing of orders placed by our customers vary due to variation in demand for our customers products, our customers inventory management, new product introductions and manufacturing strategy changes, and consolidations among our customers. In the past, changes in customer orders have had a significant effect on our results of operations due to corresponding changes in the level of overhead absorption. Any one or a combination of these factors could adversely affect our annual and quarterly results of operations in the future. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Quarterly Results. Because we depend on a limited number of customers, a reduction in sales to any one of our customers could cause a significant decline in our revenue. For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2002, our four largest customers accounted for approximately 50% of our net revenue and 27 customers accounted for over 95% of our net revenue. For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2002, Cisco Systems, Inc. and Marconi Communications, accounted for approximately 24% and 13% of our net revenue, respectively. We are dependent upon the continued growth, viability and financial stability of our customers whose industries have experienced rapid technological change, short product life cycles, consolidation, and pricing and margin pressures. We expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue. Consolidation among our customers may further reduce the number of customers that generate a significant percentage of our revenues and exposes us to increased risks relating to dependence on a small number of customers. A significant reduction in sales to any of our customers or a customer exerting significant pricing and margin pressures on us, would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In the past, some of our customers have terminated their manufacturing arrangements with us or have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of manufacturing services ordered from us. We cannot assure you that present or future customers will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us or significantly change, reduce or delay the amount of manufacturing services ordered from us. If they do, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, we generate significant account receivables in connection with providing manufacturing services to our customers. If one or more of our customers were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay for the manufacturing services provided by us, our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Business Customers and Marketing. 27 Table of Contents Our customers may be adversely affected by rapid technological change. Our customers compete in markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and continuous improvements in products and services. These conditions frequently result in short product life cycles. Our success will depend largely on the success achieved by our customers in developing and marketing their products. If technologies or standards supported by our customers products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance, our business could be materially adversely affected. We depend on the electronics industry, which continually produces technologically advanced products with short life cycles; our inability to continually manufacture such products on a cost effective basis would harm our business. Factors affecting the electronics industry in general could seriously harm our customers and, as a result, us. These factors include: the inability of our customers to adapt to rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards, which result in short product life cycles; the inability of our customers to develop and market their products, some of which are new and untested, the potential that our customers products may become obsolete or the failure of our customers products to gain widespread commercial acceptance; and recessionary periods in our customers markets. If any of these factors materialize, our business would suffer. In addition, if we are unable to offer technologically advanced, cost effective, quick response manufacturing service to customers, demand for our services will also decline. A substantial portion of our net sales is derived from our ability to offer complete service solutions for our customers. For example, if we fail to maintain high quality design and engineering services, our net sales may significantly decline. Most of our customers do not commit to long term production schedules, which makes it difficult for us to schedule production and achieve maximum efficiency of our manufacturing capacity. The volume and timing of sales to our customers may vary due to: variation in demand for our customers products our customers attempts to manage their inventory electronic design changes changes in our customers manufacturing strategy acquisitions of or consolidations among customers recessionary conditions in customers industries Due in part to these factors, most of our customers do not commit to firm production schedules for more than one quarter in advance. Our inability to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity. In the past, we have been required to increase staffing and other expenses in order to meet the anticipated demand of our customers. Anticipated orders from many of our customers have, in the past, failed to materialize or delivery schedules have been deferred as a result of changes in our customers business needs, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations. On other occasions, our customers have required rapid increases in production, which have placed an excessive burden on our resources. Such customer order fluctuations and deferrals have had a material adverse effect on us in the past, and we may experience such effects in the future. In addition, the current business environment resulting from uncertainties relating to terrorist activities and economic recession has made planning even more complex. A business 28 Table of Contents downturn resulting from any of these external factors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Business Backlog. Our customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or delay production. Electronics manufacturing service providers must provide increasingly rapid product turnaround for their customers. We generally do not obtain firm, long term purchase commitments from our customers and we continue to experience reduced lead times in customer orders. Customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or delay production for a number of reasons. The success of our customers products in the market affects our business. Cancellations, reductions or delay by a significant customer or by a group of customers could negatively impact our operating results. In addition, we make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, personnel needs and other resource requirements, based on our estimate of customer requirements. The short term nature of our customers commitments and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products reduces our ability to accurately estimate the future requirements of those customers. On occasion, customers may require rapid increases in production, which can stress our resources and reduce operating margins. In addition, because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand can harm our gross margins and operating results. We compete with numerous providers of electronic manufacturing services, including our current or potential customers who may decide to manufacture all of their products internally. The electronic manufacturing services business is highly competitive. We compete against numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers, including Celestica, Inc., Flextronics International, Sanmina SCI Corporation and Solectron Corporation. In addition, we may in the future encounter competition from other large electronic manufacturers that are selling, or may begin to sell, electronic manufacturing services. Most of our competitors have international operations and some have substantially greater manufacturing, financial, research and development, and marketing resources than us. We also face potential competition from the manufacturing operations of our current and potential customers, who are continually evaluating the merits of manufacturing products internally versus the advantages of outsourcing. See Business Competition. Increased competition may result in decreased demand or prices for our services. The electronics manufacturing services industry is highly competitive. We compete against numerous U.S. and foreign electronics manufacturing services providers with global operations, as well as those who operate on a local or regional basis. In addition, current and prospective customers continually evaluate the merits of manufacturing products internally. Consolidation in the electronics manufacturing services industry results in a continually changing competitive landscape. The consolidation trend in the industry also results in larger and more geographically diverse competitors who have significant combined resources with which to compete against us. Some of our competitors have substantially greater managerial, manufacturing, engineering, technical, financial, systems, research and development, sales and marketing resources than we do. These competitors may: respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies; have greater name recognition, critical mass and geographic and market presence; be better able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities; adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements; 29 Table of Contents devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their services; and be better positioned to compete on price for their services. We may be operating at a cost disadvantage compared to manufacturers who have greater direct buying power from component suppliers, distributors and raw material suppliers or who have lower cost structures as a result of their geographic location or the services they provide. As a result, competitors may procure a competitive advantage and obtain business from our customers. Our manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant proprietary protection, and companies with greater resources or a greater market presence may enter our market or increase their competition with us. We also expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products or services, to reduce their current products or service sales prices and to introduce new products or services that may offer greater performance and improved pricing. Any of these could cause a decline in sales, loss of market acceptance of our products or services, profit margin compression, or loss of market share. If we do not manage our growth effectively, our profitability could decline. We have grown rapidly. Our ability to manage growth effectively will require us to continue to implement and improve our operational, financial and management information systems; continue to develop the management skills of our managers and supervisors; and continue to train, motivate and manage our employees. Our failure to effectively manage growth could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See Selected Consolidated Financial Data and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Any delay in integrating our new information systems could disrupt our operations and cause unanticipated increases in our costs. We have completed the installation of an Enterprise Resource Planning system in sixteen of our manufacturing sites and in our corporate location. We are in the process of installing this system in our remaining plants, which will replace the current Manufacturing Resource Planning system, and financial information systems. Any delay in the implementation of these new information systems could result in material adverse consequences, including disruption of operations, loss of information and unanticipated increases in cost. We may not achieve expected profitability from our acquisitions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate the operations and management of our recent acquisitions. Similarly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate or, if consummated, successfully integrate the operations and management of future acquisitions. Acquisitions involve significant risks, which could have a material adverse effect on us, including: Financial risks, such as (1) potential liabilities of the acquired businesses; (2) the dilutive effect of the issuance of additional equity securities; (3) the incurrence of additional debt; (4) the financial impact of valuing goodwill and other intangible assets involved in any acquisitions; and (5) possible adverse tax and accounting effects. Operating risks, such as (1) the diversion of managements attention to the assimilation of the businesses to be acquired; (2) the risk that the acquired businesses will fail to maintain the quality of services that we have historically provided; (3) the need to implement financial and other systems and add management resources; (4) the risk that key employees of the acquired businesses will leave after the acquisition; and (5) unforeseen difficulties in the acquired operations. We have acquired and will continue to pursue the acquisition of manufacturing and supply chain management operations from OEMs. In these acquisitions, the divesting OEM will typically enter a supply arrangement with the acquiror. Therefore, the competition for these acquisitions is intense. In addition, certain OEMs may not choose to consummate these acquisitions with us because of our current 30 Table of Contents supply arrangements with other OEMs. If we are unable to attract and consummate some of these acquisition opportunities, our growth could be adversely impacted. Our ability to achieve the expected benefits of the outsourcing opportunities associated with these acquisitions is subject to risks, including our ability to meet volume, product quality, timeliness and pricing requirements, and our ability to achieve the OEMs expected cost reduction. In addition, when acquiring manufacturing operations, we may receive limited commitments to firm production schedules. Accordingly, in these circumstances, we may spend substantial amounts purchasing these manufacturing facilities and assume significant contractual and other obligations with no guaranteed levels of revenues. We may also not achieve expected profitability from these arrangements. As a result of these and other risks, these outsourcing opportunities may not be profitable. We depend on a limited number of suppliers for components that are critical to our manufacturing processes. A shortage of these components or an increase in their price could interrupt our operations and reduce our profits. Substantially all of our net revenue is derived from turnkey manufacturing in which we provide materials procurement. While most of our significant long term customer contracts permit quarterly or other periodic adjustments to pricing based on decreases and increases in component prices and other factors, we typically bear the risk of component price increases that occur between any such re pricings or, if such re pricing is not permitted, during the balance of the term of the particular customer contract. Accordingly, certain component price increases could adversely affect our gross profit margins. Almost all of the products we manufacture require one or more components that are available from only a single source. Some of these components are allocated from time to time in response to supply shortages. In some cases, supply shortages will substantially curtail production of all assemblies using a particular component. In addition, at various times industry wide shortages of electronic components have occurred, particularly of memory and logic devices. Such circumstances have produced insignificant levels of short term interruption of our operations, but could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the future. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Business Components Procurement. We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our international operations, which are subject to greater volatility and often require more management time and expense to achieve profitability than our domestic operations. We derived over 60% of our revenues from international operations in fiscal year 2002. We currently operate outside the United States in Brussels, Belgium; Contagem, Brazil; Panyu, China; Coventry, England; Brest and Meung sur Loire, France; Tiszaujvaros, Hungary; Dublin, Ireland; Bergamo and Marcianise, Italy; Penang, Malaysia; Chihuahua and Guadalajara, Mexico and Ayr and Livingston, Scotland. We continually consider additional opportunities to make foreign acquisitions and construct new foreign facilities. Our international operations may be subject to a number of risks, including: difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations political and economic instability unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and laws longer customer payment cycles and difficulty collecting accounts receivable export duties, import controls and trade barriers (including quotas) governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to us from our operations outside the United States burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and labor practices fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could affect local payroll, utility and other expenses 31 Table of Contents inability to utilize net operating losses incurred by our foreign operations to reduce our U.S. income taxes In addition, several of the countries where we operate have emerging or developing economies, which may be subject to greater currency volatility, negative growth, high inflation, limited availability of foreign exchange and other risks. These factors may harm our results of operations and any measures that we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies and other risks of our international operations may not be effective. In our experience, entry into new international markets requires considerable management time as well as start up expenses for market development, hiring and establishing office facilities before any significant revenues are generated. As a result, initial operations in a new market may operate at low margins or may be unprofitable. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources. We may not be able to maintain our engineering, technological and manufacturing process expertise. The markets for our manufacturing and engineering services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving process development. The continued success of our business will depend upon our ability to: hire, retain and expand our qualified engineering and technical personnel; maintain technological leadership; develop and market manufacturing services that meet changing customer needs; and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes on a cost effective and timely basis. Although we believe that our operations use the assembly and testing technologies, equipment and processes that are currently required by our customers, we cannot be certain that we will develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future. The emergence of new technology industry standards or customer requirements may render our equipment, inventory or processes obsolete or noncompetitive. In addition, we may have to acquire new assembly and testing technologies and equipment to remain competitive. The acquisition and implementation of new technologies and equipment may require significant expense or capital investment, which could reduce our operating margins and our operating results. Our failure to anticipate and adapt to our customers changing technological needs and requirements could have an adverse effect on our business. We do not have employment agreements with any of our key personnel, the loss of which could hurt our operations. Our continued success depends largely on the efforts and skills of our key managerial and technical employees. The loss of the services of certain of these key employees or an inability to attract or retain qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on us. We do not have employment agreements or non competition agreements with our key employees. Compliance or the failure to comply with current and future environmental regulations could cause us significant expense. We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process. If we fail to comply with any present and future regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production. In addition, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment, or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations. 32 Table of Contents Certain of our existing stockholders have significant control. Our executive officers, directors, principal stockholders, and their affiliates collectively beneficially own 22.0% of our outstanding common stock, of which William D. Morean, our Chairman of the Board, beneficially owns 16.9%. As a result, our executive officers, directors, principal stockholders and their affiliates have significant influence over (1) the election of our Board of Directors, (2) the approval or disapproval of any other matters requiring stockholder approval, and (3) the affairs and policies of Jabil. Our stock price may be volatile due to factors beyond our control. Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and could fluctuate substantially in the future, based on a variety of factors, including future announcements covering us or our key customers or competitors, government regulations, litigation, changes in earnings estimates by analysts, fluctuations in quarterly operating results, or general conditions in the contract manufacturing, networking, telecommunications, computing and storage, instrumentation and medical, computer, peripherals, automotive and consumer products industries. Furthermore, stock prices for many companies, and high technology companies in particular, fluctuate widely for reasons that may be unrelated to their operating results. Those fluctuations and general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions or international currency fluctuations and demand for our services, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, Stockholder Rights Plan and Delaware Law may discourage certain takeover transactions. The Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws each contain certain provisions that may, in effect, discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of Jabil or unsolicited acquisition proposals from taking place. During fiscal year 2002, we adopted a stockholder rights agreement, which could make it considerably more difficult or costly for a person or group to acquire Jabil in a transaction that our board of directors opposes. These provisions, alone or in combination with each other, may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of common stock, or could limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests. We are subject to the risk of increased taxes. We base our tax position upon the anticipated nature and conduct of our business and upon our understanding of the tax laws of the various countries in which we have assets or conduct activities. Our tax position, however, is subject to review and possible challenge by taxing authorities and to possible changes in law. We cannot determine in advance the extent to which some jurisdictions may assess additional tax or interest and penalties on such additional taxes. Several countries in which we are located allow for tax holidays or provide other tax incentives to attract and retain business. We have obtained holidays or other incentives where available. Our taxes could increase if certain tax holidays or incentives are retracted, or if they are not renewed upon expiration, or tax rates applicable to us in such jurisdictions are otherwise increased. In addition, further acquisitions may cause our effective tax rate to increase. We are subject to risks of currency fluctuations and hedging operations. A portion of our business is conducted in the Chinese renminbi, the Euro, the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real. In recent years, the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso have experienced significant devaluations. Changes in exchange rates between these and other currencies and the U.S. dollar will affect our cost of sales, operating margins and revenues. We cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations. We use financial instruments, primarily forward purchase contracts, to hedge U.S. dollar and other foreign currency commitments arising from trade accounts payable and fixed purchase obligations. 33 Table of Contents Because we hedge only fixed obligations, we do not expect that these hedging activities will harm our results of operations or cash flows. Our hedging activities, however, may be unsuccessful, and we may change or reduce our hedging activities in the future. As a result, we may experience significant unexpected expenses from fluctuations in exchange rates. An adverse change in the interest rates for our borrowings could adversely affect our financial condition. We pay interest on outstanding borrowings under our $500 million revolving credit facility at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base interest rates. As of August 31, 2002, we did not have outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. We also have funding costs associated with the asset backed securitization. Costs are, in part, based on commercial paper rates. As of August 31, 2002, we did not have any outstanding borrowings under the asset backed securitization. An adverse change in the base rates upon which our interest rate is determined could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Currency Exchange Risks We transact business in various foreign countries and enter into foreign currency contracts, specifically forward contracts to hedge transactional exposure. Transactional exposure primarily consists of vendor payments, payroll and local expenses. We adopted FAS No. 133, as amended by FAS 137 and 138, and as such, all foreign currency forward contracts are reported on the balance sheet at fair value. As of August 31, 2002, we had no outstanding forward contracts. Forward contracts generally expire in less than a month and settle in Euro, British Pounds, Mexican Peso and Japanese Yen. Interest Rate Risk A portion of our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio. We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. We place cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions. We protect our invested principal funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities and by constantly positioning the portfolio to respond appropriately to a reduction in credit rating of any investment issuer, guarantor or depository to levels below the credit ratings dictated by our investment policy. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. As of August 31, 2002, the outstanding amount in the investment portfolio was $237.1 million, comprised mainly of money market funds with an average return of 1.76%. Our existing debt is at fixed rates. We have private placement debt with a principal balance of $16.7 million, maturing in two equal payments in May 2003 and May 2004, which has a fixed rate of interest at 6.89%. We are not exposed to interest rate risk on the private placement debt because (i) the interest on the principal amount is fixed at 6.89% and (ii) the principal payments are fixed. We have also issued convertible debt with a principal maturity of $345 million due in May 2021. The notes can be redeemed by the holder at par value plus accrued interest on May 15, 2004, May 15, 2006, May 15, 2009 and May 15, 2014. We are not exposed to interest rate risk on the convertible debt because (i) the interest on the principal amount is fixed at 1.75%, (ii) the principal payable at maturity is fixed and (iii) the conversion into our common stock is fixed. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Factors Affecting Future Results We depend on a limited number of suppliers for components that are critical to our manufacturing processes. A shortage of these components or an increase in their price could interrupt our operations and reduce our profits, We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our international operations, which are subject to greater volatility and often require more management time and expense to achieve profitability than our domestic operations, and An adverse change in the interest rates for our borrowings could adversely affect our financial condition.
