Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation Overview This Annual Report on Form 10 K contains certain statements that are, or may be deemed to be, forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and are made in reliance upon the protections provided by such acts for forward looking statements. These forward looking statements (such as when we describe what will, may or should occur, what we plan, intend, estimate, believe, expect or anticipate will occur, and other similar statements) include, but are not limited to, statements regarding future sales and operating results, future prospects, anticipated benefits of proposed (or future) acquisitions and new facilities, growth, the capabilities and capacities of business operations, any financial or other guidance and all statements that are not based on historical fact, but rather reflect our current expectations concerning future results and events. We make certain assumptions when making forward looking statements, any of which could prove inaccurate, including, but not limited to, statements about our future operating results and business plans. The ultimate correctness of these forward looking statements is dependent upon a number of known and unknown risks and events, and is subject to various uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these statements. The following important factors, among others, could affect future results and events, causing those results and events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward looking statements: business conditions and growth in our customers industries, the electronic manufacturing services industry and the general economy, variability of operating results, our dependence on a limited number of major customers, the potential consolidation of our customer base, availability of components, dependence on certain industries, variability of customer requirements, our ability to successfully negotiate definitive agreements and consummate acquisitions, and to integrate operations following consummation of acquisitions, our ability to take advantage of our restructuring to improve utilization and realize savings, other economic, business and competitive factors affecting our customers, our industry and business generally and other factors that we may not have currently identified or quantified. For a further list and description of various risks, relevant factors and uncertainties that could cause future results or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward looking statements, see the Factors Affecting Future Results section elsewhere in this document. All forward looking statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K are made only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, and we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or correct any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that subsequently occur or which we hereafter become aware of. You should read this document and the documents that we incorporate by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10 K completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We may not update these forward looking statements, even if our situation changes in the future. All forward looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified by these cautionary statements. We are one of the leading worldwide independent providers of turnkey manufacturing services to OEMs in the automotive, computing and storage, consumer products, instrumentation and medical, networking, peripherals and telecommunications industries. The historical growth of the overall EMS industry, which subsided in early to mid 2001 consistent with the overall global economic downturn, was driven by the increasing number of OEMs who were outsourcing their manufacturing requirements. We anticipate that this industry outsourcing trend will continue during the next several years. We derive most of our net revenue under purchase orders from OEM customers. We recognize revenue, net of estimated product return costs, when goods are shipped, title and risk of ownership have passed, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and recoverability is reasonably assured. The volume and timing of orders placed by our customers vary due to several factors, including: variation in demand for our customers products; our customers attempts to manage their inventory; electronic design changes; changes in our customers manufacturing strategies; and acquisitions of or consolidations among our 17 Table of Contents customers. Demand for our customers products depends on, among other things, product life cycles, competitive conditions and general economic conditions. Our cost of revenue includes the cost of electronic components and other materials that comprise the products we manufacture, the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead, and adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory. As a provider of turnkey manufacturing services, we are responsible for procuring components and other materials. This requires us to commit significant working capital to our operations and to manage the purchasing, receiving, inspection and stocking of materials. Although we bear the risk of fluctuations in the cost of materials and excess scrap, we periodically negotiate cost of materials adjustments with our customers. Net revenue from each product that we manufacture consists of an element based on the costs of materials in that product and an element based on the labor and manufacturing overhead costs allocated to that product. We refer to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on materials costs as material based revenue, and to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on labor and manufacturing overhead costs as manufacturing based revenue. Our gross margin for any product depends on the mix between the cost of materials in the product and the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead allocated to the product. We typically realize higher gross margins on manufacturing based revenue than we do on materials based revenue. As we gain experience in manufacturing a product, we usually achieve increased efficiencies, which result in lower labor and manufacturing overhead costs for that product. Our operating results are impacted by the level of capacity utilization of manufacturing facilities, indirect labor and selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high production volume and high capacity utilization. During periods of low production volume, we generally have idle capacity and reduced operating margins. As our capacity has grown during recent years through the construction of new greenfield facilities, the expansion of existing facilities and our acquisition of additional facilities, our selling, general and administrative expenses have increased to support this growth. We have consistently utilized advanced circuit design, production design and manufacturing technologies to meet the needs of our customers. To support this effort, our engineering staff focuses on developing and refining design and manufacturing technologies to meet specific needs of specific customers. Most of the expenses associated with these customer specific efforts are reflected in our cost of revenue. In addition, our engineers engage in R&D of new technologies that apply generally to our operations. The expenses of these R&D activities are reflected in the Research and Development line item in our Consolidated Financial Statements. An important element of our strategy is the expansion of our global production facilities. The majority of our revenue and materials costs worldwide are denominated in U.S. dollars, while our labor and utility costs in plants outside the United States are denominated in local currencies. We hedge these local currency costs, based on our evaluation of the potential exposure as compared to the cost of the hedge, through the purchase of foreign exchange contracts. Changes in the fair market value of such hedging instruments are included in other comprehensive income. See Factors Affecting Future Results We are subject to risks of currency fluctuations and related hedging operations and Note 1(n) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Comprehensive Income to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue. A significant reduction in sales to any of our large customers or a customer exerting significant pricing and margin pressures on us would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In the past, some of our customers have terminated their manufacturing arrangements with us or have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of manufacturing services ordered from us. There can be no assurance that present or future customers will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us or significantly change, reduce or delay the amount of manufacturing services ordered from us. Any such termination of a manufacturing relationship or change, reduction or delay in orders could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. See Factors Affecting Future Results Because we depend on a limited number of customers, a reduction in sales to any one of our 18 Table of Contents customers could cause a significant decline in our revenue and Note 9 Concentration of Risk and Segment Data to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Acquisitions and Expansion The EMS industry experienced rapid growth over a period of years until mid 2001, when the industrys revenue declined as a result of significant cutbacks in its customers production requirements, which was consistent with the overall global economic downturn. Nonetheless, OEMs have continued to turn to outsourcing in order to reduce product cost; achieve accelerated time to market and time to volume production; access advanced design and manufacturing technologies; improve inventory management and purchasing power; and reduce their capital investment in manufacturing. We believe, therefore, that additional acquisition opportunities exist and we regularly evaluate such acquisition opportunities. We also evaluate acquisition opportunities that may arise as a result of consolidation in the EMS industry. We intend to continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions of ancillary services to compliment our service offerings. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate or, if consummated, successfully integrate the operations and management of any such acquisitions. Acquisitions involve significant risks, which could have a material adverse effect on us, including: Financial risks, such as (1) potential liabilities of the acquired businesses; (2) costs associated with integrating acquired operations and businesses; (3) the dilutive effect of the issuance of additional equity securities; (4) the incurrence of additional debt; (5) the financial impact of valuing goodwill and other intangible assets involved in any acquisitions, potential future impairment write downs of goodwill and the amortization of other intangible assets; (6) possible adverse tax and accounting effects; and (7) the risk that we spend substantial amounts purchasing these manufacturing facilities and assume significant contractual and other obligations with no guaranteed levels of revenue or that we may have to close facilities at our cost. Operating risks, such as (1) the diversion of managements attention to the assimilation of the businesses to be acquired; (2) the risk that the acquired businesses will fail to maintain the quality of services that we have historically provided; (3) the need to implement financial and other systems and add management resources; (4) the risk that key employees of the acquired businesses will leave after the acquisition; (5) unforeseen difficulties in the acquired operations; and (6) the impact on us of any unionized work force we may acquire or any labor disruptions that might occur. We have made a number of acquisitions that were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Our consolidated financial statements include the operating results of each business from the date of acquisition. See Factors Affecting Future Results We may not achieve expected profitability from our acquisitions. For further discussion of our acquisitions, see Note 12 Business Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During fiscal year 2003, we completed construction of and commenced operations in our new manufacturing facility in Huangpu, China. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. Management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances. We have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates 19 Table of Contents used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. For further discussion of our significant accounting policies, refer to Note 1 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts related to receivables not expected to be collected from our customers. This allowance is based on managements assessment of specific customer balances, considering the age of receivables and financial stability of the customer. If there is an adverse change in the financial condition of our customers, or if actual defaults are higher than provided for, an addition to the allowance may be necessary. Inventory Valuation We purchase inventory based on forecasted demand and record inventory at the lower of cost or market. Management regularly assesses inventory valuation based on current and forecasted usage and other lower of cost or market considerations. If actual market conditions or our customers product demands are less favorable than those projected, additional valuation adjustments may be necessary. Long Lived Assets We review property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of property, plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the projected cash flows the property, plant and equipment are expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the property exceeds its fair market value. The impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management, including revenue and cash flow projections. Circumstances that may lead to impairment of property, plant and equipment include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand and the restructuring of our operations as a result of a change in our business strategy. We have recorded intangible assets, including goodwill, principally based on third party valuations, in connection with material business acquisitions. Estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are determined by management based on an assessment of the period over which the asset is expected to contribute to future cash flows. The allocation of amortizable intangible assets impacts the amounts allocable to goodwill. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), which we early adopted effective September 1, 2001, we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests at least on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows. We completed the annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003 and determined that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test. The impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level, which we have determined to be consistent with our operating segments as defined in Note 9 Concentration of Risk and Segment Data to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The impairment analysis is based on assumptions of future results made by management, including revenue and cash flow projections at the reporting unit level. Circumstances that may lead to impairment of goodwill include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand, and the restructuring of our operations as a result of a change in our business strategy. Restructuring and Impairment Charges We recognized restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001 related to reductions in workforce, re sizing and closure of facilities and the transition of certain facilities into new customer development sites. These charges were recorded pursuant to formal plans developed and approved by management. The recognition of restructuring and impairment charges required that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature, timing and amount of costs associated with these 20 Table of Contents plans. The estimates of future liabilities may change, requiring additional restructuring and impairment charges or the reduction of liabilities already recorded. At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with the restructuring programs. For further discussion of our restructuring programs, refer to Note 13 Restructuring and Impairment Charges to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation Results of Operation Restructuring and Impairment Charges. Pension and Postretirement Benefits We have pension and postretirement benefit costs and liabilities, which are developed from actuarial valuations. Actuarial valuations require management to make certain judgments and estimates on discount rates and return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions on a regular basis taking into consideration current market conditions and historical market data. The discount rate is used to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date. This rate is required to represent the market rate for high quality fixed income investments. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. When considering the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets, we take into account current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on plan assets. Other assumptions include demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover. See Note 7 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes We estimate our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities. We must also make judgments regarding the ability to realize the deferred tax assets. The carrying value of our net deferred tax asset is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets that we do not believe meet the more likely than not criteria established by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Our judgments regarding future taxable income may change due to changes in market conditions, changes in tax laws or other factors. If our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future, the valuation allowances we have established may be increased or decreased, resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense. See Note 6 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 21 Table of Contents Results of Operation The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain operating data as a percentage of net revenue: Years Ended August 31, 2003 2002 2001 Net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenue 90.8 90.6 90.9 Gross profit 9.2 9.4 9.1 Selling, general and administrative 5.2 5.7 4.3 Research and development 0.2 0.2 0.2 Amortization of intangibles 0.8 0.4 0.1 Acquisition related charges 0.3 0.2 0.2 Restructuring and impairment charges 1.8 1.5 0.6 Operating income 0.9 1.4 3.7 Other income (0.1 ) Interest income (0.1 ) (0.3 ) (0.2 ) Interest expense 0.3 0.4 0.1 Income before income taxes 0.8 1.3 3.8 Income tax (benefit) expense (0.1 ) 0.3 1.1 Net income 0.9 % 1.0 % 2.7 % Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2003 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2002 Net Revenue. Our net revenue increased 33.4% to $4.7 billion for fiscal year 2003, up from $3.5 billion in fiscal year 2002. The increase was primarily due to a 218% increase in production of consumer products, an 80% increase in production of instrumentation and medical products, a 72% increase in production of automotive products, a 54% increase in production of computing and storage products and a 4% increase in production of networking products due to the addition of new customers, acquisitions and organic growth in those sectors. The increase in the consumer products sector was primarily due to the acquisition of certain operations of Philips during fiscal year 2003. These increases were offset in part by an 18% decrease in production of telecommunications products due to reduced demand in this sector. Foreign source revenue represented 80.7% of our net revenue for fiscal year 2003 and 60.6% of net revenue for fiscal year 2002. The increase in foreign source revenue was primarily attributable to incremental revenue resulting from our acquisitions in France and Scotland during late fiscal year 2002, and our acquisitions in Austria, Brazil, Belgium, China, Hungary, India, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland and Singapore during fiscal year 2003. We currently anticipate that our foreign source revenue will continue to increase as a percentage of our total net revenue. Gross Profit. Gross profit decreased slightly to 9.2% in fiscal year 2003 from 9.4% in fiscal year 2002 primarily due to a decrease in the portion of manufacturing based revenue and the mix of value add based revenue from our acquisitions, partially offset by cost reductions realized from our restructuring activities. Selling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $243.7 million (5.2% of net revenue) in fiscal year 2003 from $203.8 million (5.7% of net revenue) in fiscal year 2002. The increase in dollar amount was primarily attributable to operations acquired in late fiscal year 2002 and fiscal year 2003 and to operations in facilities for which construction was completed during fiscal year 2003. The decrease as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to the increased revenue base in fiscal year 2003. R&D. R&D expenses in fiscal year 2003 increased to $9.9 million from $7.9 million in fiscal year 2002 but remained at 0.2% of net revenue for each of the fiscal years ended August 31, 2003 and 2002. 22 Table of Contents Despite the recent economic conditions, we continued to engage in R&D activities, including design of circuit board assemblies and the related production process, development of new products and new failure analysis techniques at our historical levels. Amortization of Intangibles. We recorded $36.9 million of amortization of intangibles in fiscal year 2003 as compared to $15.1 million in fiscal year 2002. The increase was attributable to acquired amortizable intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions in late fiscal year 2002 and fiscal year 2003. For additional information regarding purchased intangibles, see Acquisitions and Expansion above, Note 1(f) Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Note 4 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Note 12 Business Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Acquisition related Charges. During fiscal year 2003, we incurred $15.3 million in acquisition related charges in connection with the acquisitions of certain operations of Quantum, Alcatel, Valeo, Lucent, Seagate, Philips and NEC Corporation (NEC). See Note 12 Business Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Restructuring and Impairment Charges. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2003, we initiated a restructuring program to reduce our cost structure and further align our manufacturing capacity with customer geographic requirements. This restructuring program resulted in restructuring and impairment charges of $85.3 million for fiscal year 2003. These restructuring and impairment charges included cash costs totaling $47.7 million consisting of employee severance and benefits costs of approximately $29.9 million, costs related to lease commitments of approximately $14.9 million and other restructuring costs of $2.9 million. Non cash costs of approximately $37.6 million represent fixed asset impairment charges related to our restructuring activities. As of August 31, 2003, liabilities of $12.9 million related to these restructuring activities are expected to be paid out within the next twelve months and liabilities of $8.8 million are expected to be paid out through August 31, 2006. The employee severance and benefit costs included in our restructuring and impairment costs recorded in fiscal year 2003 are related to the elimination of approximately 2,300 employees, the majority of which were engaged in direct and indirect manufacturing activities in manufacturing facilities in the United States and Europe. Lease commitment costs consisted primarily of future lease payments for facilities vacated because of the closure and consolidation of facilities in the United States. The fixed asset impairment charge resulted from the closure of our Boise, Idaho and Coventry, England facilities, as well as a realignment of our worldwide capacity due to the restructuring activities carried out during fiscal year 2003. The production from the Boise location was transferred to other existing locations during fiscal year 2003. The transfer of production from the Coventry location began during the second quarter of fiscal year 2003 and was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003. For additional information regarding restructuring costs, see Note 13 Restructuring and Impairment Charges to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result of the restructuring activities completed through May 31, 2003, we realized a cumulative cost savings of approximately $4.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003. The restructuring activities completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003 are expected to contribute an additional $2.0 million to our cumulative quarterly cost savings. Therefore, we expect to realize cost savings of approximately $6.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2004 and each quarter thereafter. The cumulative quarterly cost savings consists of $4.8 million reduction in cost of revenue due to a reduction in employee payroll and benefit expense of $2.9 million and $1.9 million in depreciation expense, and $1.2 million reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses. Interest Income. Interest income decreased to $6.9 million in fiscal year 2003 from $9.8 million in fiscal year 2002 reflecting lower interest yields on cash deposits and short term investments. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $17.0 million in fiscal year 2003, from $13.1 million in fiscal year 2002, primarily as a result of borrowings under our revolving credit facilities during the year, imputed interest related to the Philips acquisitions and the issuance of the $300.0 million, seven year, 23 Table of Contents 5.875% senior notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003. See Note 5 Notes Payable, Long Term Debt and Long Term Lease Obligations to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes. We recognized an effective income tax benefit of 16.4% in fiscal year 2003, as compared to an effective income tax rate of 22.4% in fiscal year 2002. The tax rate is a function of the mix of the effective tax rates in the tax jurisdictions in which our restructuring charges were incurred, and the mix of domestic versus international income from operations. The amount of restructuring charges recorded during fiscal year 2003, and the fact that the income taxes associated with the restructuring charges were calculated using the effective tax rates in the jurisdictions in which those charges were incurred, resulted in an income tax benefit. In addition, as the proportion of our income derived from foreign sources has increased, our effective tax rate has decreased as our international operations have historically been taxed at a lower rate than in the United States, primarily due to tax holidays granted to our sites in Malaysia, China and Hungary that expire at various dates through 2010. Such tax holidays are subject to conditions with which we expect to continue to comply. See Note 6 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2002 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2001 Net Revenue. Our net revenue decreased 18.1% to $3.5 billion for fiscal year 2002, down from $4.3 billion in fiscal year 2001. The decrease was primarily due to a 49.3% decrease in production of computing and storage products, a 37.5% decrease in production of peripheral products and a 13.7% decrease in production of networking products due to softening demand in those sectors. These decreases were offset in part by 58.1% and 27.5% increases in production of instrumentation and medical and consumer products, respectively, due to the addition of new customers and organic growth in those sectors. Foreign source revenue represented 60.6% of our net revenue for fiscal year 2002 and 50.3% of revenue for fiscal year 2001. The increase in foreign source revenue was primarily attributable to incremental revenue resulting from our acquisitions in England, France, Italy, Malaysia and Scotland. The percentage of foreign source revenue also increased as a result of the current economic conditions in the U.S. As our overall revenue has fallen, our U.S. based revenues have decreased proportionally more than the decreases in the Asian, Latin American and European markets. Gross Profit. Gross profit increased to 9.4% in fiscal year 2002 from 9.1% in fiscal year 2001 primarily due to an increase in the portion of manufacturing based revenue and due to cost reductions realized from our restructuring activities during fiscal years 2002 and 2001. Selling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $203.8 million (5.7% of net revenue) in fiscal year 2002 from $184.1 million (4.3% of net revenue) in fiscal year 2001. The increase in dollar amount was primarily attributable to locations acquired in late fiscal year 2001 and fiscal year 2002 and to a full years operations in facilities that were under construction or starting production during fiscal year 2001. The increase as a percentage of net revenue was impacted by the increase in absolute dollars as well as by decreased revenues in fiscal year 2002. R&D. R&D expenses in fiscal year 2002 increased to $7.9 million from $6.4 million in fiscal year 2001 but remained at 0.2% of net revenue for each of the fiscal years ended August 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Despite the adverse economic conditions during fiscal year 2002 that negatively impacted the demand for our services, we continued to engage in R&D activities, including design of circuit board assemblies and the related production process, development of new products and new failure analysis techniques at our historical levels. Amortization of Intangibles. We recorded $15.1 million of amortization of intangibles in fiscal year 2002 as compared to $5.8 million in fiscal year 2001. This increase was attributable to acquired amortizable intangible assets arising from our acquisitions in England and Italy during late fiscal year 2001 and in France, Malaysia, Scotland and the United States during fiscal year 2002. We elected to early adopt SFAS 142, effective the beginning of fiscal year 2002. In accordance with SFAS 142, we ceased amortizing goodwill for fiscal year 2002. For additional information regarding 24 Table of Contents purchased intangibles, see Acquisitions and Expansion above, Note 1(f) Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Note 4 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Note 12 Business Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Acquisition related Charges. During fiscal year 2002, we incurred $7.6 million in acquisition related charges consisting of increased incremental staffing and support costs and legal and professional fees associated with the acquisitions in France, Malaysia, Scotland and the United States. See Note 12 Business Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Restructuring and Impairment Charges. During fiscal year 2002, we incurred $52.1 million in restructuring charges related to reductions in our cost structure. These charges included reductions in workforce, re sizing of facilities and the transition of certain facilities into new customer development sites. These charges were largely intended to align our capacity and infrastructure to anticipated customer demand. Approximately $7.2 million related to asset write off costs, $10.6 million to lease exit costs, $32.1 million to employee severance and termination benefit costs and $2.2 million in other restructuring costs. The employee severance and benefit termination costs included in our restructuring charges were related to the elimination of approximately 2,800 employees during fiscal year 2002. The majority of these employees were engaged in direct and indirect manufacturing activities in various facilities around the world. Costs related to lease commitments consisted primarily of future lease payments for facilities vacated as a result of the consolidation of facilities. The fixed asset impairment charge primarily resulted from a decision made to vacate several smaller facilities in the United States, Europe and Asia due to adverse macroeconomic conditions. For additional information regarding restructuring costs, see Note 13 Restructuring and Impairment Charges to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest Income. Interest income increased to $9.8 million in fiscal year 2002 from $8.2 million in fiscal year 2001 reflecting increased income on greater cash balances resulting from positive cash flow from operations during fiscal year 2002 and the proceeds from our issuance of convertible notes completed in the third quarter of fiscal year 2001. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $13.1 million in fiscal year 2002, from $5.9 million in fiscal year 2001, primarily as a result of our issuance of convertible notes near the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2001 and imputed interest on deferred acquisition payments related to the Marconi acquisition. Income Taxes. In fiscal year 2002, our effective tax rate decreased to 22.4% from 28.7% in fiscal year 2001. The tax rate is predominantly a function of the mix of domestic versus international income from operations. As the proportion of our income derived from foreign sources has increased, our effective tax rate has decreased as our international operations have historically been taxed at a lower rate than in the United States, primarily due to tax holidays granted to our sites in Malaysia, China and Hungary that expire through 2010. Such tax holidays are subject to conditions with which we expect to continue to comply. In addition to the increase in foreign source income, the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2002, as compared to fiscal year 2001 decreased due to the mix of the effective tax rates in the tax jurisdictions in which our restructuring and acquisition related charges were incurred and the tax treatment of the amortization of intangibles in each jurisdiction. See Note 6 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Quarterly Results (Unaudited) The following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly financial information for the 2003 and 2002 fiscal years. In the opinion of management, this information has been presented on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere, and all necessary adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the unaudited quarterly results when read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto. The operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period. 25 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2003 Fiscal Year 2002 Aug. 31, May 31, Feb. 28, Nov. 30, Aug. 31, May 31, Feb. 28, Nov. 30, 2003 2003 2003 2002 2002 2002 2002 2001 (in thousands, except per share data) Net revenue $ 1,296,015 $ 1,219,304 $ 1,145,917 $ 1,068,246 $ 988,223 $ 850,602 $ 822,074 $ 884,567 Cost of revenue 1,175,611 1,106,673 1,041,030 970,702 892,597 766,737 748,582 802,959 Gross profit 120,404 112,631 104,887 97,544 95,626 83,865 73,492 81,608 Selling, general and administrative 65,051 62,462 60,310 55,840 55,106 49,404 49,732 49,603 Research and development 2,506 2,353 2,431 2,616 2,053 2,074 1,859 1,878 Amortization of intangibles 12,514 8,489 9,716 6,151 4,624 3,467 4,180 2,842 Acquisition related charges 3,934 3,920 3,697 3,715 3,951 1,068 546 2,011 Restructuring and impairment charges 8,958 32,863 17,128 26,359 27,555 10,446 14,142 Operating income 27,441 2,544 11,605 2,863 2,337 27,852 6,729 11,132 Other income (2,600 ) Interest income (1,684 ) (1,465 ) (1,847 ) (1,924 ) (2,509 ) (3,073 ) (2,008 ) (2,171 ) Interest expense 5,246 3,862 4,182 3,729 3,041 3,766 3,465 2,783 Income before income taxes 23,879 147 9,270 3,658 1,805 27,159 5,272 10,520 Income tax expense (benefit) 3,807 (4,319 ) (842 ) (4,699 ) (27 ) 6,353 1,570 2,145 Net income $ 20,072 $ 4,466 $ 10,112 $ 8,357 $ 1,832 $ 20,806 $ 3,702 $ 8,375 Earnings per share: Basic $ 0.10 $ 0.02 $ 0.05 $ 0.04 $ 0.01 $ 0.11 $ 0.02 $ 0.04 Diluted $ 0.10 $ 0.02 $ 0.05 $ 0.04 $ 0.01 $ 0.10 $ 0.02 $ 0.04 Common shares used in the calculations of earnings per share: Basic 199,059 198,596 198,351 197,972 197,787 197,481 197,305 197,012 Diluted 203,980 202,132 200,726 200,099 200,643 200,997 201,348 199,515 The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain financial information stated as a percentage of net revenue: Fiscal Year 2003 Fiscal Year 2002 Aug. 31, May 31, Feb. 28, Nov. 30, Aug. 31, May 31, Feb. 28, Nov. 30, 2003 2003 2003 2002 2002 2002 2002 2001 Net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenue 90.7 90.8 90.8 90.9 90.3 90.2 91.1 90.8 Gross profit 9.3 9.2 9.2 9.1 9.7 9.8 8.9 9.2 Selling, general and administrative 5.0 5.1 5.3 5.2 5.6 5.8 6.0 5.6 Research and development 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.3 0.2 0.2 Amortization of intangibles 1.0 0.7 0.9 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.5 0.3 Acquisition related charges 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.4 0.1 0.1 0.2 Restructuring and impairment charges 0.7 2.7 1.5 2.5 2.8 1.3 1.6 Operating income 2.1 0.2 1.0 0.3 0.2 3.2 0.8 1.3 Other income (0.2 ) Interest income (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.2 ) (0.2 ) (0.3 ) (0.4 ) (0.2 ) (0.2 ) Interest expense 0.4 0.3 0.4 0.3 0.3 0.4 0.4 0.3 Income before income taxes 1.8 0.0 0.8 0.4 0.2 3.2 0.6 1.2 Income tax expense (benefit) 0.3 (0.4 ) (0.1 ) (0.4 ) 0.0 0.8 0.2 0.3 Net income 1.5 % 0.4 % 0.9 % 0.8 % 0.2 % 2.4 % 0.4 % 0.9 % 26 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources At August 31, 2003, we had cash and cash equivalent balances totaling $699.7 million, total notes payable, long term debt and capital lease obligations of $644.3 million and $405.1 million available for borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2003 was $263.5 million. This consisted primarily of $43.0 million of net income, $224.4 million of depreciation and amortization, $68.6 million from decreases of inventory, $194.7 million from increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and $56.4 million of non cash restructuring charges, offset by increases in accounts receivable of $286.6 million and increases in deferred income taxes of $29.0 million. Net cash used in investing activities of $517.5 million for fiscal year 2003 consisted of our capital expenditures of $117.2 million for construction and equipment worldwide and cash paid of $415.2 million in the acquisition of businesses, net of $14.9 million of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment. Net cash provided by financing activities of $312.4 million for fiscal year 2003 resulted primarily from net proceeds of $297.2 million from the issuance of $300 million Senior Notes described below and $17.1 million net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under option and employee purchase plans. See Note 5 Notes Payable, Long Term Debt and Long Term Lease Obligations and Note 8 Stockholders Equity to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We may need to finance future growth and any corresponding working capital needs with additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility described below, as well as additional public and private offerings of our debt and equity. During the first quarter of fiscal year 1999, we filed a $750 million shelf registration statement with the SEC registering the potential sale of debt and equity securities in the future, from time to time, to augment our liquidity and capital resources. In June 2000, we sold 13.0 million shares of our common stock pursuant to our shelf registration statement, which generated net proceeds of $525.4 million. In August 2000, we increased the amount of securities available to be issued under a shelf registration statement to $1.5 billion. In May 2001, we issued a total of $345.0 million, 20 year, 1.75% convertible subordinated notes (the Convertible Notes) at par, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $337.5 million. The Convertible Notes mature on May 15, 2021 and pay interest semiannually on May 15 and November 15. Each Convertible Note is convertible at any time after the date of original issuance and prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date by the holder at a conversion rate of 24.368 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes. Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their Convertible Notes on May 15 in the years 2004, 2006, 2009 and 2014 at par plus accrued interest. Accordingly, the Convertible Notes are classified as current debt as of August 31, 2003. If holders require us to purchase Convertible Notes from them, we may choose to pay the purchase price in cash or common stock valued at 95% of its then market price. We may redeem all or a portion of the Convertible Notes for cash at any time on or after May 18, 2004 at 100% of principal plus accrued interest. In July 2003, we issued a total of $300.0 million, seven year, 5.875% senior notes (5.875% Senior Notes) at 99.803% of par, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $297.2 million. The 5.875% Senior Notes mature on July 15, 2010 and pay interest semiannually on January 15 and July 15, commencing January 15, 2004. Both the Convertible Notes and 5.875% Senior Notes were offered pursuant to our shelf registration statement. Approximately $855 million of securities remain registered with the SEC under such registration statement. In July 2003, we entered into an interest rate swap transaction to effectively convert the fixed interest rate of our 5.875% Senior Notes to a variable rate. The swap, which expires in 2010, is accounted for as a fair value hedge under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities (SFAS 133). The notional amount of the swap is $300.0 million, which is related to the 5.875% Senior Notes. Under the terms of the swap, we will pay an interest rate equal to the six month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) rate, set in arrears, plus a fixed spread of 1.945%. In exchange, we will receive a fixed rate of 5.875%. At August 31, 2003, $17 million has been recorded in other long term liabilities to record the fair value of the interest rate 27 Table of Contents swap, with a corresponding decrease to the carrying value of the 5.875% Senior Notes on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At August 31, 2003, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash, cash equivalents and available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. On November 29, 2002, we renegotiated our then existing line of credit facility and established a three year, $295.0 million credit facility (the Revolver). A 65% equity interest in a foreign subsidiary was pledged to secure repayment of the Revolver. Under the terms of the Revolver, borrowings could be made under either floating rate loans or Eurodollar rate loans. Interest accrued on outstanding floating rate loans at the greater of the agents prime rate or 0.50% plus federal funds rate. Interest accrued on outstanding Eurodollar loans at the LIBOR in effect at the loan inception plus a spread of 0.65% to 1.35%. A facility fee based on the commitment amount of the Revolver was payable quarterly at a rate equal to 0.225% to 0.40%. If our borrowings on the Revolver exceeded 33 1/3% of the aggregate commitment, a usage fee would be due. The usage fee rate ranged from 0.125% to 0.25%. The interest spread, facility fee and usage fee were determined based on our general corporate rating as determined by Standard & Poors Rating Service (S&P) and Moodys Investor Service (Moodys). The Revolver had an expiration date of November 29, 2005 when outstanding borrowings would then be due and payable. On July 14, 2003, we amended and revised the Revolver and established a three year, $400.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks (the Amended Revolver). The pledge of the 65% of the equity interest in the foreign subsidiary was released. Under the terms of the Amended Revolver, borrowings can be made under either floating rate loans or Eurodollar rate loans. We pay interest on outstanding floating rate loans at the greater of the agents prime rate or 0.50% plus the federal funds rate. We pay interest on outstanding Eurodollar loans at the LIBOR in effect at the loan inception plus a spread of 0.65% to 1.35%. We pay a facility fee based on the committed amount of the Amended Revolver at a rate equal to 0.225% to 0.40%. We also pay a usage fee if our borrowings on the Amended Revolver exceed 33 1/3% of the aggregate commitment. The usage fee rate ranges from 0.125% to 0.25%. The interest spread, facility fee and usage fee are determined based on our general corporate rating or rating of our senior unsecured long term indebtedness as determined by S&P and Moodys. As of August 31, 2003, the interest spread on the Amended Revolver was 1.325%. The Amended Revolver expires on July 14, 2006 and outstanding borrowings are then due and payable. The Amended Revolver requires compliance with several financial covenants including a fixed charge coverage ratio, consolidated net worth threshold and indebtedness to EBITDA ratio, as defined in the Amended Revolver. The Amended Revolver requires compliance with certain operating covenants, which limit, among other things, our incurrence of additional indebtedness. We were in compliance with the respective covenants as of August 31, 2003. As of August 31, 2003, there were no borrowings outstanding on the Amended Revolver. On November 29, 2002, we negotiated a 364 day, $305.0 million line of credit facility with a syndicate of banks. A 65% equity interest in a foreign subsidiary was pledged to secure repayment of the facility. The terms of the line of credit agreement mirrored the terms of the Revolver described above. The 364 day facility was to expire on November 29, 2003. At the time we entered into the Amended Revolver on July 14, 2003, we terminated this line of credit facility. On May 28, 2003, we negotiated a six month, 1.8 billion Japanese Yen (JPY) (approximately $15.2 million based on currency exchange rates at the time) credit facility for a Japanese subsidiary with a Japanese bank. Under the terms of the credit facility, interest accrued on outstanding borrowings based on the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (TIBOR) plus a spread of 1.75%. The credit facility was to expire on December 2, 2003 and any outstanding borrowings would then be due and payable. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003, we borrowed 1.8 billion JPY on this facility. The cash proceeds, which translated to $15.2 million based on foreign currency rates in effect at the date of the borrowing, were used to partially fund the acquisition of certain operations of NEC in Gotemba, Japan. On August 28, 2003, we renegotiated the 1.8 billion JPY credit facility by converting it into a five year term loan (Japan Term Loan), with the final principal payment due May 31, 2008. We pay interest on the Japan Term Loan quarterly at a fixed annual rate of 2.97%. The Japan Term Loan requires quarterly repayments of principal 28 Table of Contents of 105 million JPY beginning May 31, 2004. The Japan Term Loan requires compliance with financial and operating covenants including maintaining a minimum equity balance at the respective subsidiary level. We were in compliance with the respective covenants as of August 31, 2003. On May 28, 2003, we negotiated a six month, 0.6 billion JPY (approximately $5.1 million based on currency exchange rates at the time) credit facility for a Japanese subsidiary with a Japanese bank. Under the terms of the facility, we pay interest on outstanding borrowings based on TIBOR plus a spread of 1.75%. The credit facility expires on December 2, 2003 and any outstanding borrowings are then due and payable. We plan to renew this facility in the first quarter of fiscal year 2004. As of August 31, 2003, there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility. On June 23, 2003, we paid the remaining $8.3 million outstanding balance of the $50.0 million, 6.89% Senior Notes we originally issued in May 1996 that were scheduled to mature in May 2004. During fiscal year 2002 and early fiscal year 2003, we had an accounts receivable securitization program that provided for the sale of up to $100.0 million of eligible accounts receivables of certain U.S. plants. We allowed the program to expire in May 2003. Our working capital requirements and capital expenditures could continue to increase in order to support future expansions of our operations through greenfield growth or acquisitions. It is possible that future expansions may be significant and may require the payment of cash. Future liquidity needs will also depend on fluctuations in levels of inventory and shipments, changes in customer order volumes and timing of expenditures for new equipment. We currently believe that during the next twelve months, our capital expenditures will be approximately $80 million, principally for machinery, equipment, facilities and related expenses. We believe that our level of resources, which include cash on hand, available borrowings under our Amended Revolver, and funds provided by operations, will be adequate to fund these capital expenditures and our working capital requirements for the next twelve months. Should we desire to consummate significant additional acquisition opportunities, our capital needs would increase and could possibly result in our need to increase available borrowings under our Amended Revolver or access public or private debt and equity markets. There can be no assurance, however, that we would be successful in raising additional debt or equity on terms that we would consider acceptable. Our contractual obligations for short and long term debt arrangements, future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating lease arrangements and other long term obligations as of August 31, 2003 are summarized below. We do not participate in, or secure financing for any unconsolidated limited purpose entities. Non cancelable purchase commitments do not typically extend beyond the normal lead time of several weeks at most. Purchase orders beyond this time frame are typically cancelable.

Our annual and quarterly operating results are affected by a number of factors, including: adverse changes in general economic conditions; the level and timing of customer orders; the level of capacity utilization of our manufacturing facilities and associated fixed costs; the composition of the costs of revenue between materials, labor and manufacturing overhead; price competition; our level of experience in manufacturing a particular product; the degree of automation used in our assembly process; the efficiencies achieved in managing inventories and fixed assets; fluctuations in materials costs and availability of materials; and the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales, customer product delivery requirements and shortages of components or labor. The volume and timing of orders placed by our customers vary due to variation in demand for our customers products; our customers attempts to manage their inventory; electronic design changes; changes in our customers manufacturing strategies; and acquisitions of or consolidations among our customers. In the past, changes in customer orders have had a significant effect on our results of operations due to corresponding changes in the level of our overhead absorption. Any one or a combination of these factors could adversely affect our annual and quarterly results of operations in the future. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation Quarterly Results. Because we depend on a limited number of customers, a reduction in sales to any one of our customers could cause a significant decline in our revenue. For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2003, our five largest customers accounted for approximately 53% of our net revenue and 32 customers accounted for over 95% of our net revenue. For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2003, Cisco, Philips and HP accounted for approximately 16%, 15% and 11% of our net revenue, respectively. We expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue and upon their growth, viability and financial stability. Our customers industries have experienced rapid technological change, shortening of product life cycles, consolidation, and pricing and margin pressures. Consolidation among our customers may further reduce the number of customers that generate a significant percentage of our revenues and exposes us to increased risks relating to dependence on a small number of customers. A significant reduction in sales to any of our customers or a customer exerting significant pricing and margin pressures on us, would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In the past, some of our customers have terminated their manufacturing arrangements with us or have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of manufacturing services ordered from us. The industrys revenue declined in mid 2001 as a result of significant cut backs in its customers production requirements, which was consistent with the overall global economic downturn. We cannot assure you that present or future customers will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us or significantly change, reduce or delay the amount of manufacturing services ordered from us. If they do, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, we generate significant account receivables in connection with providing manufacturing services to our customers. If one or more of our customers were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay for the manufacturing services provided by us, our operating results and financial condition would be 30 Table of Contents adversely affected. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation and Business Customers and Marketing. Our customers may be adversely affected by rapid technological change. Our customers compete in markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and continuous improvements in products and services. These conditions frequently result in short product life cycles. Our success will depend largely on the success achieved by our customers in developing and marketing their products. If technologies or standards supported by our customers products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance, our business could be materially adversely affected. We depend on industries that utilize electronics components, which includes the telecommunications industry, which continually produces technologically advanced products with short life cycles; our inability to continually manufacture such products on a cost effective basis would harm our business. Factors affecting the industries that utilize electronics components in general could seriously harm our customers and, as a result, us. These factors include: the inability of our customers to adapt to rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards, which result in short product life cycles; the inability of our customers to develop and market their products, some of which are new and untested, the potential that our customers products may become obsolete or the failure of our customers products to gain widespread commercial acceptance; and recessionary periods in our customers markets. If any of these factors materialize, our business would suffer. In addition, if we are unable to offer technologically advanced, cost effective, quick response manufacturing service to customers, demand for our services will also decline. A substantial portion of our net revenue is derived from our offering of complete service solutions for our customers. For example, if we fail to maintain high quality design and engineering services, our net revenue may significantly decline. Most of our customers do not commit to long term production schedules, which makes it difficult for us to schedule production and achieve maximum efficiency of our manufacturing capacity. The volume and timing of sales to our customers may vary due to: variation in demand for our customers products; our customers attempts to manage their inventory; electronic design changes; changes in our customers manufacturing strategy; and acquisitions of or consolidations among customers. Due in part to these factors, most of our customers do not commit to firm production schedules for more than one quarter in advance. Our inability to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity. In the past, we have been required to increase staffing and other expenses in order to meet the anticipated demand of our customers. Anticipated orders from many of our customers have, in the past, failed to materialize or delivery schedules have been deferred as a result of changes in our customers business needs, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations. On other occasions, our customers have required rapid increases in production, which have placed an excessive burden on our resources. Such customer order fluctuations and deferrals have had a material adverse effect on us in the past, and we may experience such effects in the future. In addition, the current business environment resulting from uncertainties 31 Table of Contents relating to economic recession has made planning even more complex. A business downturn resulting from any of these external factors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation and Business Backlog. Our customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or delay production. EMS providers must provide increasingly rapid product turnaround for their customers. We generally do not obtain firm, long term purchase commitments from our customers and we continue to experience reduced lead times in customer orders. Customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or delay production for a number of reasons. The success of our customers products in the market affects our business. Cancellations, reductions or delay by a significant customer or by a group of customers could negatively impact our operating results. In addition, we make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, personnel needs and other resource requirements, based on our estimate of customer requirements. The short term nature of our customers commitments and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products reduces our ability to accurately estimate the future requirements of those customers. On occasion, customers may require rapid increases in production, which can stress our resources and reduce operating margins. In addition, because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand can harm our gross profits and operating results. We compete with numerous EMS providers and others, including our current and potential customers who may decide to manufacture all of their products internally. The EMS business is highly competitive. We compete against numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers, including Celestica, Inc., Flextronics International, Sanmina SCI Corporation and Solectron Corporation. In addition, we may in the future encounter competition from other large electronic manufacturers that are selling, or may begin to sell, EMS. Most of our competitors have international operations, significant financial resources and some have substantially greater manufacturing, R&D, and marketing resources than us. These competitors may: respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies; have greater name recognition, critical mass and geographic market presence; be better able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities; adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements; devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their services; and be better positioned to compete on price for their services. We also face competition from the manufacturing operations of our current and potential customers, who are continually evaluating the merits of manufacturing products internally against the advantages of outsourcing to EMS providers. In addition, in recent years, ODMs, companies that provide design and manufacturing services to OEMs, have significantly increased their share of outsourced manufacturing services provided to OEMs in several markets, such as notebook and desktop computers, personal computer motherboards, and consumer electronic products. Competition from ODMs, such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., may increase if our business in these markets grows or if ODMs expand further into or beyond these markets. See Business Competition. Increased competition may result in decreased demand or prices for our services. The EMS industry is highly competitive. We compete against numerous U.S. and foreign EMS providers with global operations, as well as those who operate on a local or regional basis. In addition, 32 Table of Contents current and prospective customers continually evaluate the merits of manufacturing products internally. Some of our competitors have substantially greater managerial, manufacturing, engineering, technical, systems, R&D, sales and marketing resources than we do. Consolidation in the EMS industry results in larger and more geographically diverse competitors who have significant combined resources with which to compete against us. We may be operating at a cost disadvantage compared to competitors who have greater direct buying power from component suppliers, distributors and raw material suppliers or who have lower cost structures as a result of their geographic location or the services they provide. As a result, competitors may procure a competitive advantage and obtain business from our customers. Our manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant proprietary protection, and companies with greater resources or a greater market presence may enter our market or increase their competition with us. We also expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products or services, to reduce their current products or service sales prices and to introduce new products or services that may offer greater performance and improved pricing. Any of these could cause a decline in sales, loss of market acceptance of our products or services, profit margin compression, or loss of market share. We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our international operations, which may be subject to a number of risks and often require more management time and expense to achieve profitability than our domestic operations. We derived 80.7% of revenues from international operations in fiscal year 2003 compared to 60.6% in fiscal year 2002. We expect our revenues from international operations to continue to increase. We currently operate outside the United States in Vienna, Austria; Bruges, Brussels and Hasselt, Belgium; Belo Horizonte, Manaus and Sao Paulo, Brazil; Huangpu, Panyu, Shanghai and Shenzhen, China; Coventry, England; Brest and Meung sur Loire, France; Szombathely and Tiszaujvaros, Hungary; Pimpri, India; Dublin, Ireland; Bergamo and Marcianise, Italy; Gotemba, Japan; Penang, Malaysia; Chihuahua, Guadalajara and Reynosa, Mexico; Kwidzyn, Poland; Ayr and Livingston, Scotland; and Singapore City, Singapore. We continually consider additional opportunities to make foreign acquisitions and construct new foreign facilities. Our international operations may be subject to a number of risks, including: difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; political and economic instability; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and laws; longer customer payment cycles and difficulty collecting accounts receivable export duties, import controls and trade barriers (including quotas); governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to us from our operations outside the United States; burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and labor practices; fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could affect local payroll, utility and other expenses; and inability to utilize net operating losses incurred by our foreign operations against future income in the same jurisdiction. In addition, several of the countries where we operate have emerging or developing economies, which may be subject to greater currency volatility, negative growth, high inflation, limited availability of foreign exchange and other risks. These factors may harm our results of operations, and any measures that we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies and other risks of our international operations may not be effective. In our experience, entry into new international markets requires considerable management time as well as start up expenses for market development, hiring and establishing office facilities before any significant revenues are generated. As a result, initial operations in a new market may 33 Table of Contents operate at low margins or may be unprofitable. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation Liquidity and Capital Resources. If we do not manage our growth effectively, our profitability could decline. We have grown rapidly. Our ability to manage growth effectively will require us to continue to implement and improve our operational, financial and management information systems; continue to develop the management skills of our managers and supervisors; and continue to train, motivate and manage our employees. Our failure to effectively manage growth could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See Selected Consolidated Financial Data and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. We may not achieve expected profitability from our acquisitions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate the operations and management of our recent acquisitions. Similarly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate or, if consummated, successfully integrate the operations and management of future acquisitions. Acquisitions involve significant risks, which could have a material adverse effect on us, including: Financial risks, such as (1) potential liabilities of the acquired businesses; (2) costs associated with integrating acquired operations and businesses; (3) the dilutive effect of the issuance of additional equity securities; (4) the incurrence of additional debt; (5) the financial impact of valuing goodwill and other intangible assets involved in any acquisitions, potential future impairment write downs of goodwill and the amortization of other intangible assets; (6) possible adverse tax and accounting effects; and (7) the risk that we spend substantial amounts purchasing these manufacturing facilities and assume significant contractual and other obligations with no guaranteed levels of revenue or that we may have to close facilities at our cost. Operating risks, such as (1) the diversion of managements attention to the assimilation of the businesses to be acquired; (2) the risk that the acquired businesses will fail to maintain the quality of services that we have historically provided; (3) the need to implement financial and other systems and add management resources; (4) the risk that key employees of the acquired businesses will leave after the acquisition; (5) unforeseen difficulties in the acquired operations; and (6) the impact on us of any unionized work force we may acquire or any labor disruptions that might occur. We have acquired and will continue to pursue the acquisition of manufacturing and supply chain management operations from OEMs. In these acquisitions, the divesting OEM will typically enter a supply arrangement with the acquiror. Therefore, the competition for these acquisitions is intense. In addition, certain OEMs may not choose to consummate these acquisitions with us because of our current supply arrangements with other OEMs. If we are unable to attract and consummate some of these acquisition opportunities, our growth could be adversely impacted. Arrangements entered into with divesting OEMs typically involve many risks, including the following: the integration into our business of the acquired assets and facilities may be time consuming and costly; we, rather than the divesting OEM, may bear the risk of excess capacity; we may not achieve anticipated cost reductions and efficiencies; we may be unable to meet the expectations of the OEM as to volume, product quality, timeliness and cost reductions; and if demand for the OEMs products declines, the OEM may reduce its volume of purchases, and we may not be able to sufficiently reduce the expenses of operating the facility or use the facility to provide services to other OEMs. 34 Table of Contents As a result of these and other risks, we may be unable to achieve anticipated levels of profitability under these arrangements, and they may not result in any material revenues or contribute positively to our earnings. Our ability to achieve the expected benefits of the outsourcing opportunities associated with these acquisitions is subject to risks, including our ability to meet volume, product quality, timeliness and pricing requirements, and our ability to achieve the OEMs expected cost reduction. In addition, when acquiring manufacturing operations, we may receive limited commitments to firm production schedules. Accordingly, in these circumstances, we may spend substantial amounts purchasing these manufacturing facilities and assume significant contractual and other obligations with no guaranteed levels of revenues. We may also not achieve expected profitability from these arrangements. As a result of these and other risks, these outsourcing opportunities may not be profitable. We face risks arising from the restructuring of our operations. Over the past few years, we have undertaken initiatives to restructure our business operations with the intention of improving utilization and realizing cost savings in the future. These initiatives have included changing the number and location of our production facilities, largely to align our capacity and infrastructure with current and anticipated customer demand. This alignment includes transferring programs from higher cost geographies to lower cost geographies. The process of restructuring entails, among other activities, moving production between facilities, reducing staff levels, realigning our business processes and reorganizing our management. We continue to evaluate our operations and may need to undertake additional restructuring initiatives in the future. If we incur additional restructuring related charges, our financial condition and results of operations may suffer. We depend on a limited number of suppliers for components that are critical to our manufacturing processes. A shortage of these components or an increase in their price could interrupt our operations and reduce our profits. Substantially all of our net revenue is derived from turnkey manufacturing in which we provide materials procurement. While most of our significant long term customer contracts permit quarterly or other periodic adjustments to pricing based on decreases and increases in component prices and other factors, we may bear the risk of component price increases that occur between any such re pricings or, if such re pricing is not permitted, during the balance of the term of the particular customer contract. Accordingly, certain component price increases could adversely affect our gross profit margins. Almost all of the products we manufacture require one or more components that are available from only a single source. Some of these components are allocated from time to time in response to supply shortages. In some cases, supply shortages will substantially curtail production of all assemblies using a particular component. In addition, at various times industry wide shortages of electronic components have occurred, particularly of memory and logic devices. Such circumstances have produced insignificant levels of short term interruption of our operations, but could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the future. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation and Business Components Procurement. We may not be able to maintain our engineering, technological and manufacturing process expertise. The markets for our manufacturing and engineering services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving process development. The continued success of our business will depend upon our ability to: hire, retain and expand our qualified engineering and technical personnel; maintain technological leadership; develop and market manufacturing services that meet changing customer needs; and 35 Table of Contents successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes on a cost effective and timely basis. Although we believe that our operations use the assembly and testing technologies, equipment and processes that are currently required by our customers, we cannot be certain that we will develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future. The emergence of new technology, industry standards or customer requirements may render our equipment, inventory or processes obsolete or noncompetitive. In addition, we may have to acquire new assembly and testing technologies and equipment to remain competitive. The acquisition and implementation of new technologies and equipment may require significant expense or capital investment, which could reduce our operating margins and our operating results. In facilities that we establish or acquire, we may not be able to maintain our engineering, technological and manufacturing process expertise. Our failure to anticipate and adapt to our customers changing technological needs and requirements or to maintain our engineering, technological and manufacturing expertise, could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we manufacture products containing design or manufacturing defects, or if our manufacturing processes do not comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, demand for our services may decline and we may be subject to liability claims. We manufacture and design products to our customers specifications, and, in some cases, our manufacturing processes and facilities may need to comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. For example, medical devices that we manufacture or design, as well as the facilities and manufacturing processes that we use to produce them, are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. Similarly, items we manufacture for customers in defense and aerospace industries, as well as the processes we use to produce them, are regulated by the Department of Defense and the Federal Aviation Authority. In addition, our customers products and the manufacturing processes that we use to produce them often are highly complex. As a result, products that we manufacture may at times contain manufacturing or design defects, and our manufacturing processes may be subject to errors or not be in compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. Defects in the products we manufacture or design, whether caused by a design, manufacturing or component failure or error, or deficiencies in our manufacturing processes, may result in delayed shipments to customers or reduced or cancelled customer orders. If these defects or deficiencies are significant, our business reputation may also be damaged. The failure of the products that we manufacture or our manufacturing processes and facilities to comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements may subject us to legal fines or penalties and, in some cases, require us to shut down or incur considerable expense to correct a manufacturing process or facility. In addition, these defects may result in liability claims against us or expose us to liability to pay for the recall of a product. The magnitude of such claims may increase as we expand our medical, automotive, and aerospace and defense manufacturing services, as defects in medical devices, automotive components, and aerospace and defense systems could kill or seriously harm users of these products and others. Even if our customers are responsible for the defects, they may not, or may not have resources to, assume responsibility for any costs or liabilities arising from these defects. Our increasing design services offerings may increase our exposure to product liability, intellectual property infringement and other claims. We have increased our efforts to offer certain design services, primarily those relating to products that we manufacture for our customers. Providing such services can expose us to different or greater potential liabilities than those we face from providing our regular manufacturing services. Historically, we have generally not agreed in our customer contracts to be liable for product design defects. However, with the growth of our design services business, we are assuming some of those risks. As a result, we have increasing exposure to potential product liability claims resulting from injuries resulting from defects in products we design, as well as potential claims that products we design infringe on third parties intellectual property. Such claims could subject us to significant liability for damages and, regardless of their merits, could be time consuming and expensive to resolve. We also may have greater potential 36 Table of Contents exposure with respect to products we design that may be recalled due to product problems. Costs associated with possible product liability claims, intellectual property infringement claims and product recalls could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Any delay in the implementation of our information systems could disrupt our operations and cause unanticipated increases in our costs. We have completed the installation of an Enterprise Resource Planning system in sixteen of our manufacturing sites and in our corporate location. We are in the process of installing this system in certain of our remaining plants, which will replace the current Manufacturing Resource Planning system, and financial information systems. Any delay in the implementation of these information systems could result in material adverse consequences, including disruption of operations, loss of information and unanticipated increases in cost. Compliance or the failure to comply with current and future environmental regulations could cause us significant expense. We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process. If we fail to comply with any present and future regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production. In addition, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment, or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Certain of our existing stockholders have significant control. As of August 31, 2003, our executive officers, directors and certain of their family members collectively beneficially own 21.1% of our outstanding common stock, of which William D. Morean, our Chairman of the Board, beneficially owns 15.3%. As a result, our executive officers, directors and certain of their family members have significant influence over (1) the election of our Board of Directors, (2) the approval or disapproval of any other matters requiring stockholder approval, and (3) the affairs and policies of Jabil. We are subject to the risk of increased taxes. We base our tax position upon the anticipated nature and conduct of our business and upon our understanding of the tax laws of the various countries in which we have assets or conduct activities. Our tax position, however, is subject to review and possible challenge by taxing authorities and to possible changes in law. We cannot determine in advance the extent to which some jurisdictions may assess additional tax or interest and penalties on such additional taxes. Several countries in which we are located allow for tax holidays or provide other tax incentives to attract and retain business. We have obtained holidays or other incentives where available. Our taxes could increase if certain tax holidays or incentives are retracted, or if they are not renewed upon expiration, or tax rates applicable to us in such jurisdictions are otherwise increased. In addition, further acquisitions may cause our effective tax rate to increase. Our credit rating is subject to change. Our credit is rated by credit rating agencies. For example, our 5.875% Senior Notes were rated Baa3 by Moodys Investor Service, which is considered investment grade debt and BB+ by Standard and Poors Rating Service, which is considered one level below investment grade debt. If in the future our credit rating is downgraded so that neither credit rating agency rates our 5.875% Senior Notes as investment grade debt, such a downgrade may increase our cost of capital should we borrow under our revolving credit facilities, may make it more expensive for us to raise additional capital in the future on 37 Table of Contents terms that are acceptable to us or at all, may negatively impact the price of our common stock and may have other negative implications on our business, many of which are beyond our control. We are subject to risks of currency fluctuations and related hedging operations. A portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates among other currencies and the U.S. dollar will affect our cost of sales, operating margins and revenues. We cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations. We use financial instruments, primarily forward purchase contracts, to hedge U.S. dollar and other currency commitments arising from trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable and fixed purchase obligations. If these hedging activities are not successful or we change or reduce these hedging activities in the future, we may experience significant unexpected expenses from fluctuations in exchange rates. An adverse change in the interest rates for our borrowings could adversely affect our financial condition. We pay interest on outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and other long term debt obligations at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base interest rates. An adverse change in the base rates upon which our interest rates are determined could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We are exposed to intangible asset risk. We have recorded intangible assets, including goodwill, in connection with business acquisitions. We are required to perform goodwill impairment tests at least on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows. As a result of our annual and other periodic evaluations, we may determine that the intangible asset values need to be written down to their fair values, which could result in material charges that could be adverse to our operating results and financial position. Consolidation in industries that utilize electronics components may adversely affect our business. In the current economic climate, consolidation in industries that utilize electronics components may further increase as companies combine to achieve further economies of scale and other synergies. Consolidation in industries that utilize electronics components could result in an increase in excess manufacturing capacity as companies seek to divest manufacturing operations or eliminate duplicative product lines. Excess manufacturing capacity has increased, and may continue to increase, pricing and competitive pressures for the EMS industry as a whole and for us in particular. Consolidation could also result in an increasing number of very large companies offering products in multiple industry sectors. The significant purchasing power and market power of these large companies could increase pricing and competitive pressures for us. If one of our customers is acquired by another company that does not rely on us to provide services and has its own production facilities or relies on another provider of similar services, we may lose that customers business. Such consolidation among our customers may further reduce the number of customers that generate a significant percentage of our revenues and exposes us to increased risks relating to dependence on a small number of customers. Any of the foregoing results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business. Customer relationships with emerging companies may present more risks than with established companies. Customer relationships with emerging companies present special risks because such companies do not have an extensive product history. As a result, there is less demonstration of market acceptance of their products making it harder for us to anticipate needs and requirements than with established customers. Also, due to the current economic environment, additional funding for such companies may be more difficult to obtain and these customer relationships may not continue or materialize to the extent we plan or we previously experienced. This tightening of financing for start up customers, together with many start 38 Table of Contents up customers lack of prior earnings and unproven product markets increase our credit risk, especially in accounts receivable and inventories. Although we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust our reserves for accounts receivable and inventories for all customers, including start up customers, based on the information available, these reserves may not be adequate. This risk exists for any new emerging company customers in the future. Our stock price may be volatile. Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and could fluctuate substantially in the future, based on a variety of factors, including future announcements covering us or our key customers or competitors, government regulations, litigation, changes in earnings estimates by analysts, fluctuations in quarterly operating results, or general conditions in the EMS, automotive, computing and storage, consumer products, instrumentation and medical, networking, peripherals and telecommunications industries. Furthermore, stock prices for many companies, and high technology companies in particular, fluctuate widely for reasons that may be unrelated to their operating results. Those fluctuations and general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions or international currency fluctuations and demand for our services, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law may have certain anti takeover effects. The Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws each contain certain provisions that may, in effect, discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of Jabil or unsolicited acquisition proposals from taking place. Generally, we do not have employment agreements with any of our key personnel, the loss of which could hurt our operations. Our continued success depends largely on the efforts and skills of our key managerial and technical employees. The loss of the services of certain of these key employees or an inability to attract or retain qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on us. Generally, we do not have employment agreements or non competition agreements with our key employees. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Currency Exchange Risks We transact business in various foreign countries and are, therefore, subject to risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We enter into forward contracts to hedge transactional exposure associated with commitments arising from trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable and fixed purchase obligations denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective operating entity. On September 1, 2000, the Company adopted SFAS 133, as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activity, an Amendment of SFAS 133 and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 149, Amendment on Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. In accordance with these standards, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their respective fair market values. The aggregate notional amount of outstanding contracts as of August 31, 2003 was $122.3 million. The fair value of these contracts amounted to $1.2 million and was recorded as a net liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The forward contracts will generally expire in less than three months, with seven months being the maximum term of the contracts outstanding at August 31, 2003. The forward contracts will settle in British Pounds, Euros, Hungarian Forints, Mexican Pesos, Japanese Yen, Swiss Francs and U.S. dollars. 39 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk A portion of our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio. We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. We place cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions. We protect our invested principal funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities and by constantly positioning the portfolio to respond appropriately to a reduction in credit rating of any investment issuer, guarantor or depository to levels below the credit ratings dictated by our investment policy. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. As of August 31, 2003, the outstanding amount in the investment portfolio was $213.4 million, comprised mainly of money market funds with an average return of 0.97%. We have issued convertible debt with a principal maturity of $345 million due in May 2021. The notes can be redeemed by the holder at par value plus accrued interest on May 15, 2004, May 15, 2006, May 15, 2009 and May 15, 2014. We are not exposed to interest rate risk on the convertible debt because (i) the interest on the principal amount is fixed at 1.75%, (ii) the principal payable at maturity is fixed and (iii) the conversion into our common stock is fixed. We have also issued senior notes with a principal maturity of $300 million due in July 2010. The notes bear a fixed interest rate of 5.875%, which is payable semiannually on January 15 and July 15. We entered into an interest rate swap transaction to effectively convert the fixed interest rate of the 5.875% Senior Notes to a variable rate. The swap, which expires in 2010, is accounted for as a fair value hedge under SFAS 133. The notional amount of the swap is $300 million. Under the terms of the swap, we will pay an interest rate equal to the six month LIBOR rate, set in arrears, plus a fixed spread of 1.945%. In exchange, we will receive a fixed rate of 5.875%. At August 31, 2003, $17 million has been recorded in other long term liabilities to record the fair value of the interest rate swap, with a corresponding decrease to the carrying value of the 5.875% Senior Notes on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We pay interest on outstanding borrowings under our Amended Revolver and our 0.6 million JPY credit facility at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base interest rates. There were no borrowings outstanding under these revolving credit facilities at August 31, 2003. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation and Factors Affecting Future Results We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our international operations, which may be subject to a number of risks and often require more management time and expense to achieve profitability than our domestic operations, and An adverse change in the interest rates for our borrowings could adversely affect our financial condition. See Note 1 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 5 Notes Payable, Long Term Debt and Long Term Lease Obligations and Note 10 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
