You should read this document and the documents that we incorporate by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10 K completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We may not update these forward looking statements, even if our situation changes in the future. All forward looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified by these cautionary statements. Overview We are one of the leading providers of worldwide electronic manufacturing services and solutions. We provide comprehensive electronics design, production, product management and repair services to companies in the aerospace, automotive, computing, consumer, defense, industrial, instrumentation, medical, networking, peripherals, storage and telecommunications industries. The historical growth of the overall industry over most of the 1990s was driven by the increasing number of companies who chose to outsource their manufacturing requirements. In mid 2001, the industrys revenue declined as a result of significant cut backs in customer production requirements, which was consistent with the overall global economic downturn at that time. Industry revenues generally began to stabilize in 2003 and companies continue to turn to outsourcing versus internal manufacturing. We anticipate that this industry outsourcing trend will continue during the next several years. We derive revenue principally from the product sales of electronic equipment built to customer specifications. We recognize revenue, net of estimated product return costs, generally when goods are shipped, title and risk of ownership have passed, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and recoverability is reasonably assured. The volume and timing of orders placed by our customers vary due to several factors, including: variation in demand for our customers products; our customers attempts to manage their inventory; electronic design changes; changes in our customers manufacturing strategies; and acquisitions of or consolidations among our customers. Demand for our customers products depends on, among other things, product life cycles, competitive conditions and general economic conditions. Our cost of revenue includes the cost of electronic components and other materials that comprise the products we manufacture; the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead; and adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory. As a provider of turnkey manufacturing services, we are responsible for procuring components and other materials. This requires us to commit significant working capital to our operations and to manage the purchasing, receiving, inspection and stocking of materials. Although we bear the risk of fluctuations in the cost of materials and excess scrap, we periodically negotiate cost of materials adjustments with our customers. Net revenue from each product that we manufacture consists of an element based on the costs of materials in that product and an element based on the labor and manufacturing overhead costs allocated to that product. We refer to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on materials costs as material based revenue, and to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on labor and manufacturing overhead costs as manufacturing based revenue. Our gross margin for any product depends on the mix between the cost of materials in the product and the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead allocated to the product. We typically realize higher gross margins on manufacturing based revenue than we do on materials based revenue. As we gain experience in manufacturing a product, we usually achieve increased efficiencies, which result in lower labor and manufacturing overhead costs for that product. Our operating results are impacted by the level of capacity utilization of manufacturing facilities; indirect labor costs; and selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high production volume and high capacity utilization. During periods of low production volume, we generally have idle capacity and reduced operating income margins. As our capacity has grown during recent years through the construction of new greenfield facilities, the expansion of existing facilities and our acquisition of additional facilities, our selling, general and administrative expenses have increased to support this growth. We have consistently utilized advanced circuit design, production design and manufacturing technologies to meet the needs of our customers. To support this effort, our engineering staff focuses on 20 Table of Contents developing and refining design and manufacturing technologies to meet specific needs of specific customers. Most of the expenses associated with these customer specific efforts are reflected in our cost of revenue. In addition, our engineers engage in R&D of new technologies that apply generally to our operations. The expenses of these R&D activities are reflected in the Research and Development line item in our Consolidated Statement of Earnings. An important element of our strategy is the expansion of our global production facilities. The majority of our revenue and materials costs worldwide are denominated in U.S. dollars, while our labor and utility costs in plants outside the United States are denominated in local currencies. We hedge these local currency costs, based on our evaluation of the potential exposure as compared to the cost of the hedge, through the purchase of foreign exchange contracts. Changes in the fair market value of such hedging instruments are reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. See Risk Factors We are subject to risks of currency fluctuations and related hedging operations. We currently depend, and expect to continue to depend, upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue. A significant reduction in sales to any of our large customers or a customer exerting significant pricing and margin pressures on us would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In the past, some of our customers have terminated their manufacturing arrangements with us or have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of manufacturing services ordered from us. There can be no assurance that present or future customers will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us or significantly change, reduce or delay the amount of manufacturing services ordered from us. Any such termination of a manufacturing relationship or change, reduction or delay in orders could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. See Risk Factors Because we depend on a limited number of customers, a reduction in sales to any one of our customers could cause a significant decline in our revenue and Note 9 Concentration of Risk and Segment Data to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Summary of Results Net revenue for fiscal year 2005 increased 20 percent to $7.5 billion compared to $6.3 billion for fiscal year 2004. Our sales levels during fiscal year 2005 improved across most industry sectors, demonstrating our continued trend of industry sector and customer diversification. The increase in our net revenue base year over year primarily represents stronger demand from existing programs, as well as organic growth from new and existing customers. The following table sets forth, for the fiscal year ended August 31, certain key operating results and other financial information (in thousands, except per share data). Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2005 2004 2003 Net revenue $ 7,524,386 $ 6,252,897 $ 4,729,482 Gross profit $ 628,506 $ 538,380 $ 435,466 Operating income $ 287,371 $ 216,015 $ 44,453 Net income $ 231,847 $ 166,900 $ 43,007 Basic earnings per share $ 1.14 $ 0.83 $ 0.22 Diluted earnings per share $ 1.12 $ 0.81 $ 0.21 21 Table of Contents Key Performance Indicators Management regularly reviews financial and non financial performance indicators to assess the Companys operating results. The following table sets forth, for the quarterly periods indicated, certain of managements key financial performance indicators. Three Months Ended August 31, May 31, February 28, November 30, 2005 2005 2005 2004 Sales cycle 17 days 20 days 23 days 28 days Inventory turns 9 turns 10 turns 9 turns 9 turns Days in accounts receivable 42 days 42 days 42 days 52 days Days in inventory 39 days 37 days 39 days 40 days Days in accounts payable 64 days 59 days 58 days 64 days Three Months Ended August 31, May 31, February 29, November 30, 2004 2004 2004 2003 Sales cycle 26 days 26 days 26 days 33 days Inventory turns 9 turns 9 turns 8 turns 9 turns Days in accounts receivable 43 days 40 days 42 days 52 days Days in inventory 40 days 40 days 45 days 39 days Days in accounts payable 57 days 54 days 61 days 58 days The sales cycle is calculated as the sum of days in accounts receivable and days in inventory, less the days in accounts payable; accordingly, the variance in the sales cycle quarter over quarter is a direct result of changes in these indicators. Days in accounts receivable have remained consistent during the three months ended August 31, 2005 from the prior sequential quarter. During the three months ended May 31, 2005, days in accounts receivable decreased by three days due to the sale of receivables to an unrelated third party. This decrease was offset by a three day increase in days in accounts receivable due to the timing of sales during the third fiscal quarter and the assumption of receivables in connection with our acquisition of Varian Electronics Manufacturing (VEM), the electronics manufacturing business segment of Varian, Inc. The ten day decrease in accounts receivable days for the three months ended February 28, 2005 resulted primarily from the liquidation during such quarter of six days of receivables assumed in connection with our acquisition of certain operations of Philips in Kwidzyn, Poland at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2005. The remainder of the decrease reflects lower sales levels and timing of sales during the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Days in inventory increased two days during the three months ended August 31, 2005 from the prior sequential quarter, resulting in a decrease in inventory turns to nine. The two day increase in days during the fourth fiscal quarter was primarily due to increased purchasing to meet forecasted demand in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006, which includes the seasonal peak for the consumer and automotive industry sectors. Days in inventory decreased two days during the three months ended May 31, 2005 from the prior sequential quarter as a result of increased sales during this period and the continued emphasis on inventory management. Inventory levels at February 28, 2005 were elevated due to ramping for the third fiscal quarter production forecasts. The improvement in days in inventory resulted in ten inventory turns during the three months ended May 31, 2005, as compared to nine inventory turns in the prior sequential quarter. Days in accounts payable increased five days during the three months ended August 31, 2005 from the prior sequential quarter primarily as a result of increased inventory levels and continued emphasis on extending payment terms with our vendors. Days in accounts payable increased one day during the three months ended May 31, 2005 from the prior sequential quarter primarily due to the timing of payments due to vendors. The six day decrease in days in accounts payable during the three months ended February 28, 2005 from the prior sequential quarter resulted from the liquidation during such quarter of six days of 22 Table of Contents payables assumed in connection with our acquisition of certain operations of Philips in Kwidzyn, Poland at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2005. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. Management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances. We have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. For further discussion of our significant accounting policies, refer to Note 1 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition We derive revenue principally from the product sales of electronic equipment built to customer specifications. We also derive revenue to a lesser extent from repair services, design services and excess inventory sales. Revenue from product sales and excess inventory sales is generally recognized, net of estimated product return costs, when goods are shipped; title and risk of ownership have passed; the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and recoverability is reasonably assured. Service related revenues are recognized upon completion of the services. We assume no significant obligations after product shipment. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts related to receivables not expected to be collected from our customers. This allowance is based on managements assessment of specific customer balances, considering the age of receivables and financial stability of the customer. If there is an adverse change in the financial condition of our customers, or if actual defaults are higher than provided for, an addition to the allowance may be necessary. Inventory Valuation We purchase inventory based on forecasted demand and record inventory at the lower of cost or market. Management regularly assesses inventory valuation based on current and forecasted usage and other lower of cost or market considerations. If actual market conditions or our customers product demands are less favorable than those projected, additional valuation adjustments may be necessary. Long Lived Assets We review property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of property, plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the projected cash flows the property, plant and equipment are expected to generate. If the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the long lived asset over its respective fair value. The impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management, including revenue and cash flow projections. Circumstances that may lead to impairment of property, plant and equipment include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand and the restructuring of our operations resulting from a change in our business strategy. We have recorded intangible assets, including goodwill, principally based on third party valuations, in connection with business acquisitions. Estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are determined by management based on an assessment of the period over which the asset is expected to 23 Table of Contents contribute to future cash flows. The allocation of amortizable intangible assets impacts the amounts allocable to goodwill. In accordance with SFAS 142, we are required to perform a goodwill impairment test at least on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows. We completed the annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and determined that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test. The impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level, which we have determined to be consistent with our operating segments as defined in Note 9 Concentration of Risk and Segment Data to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The impairment analysis is based on assumptions of future results made by management, including revenue and cash flow projections at the reporting unit level. Circumstances that may lead to impairment of goodwill or intangible assets include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand, and the restructuring of our operations resulting from a change in our business strategy. For further information on our intangible assets, including goodwill, refer to Note 4 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Restructuring and Impairment Charges We have recognized restructuring and impairment charges related to reductions in workforce, re sizing and closure of facilities and the transition of certain facilities into new customer development sites. These charges were recorded pursuant to formal plans developed and approved by management. The recognition of restructuring and impairment charges requires that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature, timing and amount of costs associated with these plans. The estimates of future liabilities may change, requiring additional restructuring and impairment charges or the reduction of liabilities already recorded. At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with the restructuring programs. For further discussion of our restructuring programs, refer to Note 13 Restructuring and Impairment Charges to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Restructuring and Impairment Charges. Pension and Postretirement Benefits We have pension and postretirement benefit costs and liabilities, which are developed from actuarial valuations. Actuarial valuations require management to make certain judgments and estimates of discount rates and return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions on a regular basis taking into consideration current market conditions and historical market data. The discount rate is used to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date. This rate represents the market rate for high quality fixed income investments. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. When considering the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets, we take into account current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on plan assets. Other assumptions include demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover. For further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefits, refer to Note 7 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes We estimate our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, a process that includes estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities. We must also make judgments regarding the ability to realize the deferred tax assets. The carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets that we do not believe meet the more likely than not criteria established by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Our judgments regarding future taxable income may change due to changes in market conditions, changes in tax laws or other factors. If our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future, the valuation 24 Table of Contents allowances we have established may be increased or decreased, resulting in a respective increase or decrease in either income tax expense or goodwill. For further discussion related to our income taxes, refer to Note 6 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain operating data as a percentage of net revenue: Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2005 2004 2003 Net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenue 91.7 91.4 90.8 Gross profit 8.3 8.6 9.2 Selling, general and administrative 3.7 4.2 5.2 Research and development 0.3 0.2 0.2 Amortization of intangibles 0.5 0.7 0.8 Acquisition related charges 0.3 Restructuring and impairment charges 1.8 Operating income 3.8 3.5 0.9 Other loss (income) 0.1 (0.1 ) Interest income (0.2 ) (0.1 ) (0.1 ) Interest expense 0.3 0.3 0.3 Income before income taxes 3.7 3.2 0.8 Income tax expense (benefit) 0.6 0.5 (0.1 ) Net income 3.1 % 2.7 % 0.9 % Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2005 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2004 Net Revenue. Our net revenue increased 20.3% to $7.5 billion for fiscal year 2005, up from $6.3 billion in fiscal year 2004. The increase was due to increased sales levels across most industry sectors. Specific increases include a 40% increase in the sale of consumer products; a 59% increase in the sale of instrumentation and medical products; a 40% increase in the sale of peripheral products; a 19% increase in the sale of computing and storage products; and a 9% increase in the sale of automotive products. The increased sales levels were due to the addition of new customers, acquisitions and organic growth in these industry sectors. The increase in the consumer industry sector was primarily attributable to new and existing program growth resulting from our product diversification efforts within the sector. The increase in the instrumentation and medical industry sector was primarily attributable to increased sales levels as more vertical companies are electing to outsource their production in these areas, and the acquisition of VEM. These increases were offset by an 8% decrease in the sale of telecommunications products and an 8% decrease in the sale of networking products. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, revenue by industry sector expressed as a percentage of net revenue. The distribution of revenue across our industry sectors has fluctuated, and will continue to fluctuate, as a result of numerous factors, including but not limited to the following: increased business from new and existing customers; fluctuations in customer demand; seasonality, especially in the automotive and consumer industry sectors; and increased growth in the automotive, consumer, and instrumentation and medical products industry sectors as more vertical companies are electing to outsource their production in these areas. 25 Table of Contents Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2005 2004 2003 Automotive 7% 8% 9% Computing and storage 12% 13% 15% Consumer 29% 25% 20% Instrumentation and medical 16% 12% 7% Networking 15% 20% 23% Peripherals 8% 6% 8% Telecommunications 9% 11% 14% Other 4% 5% 4% Total 100% 100% 100% Foreign source revenue represented 83.8% of our net revenue for fiscal year 2005 and 84.6% of net revenue for fiscal year 2004. We expect our foreign source revenue to increase as a percentage of total net revenue due to expansion in China, Eastern Europe and India, and due to the continued shift of production to lower cost regions. Gross Profit. Gross profit decreased to 8.3% of net revenue in fiscal year 2005 from 8.6% in fiscal year 2004. The percentage decrease from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to a higher portion of materials based revenue (driven in part by growth in the consumer industry sector), combined with the continued shift of production to lower cost regions. In absolute dollars, gross profit for fiscal year 2005 increased $90.1 million versus fiscal year 2004 due to the increased revenue base. Selling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $278.9 million (3.7% of net revenue) in fiscal year 2005 from $263.5 million (4.2% of net revenue) in fiscal year 2004. The absolute dollar increase was primarily due to additional personnel costs related to the realignment of our organizational structure into three regional operating segments, costs related to compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, and the acquisition of VEM in March 2005. The decrease as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to the increased revenue base. R&D. R&D expenses in fiscal year 2005 increased to $22.5 million (0.3% of net revenue) from $13.8 million (0.2% of net revenue) in fiscal year 2004. The increase is attributed to growth in our product development activities related to new reference designs, including networking and server products, cell phone products, wireless and broadband access products, consumer products, and storage products. We also continued efforts in the design of circuit board assembly; mechanical design and the related production design process; and the development of new advanced manufacturing technologies. Amortization of Intangibles. We recorded $39.8 million of amortization of intangibles in fiscal year 2005 as compared to $43.7 million in fiscal year 2004. The decrease was attributable to intangible assets that became fully amortized in fiscal year 2005, offset by amortization of intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions consummated in fiscal year 2005. For additional information regarding purchased intangibles, see Acquisitions and Expansion below, Note 1(f) Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Note 4 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Note 12 Business Acquisitions and Other Transactions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Acquisition related Charges. During fiscal year 2005, we did not incur acquisition related charges. During fiscal year 2004, we incurred $1.3 million in acquisition related charges in connection with the acquisitions of certain operations of Philips and NEC. Restructuring and Impairment Charges. There were no restructuring and impairment charges incurred during fiscal years 2005 and 2004. At August 31, 2005, liabilities related to restructuring activities 26 Table of Contents carried out prior to August 31, 2003 totaled approximately $4.9 million for lease commitment costs, which is expected to be paid out within the next twelve months. The historical restructuring programs discussed in Note 13 Restructuring and Impairment Charges to the Consolidated Financial Statements allowed us to align our production capacity and shift our geographic footprint to meet current customer requirements. We continuously evaluate our operations and cost structure relative to general economic conditions, market demands and cost competitiveness, and our geographic footprint as it relates to our customers production requirements. A change in any of these factors could result in additional restructuring and impairment charges in the future. Other Loss (Income). During fiscal year 2004, we recorded a $6.4 million loss on the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs, which resulted from the redemption of our convertible subordinated notes in May 2004. See Note 5 Notes Payable, Long Term Debt and Long Term Lease Obligations to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the redemption. Interest Income. Interest income increased to $13.8 million in fiscal year 2005 from $7.2 million in fiscal year 2004. The increase was primarily due to higher interest yields on cash deposits and short term investments, and interest income recorded in relation to the note receivable from an unrelated third party. For further discussion of the note receivable, see Note 12 Business Acquisitions and Other Transactions to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $24.8 million in fiscal year 2005, from $19.4 million in fiscal year 2004. The increase was primarily a result of higher base interest rates related to our $300.0 million 5.875% senior notes issued in July of 2003 (the Senior Notes), as we had an interest rate swap in place that effectively converted the fixed interest rate of the Senior Notes to a variable rate through the interest rate swap termination date of June 3, 2005. The increase was also a result of temporary borrowings under the revolving credit facility and debt agreements entered into during the third quarter of fiscal year 2005 in connection with the VEM acquisition. The increase for fiscal year 2005 was partially offset by the redemption of our Convertible Notes in May 2004. See Note 5 Notes Payable, Long Term Debt and Long Term Lease Obligations to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes. Income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of 16.1% for fiscal year 2005, as compared to an effective tax rate of 15.5% for fiscal year 2004. The tax rate is predominantly a function of the mix of tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we do business. Our international operations have historically been taxed at a lower rate than in the United States, primarily due to tax incentives, including tax holidays, granted to our sites in Brazil, China, Hungary, India, Malaysia and Poland that expire at various dates through 2017. Such tax holidays are subject to conditions with which we expect to continue to comply. See Note 6 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In October 2004, the President signed into law the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act). The Act creates a temporary incentive for U.S. multinational companies to repatriate accumulated foreign earnings by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain eligible dividends The deduction is subject to a number of limitations and requirements, including a formal plan for domestic reinvestment of the dividends. In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 109 2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (FSP 109 2). FSP 109 2 provides guidance under SFAS 109 with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the Act on enterprises income tax expense and deferred tax liability. FSP 109 2 states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the Act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying SFAS 109. The Company may make this election with respect to repatriation of qualifying earnings in either fiscal year 2005 or 2006. We are currently evaluating the effects of the repatriation provision and expect to complete the evaluation no later than the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2006. At this time, the range of earnings that may be repatriated and the potential range of income tax effects of such repatriation cannot be reasonably estimated. 27 Table of Contents Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2004 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2003 Net Revenue. Our net revenue increased 32.2% to $6.3 billion for fiscal year 2004, up from $4.7 billion in fiscal year 2003. The increase was due to increased sales levels across all industry sectors. Specific increases included a 61% increase in the sale of consumer products; a 134% increase in the sale of instrumentation and medical products; a 15% increase in the sale of networking products; an 18% increase in the sale of automotive products; a 10% increase in the sale of computing and storage products; a 10% increase in the sale of peripheral products; and a 6% increase in the sale of telecommunications products. The increased sales levels were due to the addition of new customers, acquisitions and organic growth in these industry sectors. The increase in the consumer industry sector was primarily attributable to the acquisition of certain operations of Philips during fiscal year 2003. The increase in the instrumentation and medical industry sector was primarily attributable to increased sales levels as more vertical companies are electing to outsource their production in these areas. Foreign source revenue represented 84.6% of our net revenue for fiscal year 2004 and 80.7% of net revenue for fiscal year 2003. The increase in foreign source revenue was primarily attributable to incremental revenue resulting from our acquisitions in Austria, Brazil, Belgium, China, Hungary, India, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland and Singapore during fiscal year 2003. Gross Profit. Gross profit decreased to 8.6% of net revenue in fiscal year 2004 from 9.2% in fiscal year 2003. The percentage decrease was primarily due to a higher portion of materials based revenue (driven in part by growth in the consumer industry sector), combined with the continued shift of production to lower cost regions. The mix of value add based revenue from our acquisitions also contributed to the decrease. Additionally, we were awarded a significant amount of new business during fiscal year 2004. The level of activity required to integrate new business into our factories typically has a slightly dilutive impact on gross profit during the initial period of production where certain costs are incurred before any corresponding increase in revenues might occur. As production for the new business increases, the contribution to gross profit typically increases. The percentage decrease in gross profit for fiscal year 2004 versus fiscal year 2003 was partially offset by cost reductions realized from our restructuring activities in previous fiscal years. In absolute dollars, gross profit for fiscal year 2004 increased $102.9 million versus fiscal year 2003 due to the increased revenue base. Selling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $263.5 million (4.2% of net revenue) in fiscal year 2004 from $243.7 million (5.2% of net revenue) in fiscal year 2003. The absolute dollar increase was primarily attributable to operations acquired during fiscal year 2003 and to operations in facilities for which construction was completed during fiscal year 2003. These increases were partially offset by $1.2 million of quarterly cost reductions realized from our restructuring activities. The decrease as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to the increased revenue base in fiscal year 2004 and the cost reductions realized from our restructuring activities. R&D. R&D expenses in fiscal year 2004 increased to $13.8 million from $9.9 million in fiscal year 2003 but remained at 0.2% of net revenue for each of the fiscal years ended August 31, 2004 and 2003. We continued to engage in R&D activities at our historical levels. These activities included design of circuit board assemblies and the related production process; development of new products and products associated with customer design related programs; and new failure analysis techniques. Amortization of Intangibles. We recorded $43.7 million of amortization of intangibles in fiscal year 2004 as compared to $36.9 million in fiscal year 2003. The increase was attributable to acquired amortizable intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions consummated in fiscal year 2003. For additional information regarding purchased intangibles, see Acquisitions and Expansion below, Note 1(f) Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and Note 4 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. 28 Table of Contents Acquisition related Charges. During fiscal year 2004, we incurred $1.3 million in acquisition related charges in connection with the acquisitions of certain operations of Philips and NEC. During fiscal year 2003, we incurred $15.3 million in acquisition related charges in connection with the acquisitions of certain operations of Quantum, Alcatel, Valeo, Lucent, Seagate, Philips and NEC. Restructuring and Impairment Charges. There were no restructuring and impairment charges incurred during fiscal year 2004. During fiscal year 2003, we continued a restructuring program to reduce our cost structure and further align our manufacturing capacity with geographic production demands of our customers. This restructuring program resulted in restructuring and impairment charges of $85.3 million for fiscal year 2003. At August 31, 2004, liabilities related to our restructuring activities totaled approximately $10.7 million. Approximately $5.9 million of this total was expected to be paid out within the next twelve months for severance and benefit payments related to the remaining restructuring activities and lease commitment costs. The remaining balance, consisting of lease commitment costs, is expected to be paid out through August 31, 2006. As a result of the restructuring activities completed through August 31, 2003, we realized a cumulative cost savings of approximately $24.0 million during fiscal year 2004. This cost savings consisted of $19.2 million reduction in cost of revenue due to a reduction in employee payroll and benefit expense of $11.6 million and $7.6 million in depreciation expense, and $4.8 million reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses. Other Loss (Income). During fiscal year 2004, we recorded a $6.4 million loss on the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs, which resulted from the redemption of our convertible subordinated notes in May 2004. See Note 5 Notes Payable, Long Term Debt and Long Term Lease Obligations to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the redemption. During fiscal year 2003, we recorded $2.6 million of other income related to proceeds received in the first quarter of fiscal year 2003 in connection with facility closure costs. Interest Income. Interest income increased to $7.2 million in fiscal year 2004 from $6.9 million in fiscal year 2003. The increase was primarily due to higher average cash balances, partially offset by lower interest yields on cash deposits and short term investments. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $19.4 million in fiscal year 2004, from $17.0 million in fiscal year 2003. This increase was primarily a result of the issuance of our $300.0 million, seven year, 5.875% senior notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003, which are effectively converted to a variable rate by our interest rate swap. This increase was partially offset by the redemption of our 1.75% convertible subordinated notes in May 2004. See Note 5 Notes Payable, Long Term Debt and Long Term Lease Obligations to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes. Income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of 15.5% for fiscal year 2004, as compared to an income tax benefit of 16.4% for fiscal year 2003. The tax rate is predominantly a function of the mix of tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we do business. The amount of restructuring charges recorded during fiscal year 2003, and the fact that the income taxes associated with the restructuring charges were calculated using the effective tax rates in the jurisdictions in which those charges were incurred, resulted in an income tax benefit in the prior fiscal year. In addition, as the proportion of our income derived from foreign sources has increased, our effective tax rate, excluding the impact of restructuring charges, has decreased. Our international operations have historically been taxed at a lower rate than in the United States, primarily due to tax incentives, including tax holidays, granted to our sites in Brazil, China, Hungary, Malaysia, Poland, and Ukraine that expire at various dates through 2012 as of August 31, 2004. Such tax holidays are subject to conditions with which we expect to continue to comply. See Note 6 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 29 Table of Contents Quarterly Results (Unaudited) The following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly financial information for the 2005 and 2004 fiscal years.

Our consolidated financial statements include the operating results of each business from the date of acquisition. See Risk Factors We may not achieve expected profitability from our acquisitions. For further discussion of our recent and planned acquisitions, see Note 12 Business Acquisitions and Other Transactions and Note 16 Subsequent Event to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, we commenced operations in phase one of our new facility in Szombathely, Hungary, which will support our repair services operations in Europe. We expect to complete the second phase of construction in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006. Also during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, we completed construction of and commenced operations in our new manufacturing facility in Ranjangaon, India. Construction of our new manufacturing facility in Wuxi, China continues and we expect to commence operations in this facility by the second quarter of fiscal year 2006. Seasonality Production levels for our consumer and automotive industry sectors are subject to seasonal influences. We may realize greater net revenue during our first fiscal quarter due to high demand for consumer products during the holiday selling season. Liquidity and Capital Resources At August 31, 2005, we had cash and cash equivalent balances totaling $796.1 million, total notes payable, long term debt and capital lease obligations of $327.3 million and $505.4 million available for borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and accounts receivable securitization program. 31 Table of Contents The following table sets forth, for the fiscal year ended August 31, selected consolidated cash flow information (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2005 2004 2003 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 590,001 $ 451,241 $ 263,493 Net cash used in investing activities (488,694 ) (205,593 ) (517,493 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 60,940 (318,440 ) 312,420 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 12,502 (5,634 ) 593 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 174,749 $ (78,426 ) $ 59,013 Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2005 was $590.0 million. This consisted primarily of $231.8 million of net income, $220.1 million of depreciation and amortization, $244.1 million from increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and $21.1 million from decreases in prepaid expenses and other current assets. The increase in accounts payable was due to the increase in inventory and timing of purchases near year end. Additionally, accrued compensation and employee benefits increased over the prior fiscal year due to the increase in number of employees at August 31, 2005. These sources of cash were partially offset by increases in inventory of $106.3 million and increases in accounts receivable of $31.1 million. The increase in inventory was due to increased levels of business during fiscal year 2005 and positioning for estimated future demand. The increase in accounts receivable was due to the increased revenue base and the timing of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2005 was $488.7 million. This consisted primarily of our capital expenditures of $256.8 million for manufacturing and computer equipment to support our ongoing business and expansion activities in China, Eastern Europe and India; and net cash of $216.1 million paid primarily for the acquisition of certain television assembly operations of Philips in Kwidzyn and the acquisition of VEM. Additionally, during the third quarter of fiscal year 2005, we entered into several agreements for investing purposes that resulted in cash disbursements of $30.2 million for long term notes receivable and other short term assets. These expenditures and disbursements were offset by $14.4 million of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment. Net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year 2005 was $60.9 million. This resulted from $117.7 million in borrowings under debt agreements and $50.3 million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under option plans and employee stock purchase plans. These cash proceeds were partially offset by $102.5 million of payments toward debt agreements and capital lease obligations, and a $4.6 million payment upon the termination of our interest rate swap agreement. During fiscal year 2005, we borrowed 400.0 million Indian rupees and 17.9 million Euros (approximately $9.1 million and $22.1 million, respectively, based on currency exchange rates at August 31, 2005) under new debt agreements, as discussed below. In March 2005 we borrowed $80.0 million under our then existing unsecured revolving credit facility to partially fund the acquisition of VEM. This borrowing was repaid in full prior to May 31, 2005. In December 2004 we entered into a $6.4 million short term borrowing agreement, based on currency exchange rates at the borrowing date, for a Polish subsidiary with a Polish bank. This short term borrowing was repaid in full prior to February 28, 2005. Payments toward debt agreements also included approximately $15.4 million, based on currency exchange rates at the payment dates, to extinguish the outstanding balance of our five year term loan for a Japanese subsidiary with a Japanese bank. See Note 5 Notes Payable, Long Term Debt and Long Term Lease Obligations and Note 8 Stockholders Equity to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We may need to finance future growth and any corresponding working capital needs with additional borrowings under our revolving credit facilities described below, as well as additional public and private offerings of our debt and equity. During the first quarter of fiscal year 1999, we filed a $750.0 million shelf registration statement with the SEC registering the potential sale of debt and equity securities in the future, from time to time, to augment our liquidity and capital resources. In June 2000, we sold 13.0 million shares of our common stock pursuant to our shelf registration statement, which generated 32 Table of Contents net proceeds of $525.4 million. In August 2000, we increased the amount of securities available to be issued under a shelf registration statement to $1.5 billion. In May 2001, we issued a total of $345.0 million, 20 year, 1.75% convertible subordinated notes (the Convertible Notes) at par, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $337.5 million. The Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to our shelf registration statement. The Convertible Notes were to mature on May 15, 2021 and paid interest semiannually on May 15 and November 15. Under the terms of the Convertible Notes, the Note holders had the right to require us to purchase all or a portion of their Convertible Notes on May 15 in the years 2004, 2006, 2009 and 2014 at par plus accrued interest. Additionally, we had the right to redeem all or a portion of the Convertible Notes for cash at any time on or after May 18, 2004. On May 17, 2004, we paid $70.4 million par value to certain note holders who exercised their right to require us to purchase their Convertible Notes. On May 18, 2004, we paid $274.6 million par value upon exercise of our right to redeem the remaining Convertible Notes outstanding. In addition to the par value of the Convertible Notes, we paid accrued and unpaid interest of approximately $3.1 million to the note holders. As a result of these transactions, we recognized a loss of $6.4 million on the write off of unamortized issuance costs associated with the Convertible Notes. This loss was recorded as an other loss in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2004. In July 2003, we issued a total of $300.0 million, seven year, 5.875% senior notes (5.875% Senior Notes) at 99.803% of par, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $297.2 million. The 5.875% Senior Notes were offered pursuant to our shelf registration statement. The 5.875% Senior Notes mature on July 15, 2010 and pay interest semiannually on January 15 and July 15. Approximately $855.0 million of securities remain registered with the SEC under our shelf registration statement at August 31, 2005. The Securities Act of 1933 (the Act) Offering Reform, which will go into effect on December 1, 2005, will significantly modify the registration and offering process under the Act. Based on the new registration and offering regime, we may file a new shelf registration statement to replace the existing shelf. Under the new rules, we anticipate that Jabil will be classified as a well known seasoned issuer, thereby allowing the Company to take advantage of the simplified registration procedures. At this time, the Company is still evaluating whether to file a new shelf registration statement. In the meantime, the Company may still issue securities under its existing shelf registration statement. In July 2003, we entered into an interest rate swap transaction to effectively convert the fixed interest rate of our 5.875% Senior Notes to a variable rate. The swap, which was to expire in 2010, was accounted for as a fair value hedge under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities (SFAS 133). The notional amount of the swap was $300.0 million, which is related to the 5.875% Senior Notes. Under the terms of the swap, we paid an interest rate equal to the six month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) rate, set in arrears, plus a fixed spread of 1.945%. In exchange, we received a fixed rate of 5.875%. The swap transaction qualified for the shortcut method of recognition under SFAS 133, therefore no portion of the swap was treated as ineffective. The interest rate swap was terminated on June 3, 2005. The fair value of the interest rate swap of $4.5 million was recorded in long term liabilities, with the corresponding offset recorded as a decrease to the carrying value of the 5.875% Senior Notes, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at the termination date. In addition, we had recorded $0.4 million of interest receivable from the issuing bank as of the termination date. Upon termination, Jabil made a net $4.1 million cash payment to the issuing bank to derecognize the interest rate swap and the accrued interest. The $4.5 million decrease to the carrying value of the 5.875% Senior Notes on the Consolidated Balance Sheet will be amortized to earnings through interest expense over the remaining term of the debt. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2003, we negotiated a six month, 1.8 billion Japanese yen (JPY) (approximately $15.2 million based on currency exchange rates at the time) credit facility for a Japanese subsidiary with a Japanese bank. Under the terms of the credit facility, interest accrued on outstanding borrowings based on the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (TIBOR) plus a spread of 1.75%. 33 Table of Contents The credit facility was to expire on December 2, 2003 and any outstanding borrowings would then be due and payable. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003, we borrowed 1.8 billion JPY on this facility. The cash proceeds, which translated to $15.2 million based on foreign currency rates in effect at the date of the borrowing, were used to partially fund the acquisition of certain operations of NEC in Gotemba, Japan. On August 28, 2003, we renegotiated the previously existing 1.8 billion JPY credit facility by converting it into a five year term loan (Japan Term Loan), with the final principal payment due May 31, 2008. We paid interest on the Japan Term Loan quarterly at a fixed annual rate of 2.97%. The Japan Term Loan required quarterly repayments of principal of 105 million JPY. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2005, the Company extinguished the outstanding balance of the Japan Term Loan. The Japan Term Loan required compliance with financial and operating covenants including maintaining a minimum equity balance at the respective subsidiary level. We were in compliance with the respective covenants through the date of extinguishment. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2004, we renewed our existing 0.6 billion Japanese yen (approximately $5.6 million based on currency exchange rates at August 31, 2005) credit facility for a Japanese subsidiary with a Japanese bank. Under the terms of the facility, we pay interest on outstanding borrowings based on the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread of 1.75%. The credit facility expires on December 2, 2005 and any outstanding borrowings are then due and payable. We currently anticipate that we will renew this facility in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006. At August 31, 2005, there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003, we amended and revised our then existing credit facility and established a three year, $400.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks (the Amended Revolver). Under the terms of the Amended Revolver, borrowings could be made under either floating rate loans or Eurodollar rate loans. Interest accrued on outstanding floating rate loans at the greater of the agents prime rate or 0.50% plus the federal funds rate. Interest accrued on outstanding Eurodollar loans at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) in effect at the loan inception plus a spread of 0.65% to 1.35%. A facility fee based on the committed amount of the Amended Revolver was payable at a rate equal to 0.225% to 0.40%. A usage fee was also payable if our borrowings on the Amended Revolver exceeded 331/3% of the aggregate commitment. The usage fee rate ranged from 0.125% to 0.25%. The interest spread, facility fee and usage fee were determined based on our general corporate rating or rating of our senior unsecured long term indebtedness as determined by Standard and Poors Rating Service (S&P) and Moodys Investor Service (Moodys). The Amended Revolver had an expiration date of July 14, 2006 when outstanding borrowings would then be due and payable. The Amended Revolver required compliance with several financial covenants including a fixed charge coverage ratio, consolidated net worth threshold and indebtedness to EBITDA ratio, as defined in the Amended Revolver. The Amended Revolver required compliance with certain operating covenants, which limited, among other things, our incurrence of additional indebtedness. On March 10, 2005, we borrowed $80.0 million under the Amended Revolver to partially fund the acquisition of VEM, which was consummated on March 11, 2005. This borrowing was repaid in full during the third quarter of fiscal year 2005 from cash provided by operations. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2005, we replaced the Amended Revolver and established a five year, $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks (the Unsecured Revolver). The Unsecured Revolver, which expires on May 11, 2010, may be increased to a maximum of $750.0 million at the request of the Company if approved by the lenders. Such requests must be for an increase of at least $50.0 million or an integral multiple thereof, and may only be made once per calendar year. Interest and fees on Unsecured Revolver advances are based on the Companys senior unsecured long term indebtedness rating as determined by S&P and Moodys. Interest is charged at either the base rate or a rate equal to 0.50% to 0.950% above the Eurocurrency rate, where the base rate, available for U.S. dollar advances only, represents the greater of the agents prime rate or 0.50% plus the federal funds rate, and the Eurocurrency rate represents the applicable LIBOR, each as more fully defined in the Unsecured Revolver. Fees include a facility fee based on the total commitments of the lenders, a letter of credit fee based on the amount of outstanding letters of credit, and a utilization fee to be added to the 34 Table of Contents interest rate and the letter of credit fee during any period when the aggregate amount of outstanding advances and letters of credit exceeds 50% of the total commitments of the lenders. Based on the Companys current senior unsecured long term indebtedness rating as determined by S&P and Moodys, the current rate of interest plus the applicable facility and utilization fee on a full Eurocurrency rate draw would be 1.00% above the Eurocurrency rate as defined above. Among other things, the Unsecured Revolver contains financial covenants establishing a debt to EBITDA ratio and interest coverage ratio; and contains operating covenants, which limit, among other things, our incurrence of indebtedness at the subsidiary level, and the incurrence of liens at all levels. The various covenants, limitations and events of default included in the Unsecured Revolver are currently customary for similar facilities for similarly rated borrowers. The Company was in compliance with the respective covenants at August 31, 2005. At August 31, 2005, there were no borrowings outstanding on the Unsecured Revolver. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2004, we entered into an asset backed securitization program with a bank, which originally provided for net cash proceeds at any one time of up to $100.0 million on the sale of eligible accounts receivable of certain domestic operations. As a result of an amendment in April 2004, the program was increased to up to $120.0 million of net cash proceeds at any one time. As a result of a second amendment in February 2005, the program was renewed and increased to up to $145.0 million of net cash proceeds at any one time. The program was increased to up to $175.0 million of net cash proceeds at any one time by a third amendment in May 2005. Under this agreement, we continuously sell a designated pool of trade accounts receivable to a wholly owned subsidiary, which in turn sells an ownership interest in the receivables to a conduit, administered by an unaffiliated financial institution. This wholly owned subsidiary is a separate bankruptcy remote entity and its assets would be available first to satisfy the claims of the conduit. As the receivables sold are collected, we are able to sell additional receivables up to the maximum permitted amount under the program. The securitization program requires compliance with several financial covenants including an interest coverage ratio and debt to EBITDA ratio, as defined in the securitization agreements, as amended. We were in compliance with the respective covenants at August 31, 2005. The securitization agreements, as amended, expire in February 2006 and may be extended on an annual basis. For each pool of eligible receivables sold to the conduit, we retain a percentage interest in the face value of the receivables, which is calculated based on the terms of the agreement. Net receivables sold under this program are excluded from accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are reflected as cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. We continue to service, administer and collect the receivables sold under this program. We pay facility fees of 0.30% per annum of the average purchase limit and program fees of up to 0.125% of outstanding amounts. The investors and the securitization conduit have no recourse to the Companys assets for failure of debtors to pay when due. As of August 31, 2005, we had sold $261.5 million of eligible accounts receivable, which represents the face amount of total outstanding receivables at that date. In exchange, we received cash proceeds of $175.0 million and retained an interest in the receivables of approximately $86.5 million. In connection with the securitization program, we recognized pretax losses on the sale of receivables of approximately $4.1 million and $0.8 million during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004, we negotiated a two year, $100.0 thousand credit facility for a Ukrainian subsidiary with a Ukrainian bank. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2005, this credit facility was increased to $600.0 thousand. However, $500.0 thousand of our availability under the facility has been restricted for specific purposes. Under the terms of the facility, we pay interest on outstanding borrowings based on LIBOR plus a spread of 1.5%. We also pay a commitment fee of 2.0% per annum for any capacity that is restricted but not outstanding under the facility. The credit facility expires on June 9, 2006 and any outstanding borrowings are then due and payable. At August 31, 2005, there was $97.0 thousand outstanding under this facility. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2005, we negotiated a five year, 400.0 million Indian rupee (approximately $9.1 million based on currency exchange rates at August 31, 2005) construction loan for an Indian subsidiary with an Indian bank. Under the terms of the loan facility, we pay interest on 35 Table of Contents outstanding borrowings based on a fixed rate of 7.45%. The construction loan expires on April 15, 2010 and all outstanding borrowings are then due and payable. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2005, we negotiated a five year, 25.0 million Euro construction loan for a Hungarian subsidiary with a Hungarian bank. Under the terms of the loan facility, we pay interest on outstanding borrowings based on the Euro Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread of 0.925%. Quarterly principal repayments begin in September 2006 to repay the amount of proceeds drawn under the construction loan. The construction loan expires on April 13, 2010. At August 31, 2005, proceeds of 17.9 million Euros (approximately $22.1 million based on currency exchange rates at August 31, 2005) had been drawn under the construction loan. At August 31, 2005, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash, cash equivalents, available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and our accounts receivable securitization program. Our working capital requirements and capital expenditures could continue to increase in order to support future expansions of our operations through construction of greenfield operations or acquisitions. It is possible that future expansions may be significant and may require the payment of cash. Future liquidity needs will also depend on fluctuations in levels of inventory and shipments, changes in customer order volumes and timing of expenditures for new equipment. We currently anticipate that during the next twelve months, our capital expenditures will be in the range of $250.0 million to $350.0 million, principally for machinery and equipment, and expansion in China and Eastern Europe. We also currently anticipate the need for an additional minimum of $204.0 million, subject to current negotiations, plus any additional potential earn out consideration for the exercise of the purchase option discussed in Note 12 Business Acquisitions and Other Transactions and Note 16 Subsequent Event to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that our level of resources, which include cash on hand, available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, additional proceeds available under our accounts receivable securitization program and funds provided by operations, will be adequate to fund these capital expenditures and our working capital requirements for the next twelve months. Should we desire to consummate significant additional acquisition opportunities or undertake significant additional expansion activities, our capital needs would increase and could possibly result in our need to increase available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities or access public or private debt and equity markets. There can be no assurance, however, that we would be successful in raising additional debt or equity on terms that we would consider acceptable. Our contractual obligations for short and long term debt arrangements and future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating lease arrangements as of August 31, 2005 are summarized below. We do not participate in, or secure financing for any unconsolidated limited purpose entities. We generally do not enter into non cancelable purchase orders for materials until we receive a corresponding purchase commitment from our customer. Non cancelable purchase orders do not typically extend beyond the normal lead time of several weeks at most. Purchase orders beyond this time frame are typically cancelable.

The ultimate correctness of those forward looking statements is dependent upon a number of known and unknown risks and events, and is subject to various uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be different from those expressed or implied by those statements. Undue reliance should not be placed on those forward looking statements. The following important factors, among others, as well as those factors set forth in our other SEC filings from time to time, could affect future results and events, causing results and events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward looking statements. Our operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our annual and quarterly operating results are affected by a number of factors, including: adverse changes in general economic conditions; the level and timing of customer orders; the level of capacity utilization of our manufacturing facilities and associated fixed costs; the composition of the costs of revenue between materials, labor and manufacturing overhead; price competition; our level of experience in manufacturing a particular product; the degree of automation used in our assembly process; the efficiencies achieved in managing inventories and fixed assets; fluctuations in materials costs and availability of materials; seasonality in customers product requirements; and the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales, customer product delivery requirements and shortages of components or labor. The volume and timing of orders placed by our customers vary due to variation in demand for our customers products; our customers attempts to manage their inventory; electronic design changes; changes in our customers manufacturing strategies; and acquisitions of or consolidations among our customers. In the past, changes in customer orders have had a significant effect on our results of operations due to corresponding changes in the level of our overhead absorption. Any one or a combination of these factors could adversely affect our annual and quarterly results of operations in the future. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Quarterly Results. Because we depend on a limited number of customers, a reduction in sales to any one of our customers could cause a significant decline in our revenue. For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2005, our five largest customers accounted for approximately 50% of our net revenue and 40 customers accounted for approximately 90% of our net revenue. For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2005, Philips, Nokia and HP accounted for approximately 14%, 13% and 10% of our net revenue, respectively. We expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue and upon their growth, viability and financial stability. Our customers industries have experienced rapid technological change, shortening of product life cycles, consolidation, and pricing and margin pressures. Consolidation among our customers may further reduce the number of customers that generate a significant percentage of our revenues and exposes us to increased risks relating to dependence on a small number of customers. A significant reduction in sales to any of our customers or a customer exerting significant pricing and margin pressures on us would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In the past, some of our customers have terminated 37 Table of Contents their manufacturing arrangements with us or have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of design, production, product management or repair services ordered from us. Our industrys revenue declined in mid 2001 as a result of significant cut backs in customer production requirements, which was consistent with the overall global economic downturn. We cannot assure you that present or future customers will not terminate their design, production, product management and repair services arrangements with us or significantly change, reduce or delay the amount of services ordered from us. If they do, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, we generate significant account receivables in connection with providing design, production, product management and repair services to our customers. If one or more of our customers were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay for the services provided by us, our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Business Customers and Marketing. Consolidation in industries that utilize electronics components may adversely affect our business. In the current economic climate, consolidation in industries that utilize electronics components may further increase as companies combine to achieve further economies of scale and other synergies. Consolidation in industries that utilize electronics components could result in an increase in excess manufacturing capacity as companies seek to divest manufacturing operations or eliminate duplicative product lines. Excess manufacturing capacity has increased, and may continue to increase, pricing and competitive pressures for our industry as a whole and for us in particular. Consolidation could also result in an increasing number of very large companies offering products in multiple industries. The significant purchasing power and market power of these large companies could increase pricing and competitive pressures for us. If one of our customers is acquired by another company that does not rely on us to provide services and has its own production facilities or relies on another provider of similar services, we may lose that customers business. Such consolidation among our customers may further reduce the number of customers that generate a significant percentage of our revenues and exposes us to increased risks relating to dependence on a small number of customers. Any of the foregoing results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business. Our customers may be adversely affected by rapid technological change. Our customers compete in markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and continuous improvements in products and services. These conditions frequently result in short product life cycles. Our success will depend largely on the success achieved by our customers in developing and marketing their products. If technologies or standards supported by our customers products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance, our business could be materially adversely affected. We depend on industries that utilize electronics components, which continually produces technologically advanced products with short life cycles; our inability to continually manufacture such products on a cost effective basis would harm our business. Factors affecting the industries that utilize electronics components in general could seriously harm our customers and, as a result, us. These factors include: The inability of our customers to adapt to rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards, which result in short product life cycles. The inability of our customers to develop and market their products, some of which are new and untested, the potential that our customers products may become obsolete or the failure of our customers products to gain widespread commercial acceptance. Recessionary periods in our customers markets. If any of these factors materialize, our business would suffer. 38 Table of Contents In addition, if we are unable to offer technologically advanced, cost effective, quick response manufacturing services to customers, demand for our services will also decline. A substantial portion of our net revenue is derived from our offering of complete service solutions for our customers. For example, if we fail to maintain high quality design and engineering services, our net revenue may significantly decline. Most of our customers do not commit to long term production schedules, which makes it difficult for us to schedule production and achieve maximum efficiency of our manufacturing capacity. The volume and timing of sales to our customers may vary due to: variation in demand for our customers products; our customers attempts to manage their inventory; electronic design changes; changes in our customers manufacturing strategy; and acquisitions of or consolidations among customers. Due in part to these factors, most of our customers do not commit to firm production schedules for more than one quarter in advance. Our inability to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity. In the past, we have been required to increase staffing and other expenses in order to meet the anticipated demand of our customers. Anticipated orders from many of our customers have, in the past, failed to materialize or delivery schedules have been deferred as a result of changes in our customers business needs, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations. On other occasions, our customers have required rapid increases in production, which have placed an excessive burden on our resources. Such customer order fluctuations and deferrals have had a material adverse effect on us in the past, and we may experience such effects in the future. A business downturn resulting from any of these external factors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Business Backlog. Our customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or delay production. Our industry must provide increasingly rapid product turnaround for its customers. We generally do not obtain firm, long term purchase commitments from our customers and we continue to experience reduced lead times in customer orders. Customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or delay production for a number of reasons. The success of our customers products in the market affects our business. Cancellations, reductions or delay by a significant customer or by a group of customers could negatively impact our operating results. In addition, we make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, personnel needs and other resource requirements, based on our estimate of customer requirements. The short term nature of our customers commitments and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products reduces our ability to accurately estimate the future requirements of those customers. On occasion, customers may require rapid increases in production, which can stress our resources and reduce operating margins. In addition, because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand can harm our gross profits and operating results. We compete with numerous other electronic manufacturing services and design providers and others, including our current and potential customers who may decide to manufacture all of their products internally. Our business is highly competitive. We compete against numerous domestic and foreign electronic manufacturing services and design providers, including Celestica, Inc., Flextronics International, Hon Hai 39 Table of Contents Precision Industry Co., Ltd., Sanmina SCI Corporation and Solectron Corporation. In addition, we may in the future encounter competition from other large electronic manufacturers and manufacturers that are focused solely on design and manufacturing services, that are selling, or may begin to sell the same services. Most of our competitors have international operations, significant financial resources and some have substantially greater manufacturing, R&D, and marketing resources than us. These competitors may: respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies; have greater name recognition, critical mass and geographic market presence; be better able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities; adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements; devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their services; and be better positioned to compete on price for their services. We also face competition from the manufacturing operations of our current and potential customers, who are continually evaluating the merits of manufacturing products internally against the advantages of outsourcing. See Business Competition. Increased competition may result in decreased demand or prices for our services. Because our industry is highly competitive, we compete against numerous U.S. and foreign electronic manufacturing service providers with global operations, as well as those who operate on a local or regional basis. In addition, current and prospective customers continually evaluate the merits of manufacturing products internally. Some of our competitors have substantially greater managerial, manufacturing, engineering, technical, systems, R&D, sales and marketing resources than we do. Consolidation in our industry results in larger and more geographically diverse competitors who have significant combined resources with which to compete against us. We may be operating at a cost disadvantage compared to competitors who have greater direct buying power from component suppliers, distributors and raw material suppliers or who have lower cost structures as a result of their geographic location or the services they provide. As a result, competitors may procure a competitive advantage and obtain business from our customers. Our manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant proprietary protection. In addition, companies with greater resources or a greater market presence may enter our market or increase their competition with us. We also expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products or services, to reduce their current products or service sales prices and to introduce new products or services that may offer greater performance and improved pricing. Any of these could cause a decline in sales, loss of market acceptance of our products or services, profit margin compression, or loss of market share. We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our international operations, which may be subject to a number of risks and often require more management time and expense to achieve profitability than our domestic operations. We derived 83.8% of revenues from international operations in fiscal year 2005 compared to 84.6% in fiscal year 2004. We expect our revenues from international operations to increase as a percentage of total net revenue due to expansion in China, Eastern Europe and India, and due to the continued shift of production to lower cost regions. We currently operate outside the United States in Vienna, Austria; Bruges and Hasselt, Belgium; Belo Horizonte, Manaus and Sao Paulo, Brazil; Hong Kong, Huangpu, Panyu, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Wuxi, China; Coventry, England; Brest and Meung sur Loire, France; Szombathely and Tiszaujvaros, Hungary; Pune and Ranjangaon, India; Dublin, Ireland; Bergamo and Marcianise, Italy; Gotemba, Japan; Penang, Malaysia; Chihuahua, Guadalajara and Reynosa, Mexico; Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Kwidzyn, Poland; Ayr and Livingston, Scotland; Singapore City, Singapore; Hsinchu, Taiwan; and Uzhgorod, Ukraine. We continually consider additional opportunities to make 40 Table of Contents foreign acquisitions and construct new foreign facilities. Our international operations may be subject to a number of risks, including: difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; political and economic instability; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and laws; longer customer payment cycles and difficulty collecting accounts receivable export duties, import controls and trade barriers (including quotas); governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to us from our operations outside the United States; burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and labor practices; fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could affect local payroll, utility and other expenses; and inability to utilize net operating losses incurred by our foreign operations against future income in the same jurisdiction. In addition, several of the countries where we operate have emerging or developing economies, which may be subject to greater currency volatility, negative growth, high inflation, limited availability of foreign exchange and other risks. These factors may harm our results of operations, and any measures that we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies and other risks of our international operations may not be effective. In our experience, entry into new international markets requires considerable management time as well as start up expenses for market development, hiring and establishing office facilities before any significant revenues are generated. As a result, initial operations in a new market may operate at low margins or may be unprofitable. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources. If we do not manage our growth effectively, our profitability could decline. We have grown rapidly. Our ability to manage growth effectively will require us to continue to implement and improve our operational, financial and management information systems; continue to develop the management skills of our managers and supervisors; and continue to train, motivate and manage our employees. Our failure to effectively manage growth could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See Selected Consolidated Financial Data and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We may not achieve expected profitability from our acquisitions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate the operations and management of our recent acquisitions. Similarly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate or, if consummated, successfully integrate the operations and management of future acquisitions. Acquisitions involve significant risks, which could have a material adverse effect on us, including: Financial risks, such as (1) potential liabilities of the acquired businesses; (2) costs associated with integrating acquired operations and businesses; (3) the dilutive effect of the issuance of additional equity securities; (4) the incurrence of additional debt; (5) the financial impact of valuing goodwill and other intangible assets involved in any acquisitions, potential future impairment write downs of goodwill and the amortization of other intangible assets; (6) possible adverse tax and accounting effects; and (7) the risk that we spend substantial amounts purchasing these manufacturing facilities and assume significant contractual and other obligations with no guaranteed levels of revenue or that we may have to close facilities at our cost. 41 Table of Contents Operating risks, such as (1) the diversion of managements attention to the assimilation of the businesses to be acquired; (2) the risk that the acquired businesses will fail to maintain the quality of services that we have historically provided; (3) the need to implement financial and other systems and add management resources; (4) the risk that key employees of the acquired businesses will leave after the acquisition; (5) unforeseen difficulties in the acquired operations; and (6) the impact on us of any unionized work force we may acquire or any labor disruptions that might occur. We have acquired and will continue to pursue the acquisition of manufacturing and supply chain management operations. In these acquisitions, the divesting company will typically enter into a supply arrangement with the acquiror. Therefore, the competition for these acquisitions is intense. In addition, certain divesting companies may choose not to consummate these acquisitions with us because of our current supply arrangements with other companies. If we are unable to attract and consummate some of these acquisition opportunities, our growth could be adversely impacted. Arrangements entered into with divesting companies typically involve many risks, including the following: The integration into our business of the acquired assets and facilities may be time consuming and costly. We, rather than the divesting company, may bear the risk of excess capacity. We may not achieve anticipated cost reductions and efficiencies. We may be unable to meet the expectations of the divesting company as to volume, product quality, timeliness and cost reductions. If demand for the divesting companys products declines, it may reduce the volume of purchases and we may not be able to sufficiently reduce the expenses of operating the facility or use the facility to provide services to other customers. As a result of these and other risks, we may be unable to achieve anticipated levels of profitability under these arrangements, and they may not result in any material revenues or contribute positively to our earnings. Our ability to achieve the expected benefits of the outsourcing opportunities associated with these acquisitions is subject to risks, including our ability to meet volume, product quality, timeliness and pricing requirements, and our ability to achieve the divesting companys expected cost reduction. In addition, when acquiring manufacturing operations, we may receive limited commitments to firm production schedules. Accordingly, in these circumstances, we may spend substantial amounts purchasing these manufacturing facilities and assume significant contractual and other obligations with no guaranteed levels of revenues. We may also not achieve expected profitability from these arrangements. As a result of these and other risks, these outsourcing opportunities may not be profitable. We face risks arising from the restructuring of our operations. Over the past few years, we have undertaken initiatives to restructure our business operations with the intention of improving utilization and realizing cost savings in the future. These initiatives have included changing the number and location of our production facilities, largely to align our capacity and infrastructure with current and anticipated customer demand. This alignment includes transferring programs from higher cost geographies to lower cost geographies. The process of restructuring entails, among other activities, moving production between facilities, reducing staff levels, realigning our business processes and reorganizing our management. We continue to evaluate our operations and may need to undertake additional restructuring initiatives in the future. If we incur additional restructuring related charges, our financial condition and results of operations may suffer. 42 Table of Contents We depend on a limited number of suppliers for components that are critical to our manufacturing processes. A shortage of these components or an increase in their price could interrupt our operations and reduce our profits. Substantially all of our net revenue is derived from turnkey manufacturing in which we provide materials procurement. While most of our significant long term customer contracts permit quarterly or other periodic adjustments to pricing based on decreases and increases in component prices and other factors, we may bear the risk of component price increases that occur between any such re pricings or, if such re pricing is not permitted, during the balance of the term of the particular customer contract. Accordingly, certain component price increases could adversely affect our gross profit margins. Almost all of the products we manufacture require one or more components that are available from only a single source. Some of these components are allocated from time to time in response to supply shortages. In some cases, supply shortages will substantially curtail production of all assemblies using a particular component. In addition, at various times industry wide shortages of electronic components have occurred, particularly of memory and logic devices. Such circumstances have produced insignificant levels of short term interruption of our operations, but could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the future. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Business Components Procurement. We may not be able to maintain our engineering, technological and manufacturing process expertise. The markets for our manufacturing and engineering services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving process development. The continued success of our business will depend upon our ability to: hire, retain and expand our qualified engineering and technical personnel; maintain technological leadership; develop and market manufacturing services that meet changing customer needs; and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes on a cost effective and timely basis. Although we believe that our operations use the assembly and testing technologies, equipment and processes that are currently required by our customers, we cannot be certain that we will develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future. The emergence of new technology, industry standards or customer requirements may render our equipment, inventory or processes obsolete or noncompetitive. In addition, we may have to acquire new assembly and testing technologies and equipment to remain competitive. The acquisition and implementation of new technologies and equipment may require significant expense or capital investment, which could reduce our operating margins and our operating results. In facilities that we establish or acquire, we may not be able to maintain our engineering, technological and manufacturing process expertise. Our failure to anticipate and adapt to our customers changing technological needs and requirements or to maintain our engineering, technological and manufacturing expertise, could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we manufacture products containing design or manufacturing defects, or if our manufacturing processes do not comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, demand for our services may decline and we may be subject to liability claims. We manufacture and design products to our customers specifications, and, in some cases, our manufacturing processes and facilities may need to comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. For example, medical devices that we manufacture or design, as well as the facilities and manufacturing processes that we use to produce them, are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration and non US counterparts of this agency. Similarly, items we manufacture for customers in the defense and aerospace industries, as well as the processes we use to produce them, are regulated by the Department of Defense and the Federal Aviation Authority. In addition, our customers products and the manufacturing 43 Table of Contents processes that we use to produce them often are highly complex. As a result, products that we manufacture may at times contain manufacturing or design defects, and our manufacturing processes may be subject to errors or not be in compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. Defects in the products we manufacture or design, whether caused by a design, manufacturing or component failure or error, or deficiencies in our manufacturing processes, may result in delayed shipments to customers or reduced or cancelled customer orders. If these defects or deficiencies are significant, our business reputation may also be damaged. The failure of the products that we manufacture or our manufacturing processes and facilities to comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements may subject us to legal fines or penalties and, in some cases, require us to shut down or incur considerable expense to correct a manufacturing process or facility. In addition, these defects may result in liability claims against us or expose us to liability to pay for the recall of a product. The magnitude of such claims may increase as we expand our medical, automotive, and aerospace and defense manufacturing services, as defects in medical devices, automotive components, and aerospace and defense systems could seriously harm or kill users of these products and others. Even if our customers are responsible for the defects, they may not, or may not have resources to, assume responsibility for any costs or liabilities arising from these defects. Our increasing design services offerings may result in additional exposure to product liability, intellectual property infringement and other claims. We have increased our efforts to offer certain design services, primarily those relating to products that we manufacture for our customers, and we now offer design services related to collaborative design manufacturing and turnkey solutions. Providing such services can expose us to different or greater potential liabilities than those we face when providing our regular manufacturing services. With the growth of our design services business, we have increased exposure to potential product liability claims resulting from injuries caused by defects in products we design, as well as potential claims that products we design infringe third party intellectual property rights. Such claims could subject us to significant liability for damages and, regardless of their merits, could be time consuming and expensive to resolve. We also may have greater potential exposure from warranty claims, and from product recalls due to problems caused by product design. Costs associated with possible product liability claims, intellectual property infringement claims, and product recalls could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. When providing collaborative design manufacturing or turnkey solutions, we may not be guaranteed revenues needed to recoup or profit from the investment in the resources necessary to design and develop products. Particularly, no revenue may be generated from these efforts if our customers do not approve the designs in a timely manner or at all, or if they do not then purchase anticipated levels of products. Furthermore, contracts may allow the customer to delay or cancel deliveries and may not obligate the customer to any volume of purchases, or may provide for penalties or cancellation of orders if we are late in delivering designs or products. We may even have the responsibility to ensure that products we design satisfy safety and regulatory standards and to obtain any necessary certifications. Failure to timely obtain the necessary approvals or certifications could prevent us from selling these products, which in turn could harm our sales, profitability and reputation. The success of our turnkey activity depends in part on our ability to obtain, protect, and leverage intellectual property rights to our designs. We strive to obtain and protect certain intellectual property rights to our turnkey solutions designs. We believe that having a significant level of protected proprietary technology gives us a competitive advantage in marketing our services. However, we cannot be certain that the measures that we employ will result in protected intellectual property rights or will result in the prevention of unauthorized use of our technology. If we are unable to obtain and protect intellectual property rights embodied within our designs, this could reduce or eliminate the competitive advantages of our proprietary technology, which would harm our business. 44 Table of Contents Intellectual property infringement claims against our customers or us could harm our business. Our turnkey solutions products may compete against the products of other companies, many of whom may own the intellectual property rights underlying those products. As a result, we could become subject to claims of intellectual property infringement. Additionally, customers for our turnkey solutions services typically require that we indemnify them against the risk of intellectual property infringement. If any claims are brought against us or against our customers for such infringement, whether or not these claims have merit, we could be required to expend significant resources in defense of such claims. In the event of such an infringement claim, we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop non infringing alternatives or obtain licenses. We may not be successful in developing such alternatives or obtaining such a license on reasonable terms or at all. If our turnkey solutions products are subject to design defects, our business may be damaged and we may incur significant fees. In our contracts with turnkey solutions customers, we generally provide them with a warranty against defects in our designs. If a turnkey solutions product or component that we design is found to be defective in its design, this may lead to increased warranty claims. Although we have product liability insurance coverage, it may not be available on acceptable terms, in sufficient amounts, or at all. A successful product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage or any material claim for which insurance coverage was denied or limited and for which indemnification was not available could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We depend on our officers, managers and skilled personnel. Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our executive officers. Generally our employees are not bound by employment or non competition agreements, and we cannot assure you that we will retain our executive officers and other key employees. We could be seriously harmed by the loss of any of our executive officers. In order to manage our growth, we will need to recruit and retain additional skilled management personnel and if we are not able to do so, our business and our ability to continue to grow could be harmed. In addition, in connection with expanding our turnkey solutions activities, we must attract and retain experienced design engineers. Competition for highly skilled employees is substantial. Our failure to recruit and retain experienced design engineers could limit the growth of our turnkey solutions activities, which could adversely affect our business. Any delay in the implementation of our information systems could disrupt our operations and cause unanticipated increases in our costs. We have completed the installation of an Enterprise Resource Planning system in most of our manufacturing sites and in our corporate location. We are in the process of installing this system in certain of our remaining plants, which will replace the current Manufacturing Resource Planning system, and financial information systems. Any delay in the implementation of these information systems could result in material adverse consequences, including disruption of operations, loss of information and unanticipated increases in cost. Compliance or the failure to comply with current and future environmental regulations could cause us significant expense. We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process or requiring design changes or recycling of products we manufacture. If we fail to comply with any present and future regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities, the suspension of production or a prohibition on the sale of products we manufacture. In addition, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment, or to incur other significant 45 Table of Contents expenses to comply with environmental regulations, including expenses associated with the recall of any non compliant product. From time to time new regulations are enacted, and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations will be implemented and enforced. We continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted. For example, in 2003 the European Union enacted the Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (RoHS) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE), for implementation in European Union member states. RoHS and WEEE regulate the use of certain hazardous substances in, and require the collection, reuse and recycling of waste from certain products we manufacture. We are aware of similar legislation that is currently in force or is being considered in the United States, as well as other countries, such as Japan and China. RoHS and WEEE are in the process of being implemented by individual countries in the European Union. It is likely that each jurisdiction will interpret RoHS and WEEE differently as they each implement them. We will continue to monitor RoHS and WEEE guidance as it is announced by individual jurisdictions to determine our responsibilities. The incomplete guidance available to us to date suggests that in many instances we will not be directly responsible for compliance with RoHS and WEEE, but that such regulations will likely apply directly to our customers. However, because we manufacture the products and may provide design and or compliance related services for our customers, we may at times become contractually or directly subject to such regulations. Also, final guidance from individual jurisdictions may impose different or additional responsibilities upon us. Our failure to comply with any of such regulatory requirements or contractual obligations could result in our being directly or indirectly liable for costs, fines or penalties and third party claims, and could jeopardize our ability to conduct business in countries in the European Union. Certain of our existing stockholders have significant control. At August 31, 2005, our executive officers, directors and certain of their family members collectively beneficially owned 15.3% of our outstanding common stock, of which William D. Morean, our Chairman of the Board, beneficially owned 9.3%. As a result, our executive officers, directors and certain of their family members have significant influence over (1) the election of our Board of Directors, (2) the approval or disapproval of any other matters requiring stockholder approval, and (3) the affairs and policies of Jabil. We are subject to the risk of increased taxes. We base our tax position upon the anticipated nature and conduct of our business and upon our understanding of the tax laws of the various countries in which we have assets or conduct activities. Our tax position, however, is subject to review and possible challenge by taxing authorities and to possible changes in law. We cannot determine in advance the extent to which some jurisdictions may assess additional tax or interest and penalties on such additional taxes. Several countries in which we are located allow for tax holidays or provide other tax incentives to attract and retain business. We have obtained holidays or other incentives where available and practicable. Our taxes could increase if certain tax holidays or incentives are retracted, or if they are not renewed upon expiration, or tax rates applicable to us in such jurisdictions are otherwise increased. In addition, further acquisitions may cause our effective tax rate to increase. Our credit rating is subject to change. Our credit is rated by credit rating agencies. For example, our 5.875% Senior Notes are rated BBB by Fitch Ratings, Baa3 by Moodys Investor Service, and BBB by Standard and Poors Rating Service, which are all considered investment grade debt. If in the future our credit rating is downgraded so that none of the credit rating agencies rate our 5.875% Senior Notes as investment grade debt, such a downgrade may increase our cost of capital should we borrow under our revolving credit facilities. 46 Table of Contents Additionally, a downgrade of our credit rating with one or more of the credit rating agencies may make it more expensive for us to raise additional capital in the future on terms that are acceptable to us or at all; may negatively impact the price of our common stock; and may have other negative implications on our business, many of which are beyond our control. We are subject to risks of currency fluctuations and related hedging operations. A portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates among other currencies and the U.S. dollar will affect our cost of sales, operating margins and revenues. We cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations. We use financial instruments, primarily forward purchase contracts, to hedge U.S. dollar and other currency commitments arising from trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable and fixed purchase obligations. If these hedging activities are not successful or we change or reduce these hedging activities in the future, we may experience significant unexpected expenses from fluctuations in exchange rates. We could incur a significant amount of debt in the future. We currently have the ability to borrow up to $500.0 million under our Unsecured Revolver. In addition, we could incur additional indebtedness in the future in the form of bank loans, notes or convertible securities. An increase in the level of our indebtedness, among other things, could: make it difficult for us to obtain any necessary financing in the future for other acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in, our business; and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet future debt service obligations. An adverse change in the interest rates for our borrowings could adversely affect our financial condition. We pay interest on outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and other long term debt obligations at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base interest rates. An adverse change in the base rates upon which our interest rates are determined could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We are exposed to intangible asset risk. We have recorded intangible assets, including goodwill, in connection with business acquisitions. We are required to perform goodwill impairment tests at least on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows. As a result of our annual and other periodic evaluations, we may determine that the intangible asset values need to be written down to their fair values, which could result in material charges that could be adverse to our operating results and financial position. Customer relationships with emerging companies may present more risks than with established companies. Customer relationships with emerging companies present special risks because such companies do not have an extensive product history. As a result, there is less demonstration of market acceptance of their products making it harder for us to anticipate needs and requirements than with established customers. In addition, due to the current economic environment, additional funding for such companies may be more difficult to obtain and these customer relationships may not continue or materialize to the extent we planned or we previously experienced. This tightening of financing for start up customers, together with many start up customers lack of prior earnings and unproven product markets increase our credit risk, especially in accounts receivable and inventories. Although we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our 47 Table of Contents customers and adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for all customers, including start up customers, based on the information available, these allowances may not be adequate. This risk exists for any new emerging company customers in the future. Our stock price may be volatile. Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and could fluctuate substantially in the future, based on a variety of factors, including future announcements covering us or our key customers or competitors, government regulations, litigation, changes in earnings estimates by analysts, fluctuations in quarterly operating results, or general conditions in our industry and the aerospace, automotive, computing, consumer, defense, instrumentation, medical, networking, peripherals, storage and telecommunications industries. Furthermore, stock prices for many companies, and high technology companies in particular, fluctuate widely for reasons that may be unrelated to their operating results. Those fluctuations and general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions or international currency fluctuations and demand for our services, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Provisions in our charter documents and state law may make it harder for others to obtain control of us even though some shareholders might consider such a development to be favorable. Our shareholder rights plan, provisions of our amended certificate of incorporation and the Delaware Corporation Laws may delay, inhibit or prevent someone from gaining control of us through a tender offer, business combination, proxy contest or some other method. These provisions include: a poison pill shareholder rights plan; a statutory restriction on the ability of shareholders to take action by less than unanimous written consent; and a statutory restriction on business combinations with some types of interested shareholders. Recently enacted changes in the securities laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs. The Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 that became law in July 2002 has required changes in some of our corporate governance, securities disclosure and compliance practices. In response to the requirements of that Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange have promulgated new rules on a variety of subjects. Compliance with these new rules has increased our legal and financial and accounting costs, and we expect these increased costs to continue indefinitely. We also expect these developments to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. Likewise, these developments may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors or qualified executive officers. Due to inherent limitations, there can be no assurance that our system of disclosure and internal controls and procedures will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud, or in informing management of all material information in timely manner. Our management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system reflects that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur simply because of 48 Table of Contents error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected. If we receive other than an unqualified opinion on the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2006 and future year ends as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could result in a decrease in the value of your shares. As directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted rules requiring public companies to include an annual report on internal control over financial reporting reports on Form 10 K that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting. In addition, the public accounting firm auditing the companys financial statements must attest to and report on managements assessment of the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting. While we continuously conduct a rigorous review of our internal control over financial reporting in order to assure compliance with the Section 404 requirements, if our independent auditors interpret the Section 404 requirements and the related rules and regulations differently from us or if our independent auditors are not satisfied with our internal control over financial reporting or with the level at which it is documented, operated or reviewed, they may decline to attest to managements assessment or issue a qualified report. A qualified opinion could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. There are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with US GAAP. Any changes in estimates, judgments and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. The consolidated and condensed consolidated financial statements included in the periodic reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (US GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in accordance with US GAAP involves making estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets (including intangible assets), liabilities and related reserves, revenues, expenses and income. Estimates, judgments and assumptions are inherently subject to change in the future, and any such changes could result in corresponding changes to the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and income. Any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Changes to financial accounting standards may affect our reported results of operations and could result in a decrease in the value of your shares. There has been an ongoing public debate as to whether employee stock option and employee stock purchase plan shares should be treated as a compensation expense and, if so, how to properly value such charges. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board published amendments to financial accounting standards that will require that awards under such plans be treated as compensation expense using the fair value method. This amendment will be effective for our first quarter of fiscal year 2006. Management has assessed the implications of this revised standard, which will materially impact the Companys results of operations in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 and thereafter. For discussion of our employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans, see Note 1(m) Description of Business and 49 Table of Contents Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Stock Based Compensation; Note 8 Stockholders Equity; and Note 15 New Accounting Pronouncements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Currency Exchange Risks We transact business in various foreign countries and are, therefore, subject to risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We enter into forward contracts to hedge transactional exposure associated with commitments arising from trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable and fixed purchase obligations denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective operating entity. All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their respective fair market values in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended (SFAS 133). The aggregate notional amount of outstanding contracts at August 31, 2005 was $148.0 million. The fair value of these contracts amounted to $0.2 million and was recorded as a net liability on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The forward contracts will generally expire in less than three months, with four months being the maximum term of the contracts outstanding at August 31, 2005. The forward contracts will settle in British pounds, Euro dollars, Hong Kong dollars, Hungarian forints, Japanese yen, Mexican pesos, Polish zloty, Singapore dollars, Swedish krona, and U.S. dollars. Interest Rate Risk A portion of our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio. We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. We place cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions. We protect our invested principal funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk. We mitigate default risk by generally investing in investment grade securities and by frequently positioning the portfolio to try to respond appropriately to a reduction in credit rating of any investment issuer, guarantor or depository to levels below the credit ratings dictated by our investment policy. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. At August 31, 2005, the outstanding amount in the investment portfolio was $10.3 million, comprised mainly of money market funds with an average return of 3.17%. We have issued our Senior Notes with a principal maturity of $300.0 million due in July 2010. The Senior Notes bear a fixed interest rate of 5.875%, which is payable semiannually on January 15 and July 15. We entered into an interest rate swap transaction to effectively convert the fixed interest rate of the 5.875% Senior Notes to a variable rate. The swap, which was originally to expire in 2010, was accounted for as a fair value hedge under SFAS 133. The notional amount of the swap was $300.0 million. Under the terms of the swap, we paid an interest rate equal to the six month LIBOR rate, set in arrears, plus a fixed spread of 1.945%. In exchange, we received a payment based on a fixed rate of 5.875%. The interest rate swap was terminated on June 3, 2005. For the periods subsequent to the termination date, interest on the Senior Notes will not fluctuate based on changes in the base interest rate. Therefore our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates related to the Senior Notes has been eliminated. We pay interest on outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facilities at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base interest rates. These facilities include our Unsecured Revolver, our 0.6 billion Japanese yen credit facility and our $600.0 thousand Ukrainian credit facility. There was $0.1 million outstanding under these revolving credit facilities at August 31, 2005. We pay interest on outstanding borrowings under our 25.0 million Euro loan agreement for a Hungarian subsidiary at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base interest rates. There was 17.9 million Euros (approximately $22.1 million based on currency exchange rates at August 31, 2005) outstanding under this loan agreement at August 31, 2005. 50 Table of Contents See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Risk Factors We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our international operations, which may be subject to a number of risks and often require more management time and expense to achieve profitability than our domestic operations, and An adverse change in the interest rates for our borrowings could adversely affect our financial condition.
