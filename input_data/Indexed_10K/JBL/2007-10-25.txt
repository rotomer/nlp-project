All forward looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified by these cautionary statements. Overview We are one of the leading providers of worldwide electronic manufacturing services and solutions. We provide comprehensive electronics design, production, product management and after market services to companies in the aerospace, automotive, computing, consumer, defense, industrial, instrumentation, medical, networking, peripherals, storage and telecommunications industries. The industry in which we operate is composed of companies that provide a range of manufacturing and design services to companies that utilize electronics components in their products. The industry experienced rapid change and growth through the 1990s as an increasing number of companies chose to outsource an increasing portion, and, in some cases, all of their manufacturing requirements. In mid 2001, the industrys revenue declined as a result of significant cut backs in customer production requirements, which was consistent with the overall global economic downturn at the time. In response to this industry and global economic downturn, we implemented a restructuring program to reduce our cost structure and further align our manufacturing capacity with the geographic production demands of our customers. During the third quarter of our 2001 fiscal year, we implemented a restructuring program to reduce our cost structure due to the global economic downturn. This restructuring program included reductions in workforce, re sizing of facilities and the transition of certain facilities into new customer development sites. The macroeconomic conditions for us, and the electronic manufacturing services industry as a whole, continued to deteriorate during our 2002 fiscal year, resulting in additional restructuring programs being implemented during our 2002 fiscal year. These restructuring programs included reductions in workforce, re sizing of facilities and the closure of facilities. Industry revenues generally began to stabilize in 2003 and companies continued to turn to outsourcing versus internal manufacturing. During our 2006 fiscal year we initiated a restructuring program to realign our manufacturing capacity in certain higher cost geographies and to properly size our manufacturing sites with perceived market conditions. Over the last three years we have made concentrated efforts to diversify our industry sectors and customer base through acquisitions and organic growth. We believe further growth opportunities exist for the industry to penetrate the worldwide electronics markets. On September 1, 2007, we reorganized our manufacturing business into a Consumer Electronics division and an EMS division. Our AMS division will continue to provide warranty and repair services to certain of our manufacturing customers, but principally to other customers. We believe that these divisions will provide cost effective solutions for our customers by grouping business units with similar needs together into divisions, each with full accountability for design, operations, supply chain and delivery. The Consumer Electronics division has dedicated resources designed to meet the particular needs of the consumer products industry. The division focuses on cell phones and mobile products, televisions, set top boxes and peripheral products such as printers. We intend that the Consumer Electronics division, as a result of its dedicated design resources combined with its vertically integrated supply chain solutions and certain existing and planned manufacturing operations, will provide a focused complement of assets to provide low cost solutions for consumer electronics customers. The EMS division focuses on the traditional and emerging electronic manufacturing services business sectors. Traditional sectors, characterized by longer historical use of the electronics outsourcing model, include networking, computing, storage and telecommunications businesses. Emerging sectors are newer to the outsourcing model and include the automotive, medical, industrial, instrumentation, defense and aerospace sectors. 40 Table of Contents We derive revenue principally from the product sales of electronic equipment built to customer specifications. We recognize revenue, net of estimated product return costs, generally when goods are shipped, title and risk of ownership have passed, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and recoverability is reasonably assured. The volume and timing of orders placed by our customers vary due to several factors, including: variation in demand for our customers products; our customers attempts to manage their inventory; electronic design changes; changes in our customers manufacturing strategies; and acquisitions of or consolidations among our customers. Demand for our customers products depends on, among other things, product life cycles, competitive conditions and general economic conditions. Our cost of revenue includes the cost of electronic components and other materials that comprise the products we manufacture; the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead; and adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory. As a provider of turnkey manufacturing services, we are responsible for procuring components and other materials. This requires us to commit significant working capital to our operations and to manage the purchasing, receiving, inspection and stocking of materials. Although we bear the risk of fluctuations in the cost of materials and excess scrap, we periodically negotiate cost of materials adjustments with our customers. Net revenue from each product that we manufacture consists of an element based on the costs of materials in that product and an element based on the labor and manufacturing overhead costs allocated to that product. We refer to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on materials costs as material based revenue, and to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on labor and manufacturing overhead costs as manufacturing based revenue. Our gross margin for any product depends on the mix between the cost of materials in the product and the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead allocated to the product. We typically realize higher gross margins on manufacturing based revenue than we do on materials based revenue. As we gain experience in manufacturing a product, we usually achieve increased efficiencies, which result in lower labor and manufacturing overhead costs for that product. Our operating results are impacted by the level of capacity utilization of manufacturing facilities; indirect labor costs; and selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high production volume and high capacity utilization. During periods of low production volume, we generally have idle capacity and reduced operating income margins. As our capacity has grown during recent years through the construction of new greenfield facilities, the expansion of existing facilities and our acquisition of additional facilities, our selling, general and administrative expenses have increased to support this growth. We have consistently utilized advanced circuit design, production design and manufacturing technologies to meet the needs of our customers. To support this effort, our engineering staff focuses on developing and refining design and manufacturing technologies to meet specific needs of specific customers. Most of the expenses associated with these customer specific efforts are reflected in our cost of revenue. In addition, our engineers engage in R&D of new technologies that apply generally to our operations. The expenses of these R&D activities are reflected in the Research and Development line item in our Consolidated Statement of Earnings. An important element of our strategy is the expansion of our global production facilities. The majority of our revenue and materials costs worldwide are denominated in U.S. dollars, while our labor and utility costs in plants outside the United States are denominated in local currencies. We economically hedge these local currency costs, based on our evaluation of the potential exposure as compared to the cost of the hedge, through the purchase of foreign exchange contracts. Changes in the fair market value of such hedging instruments are reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. See Risk Factors We are subject to risks of currency fluctuations and related hedging operations. We currently depend, and expect to continue to depend, upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue. A significant reduction in sales to any of our large customers or a customer exerting significant pricing and margin pressures on us would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In the past, some of our customers have terminated their manufacturing arrangements with 41 Table of Contents us or have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of manufacturing services ordered from us. There can be no assurance that present or future customers will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us or significantly change, reduce or delay the amount of manufacturing services ordered from us. Any such termination of a manufacturing relationship or change, reduction or delay in orders could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. See Risk Factors Because we depend on a limited number of customers, a reduction in sales to any one of our customers could cause a significant decline in our revenue and Note 13 Concentration of Risk and Segment Data to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Summary of Results Net revenue for fiscal year 2007 increased approximately 19.7% to $12.3 billion compared to $10.3 billion for fiscal year 2006. Our sales levels during fiscal year 2007 improved across most industry sectors, demonstrating our continued trend of industry sector and customer diversification. The increase in our net revenue base year over year primarily represents stronger market share with our existing programs, organic growth from new and existing customers as vertical companies continue to convert to an outsourcing model, and additional sales related to certain recent business acquisitions. See Note 7 Business Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our recent business acquisitions. Additionally, we continue to enhance our business model by adding services in the areas of collaborative design, system integration, order fulfillment and after market. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan to better align our manufacturing capacity in certain higher cost geographies and to properly size our manufacturing sites with perceived current market conditions (the 2006 Restructuring Plan). Based on the analysis completed to date, we currently expect to recognize approximately $250.0 million in restructuring and impairment charges as a result of the 2006 Restructuring Plan. The restructuring charges include pre tax employee severance and benefit costs, contract termination costs and other related restructuring costs. The impairment charges include pre tax fixed asset impairment costs, as well as valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets. We recognized a significant portion of these costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 and during fiscal year 2007 and currently expect to recognize the remaining portion primarily over the course of fiscal year 2008 with certain contract termination costs to be incurred through fiscal year 2011. The exact timing of the remaining estimated range of restructuring and impairment costs, as well as the remaining estimated cost ranges by category type is subject to revision. This information will be subject to the finalization of the timetables for the transitional functions, consultation with employees and their representatives, as well as the statutory severance requirements of the particular legal jurisdictions impacted. The amount and timing of the actual charges may vary due to a variety of factors. For further discussion of this restructuring program and the restructuring and impairment costs recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 and during fiscal year 2007, refer to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Restructuring and Impairment Charges and Note 10 Restructuring and Impairment Charges to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Risk Factors We face risks arising from the restructuring of our operations. The following table sets forth, for the fiscal year ended August 31, certain key operating results and other financial information (in thousands, except per share data). Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2007 2006 2005 Net revenue $ 12,290,592 $ 10,265,447 $ 7,524,386 Gross profit $ 812,030 $ 764,900 $ 628,506 Operating income $ 181,939 $ 241,807 $ 251,967 Net income $ 73,236 $ 164,518 $ 203,875 Basic earnings per share $ 0.36 $ 0.79 $ 1.01 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.35 $ 0.77 $ 0.98 42 Table of Contents Key Performance Indicators Management regularly reviews financial and non financial performance indicators to assess the Companys operating results. The following table sets forth, for the quarterly periods indicated, certain of managements key financial performance indicators. Three Months Ended August 31, 2007 May 31, 2007 February 28, 2007 November 30, 2006 Sales cycle 19 days 25 days 29 days 23 days Inventory turns 8 turns 8 turns 7 turns 8 turns Days in accounts receivable 39 days 40 days 41 days 42 days Days in inventory 43 days 47 days 50 days 46 days Days in accounts payable 63 days 62 days 62 days 65 days Three Months Ended August 31, 2006 May 31, 2006 February 28, 2006 November 30, 2005 Sales cycle 14 days 19 days 19 days 15 days Inventory turns 8 turns 8 turns 9 turns 9 turns Days in accounts receivable 39 days 40 days 42 days 41 days Days in inventory 47 days 46 days 42 days 38 days Days in accounts payable 72 days 67 days 65 days 64 days The sales cycle is calculated as the sum of days in accounts receivable and days in inventory, less the days in accounts payable; accordingly, the variance in the sales cycle quarter over quarter is a direct result of changes in these indicators. Days in accounts receivable decreased one day to 39 days during the three months ended August 31, 2007 from the prior sequential quarter and decreased one day to 40 days during the three months ended May 31, 2007 from the prior sequential quarter. The decrease in both of these periods was primarily due to timing of sales and cash collection efforts during the quarters. During the three months ended February 28, 2007, days in accounts receivable decreased one day to 41 days as a result of both timing of sales and cash collection efforts during the quarter and related seasonality factors. Days in accounts receivable increased three days to 42 days during the three months ended November 30, 2006 primarily due to the same factors. Days in inventory decreased four days to 43 days during the three months ended August 31, 2007 from the prior sequential quarter and decreased three days to 47 days during the three months ended May 31, 2007 from the prior sequential quarter. Inventory turns remained consistent at eight turns during both of these three month periods. The decrease in days in inventory during the fourth fiscal quarter and third fiscal quarter was primarily due to a reduction in inventory levels as a result of improved inventory management. During the three months ended February 28, 2007, days in inventory increased four days to 50 days in anticipation of forecasted demand and due to inventory acquired in the Green Point acquisition, while inventory turns decreased one turn to 7 turns. Days in inventory decreased one day to 46, while inventory turns remained consistent at 8 turns during the three months ended November 30, 2006. The decrease in days in inventory was primarily a result of increased sales during the quarter and related seasonality factors. Days in accounts payable increased one day to 63 days during the three months ended August 31, 2007 from the prior sequential quarter and remained consistent at 62 days during the three months ended May 31, 2007 from the prior sequential quarter. During the three months ended February 28, 2007 and the three months ended November 20, 2006, days in accounts payable decreased three days to 62 days and decreased seven days to 65 days, respectively, from the prior sequential quarter as a result of timing of purchases and payments for purchases during the quarter. The sales cycle was 14 days during the three months ended August 31, 2006 and was 19 days during the three months ended August 31, 2007. This increase was due to changes in accounts receivable, accounts payable and inventory that are discussed above. 43 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. Management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances. We have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. For further discussion of our significant accounting policies, refer to Note 1 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition We derive revenue principally from the product sales of electronic equipment built to customer specifications. We also derive revenue to a lesser extent from after market services, design services and excess inventory sales. Revenue from product sales and excess inventory sales is generally recognized, net of estimated product return costs, when goods are shipped; title and risk of ownership have passed; the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and recoverability is reasonably assured. Service related revenue is recognized upon completion of the services. We assume no significant obligations after product shipment. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts related to receivables not expected to be collected from our customers. This allowance is based on managements assessment of specific customer balances, considering the age of receivables and financial stability of the customer. If there is an adverse change in the financial condition of our customers, or if actual defaults are higher than provided for, an addition to the allowance may be necessary. Inventory Valuation We purchase inventory based on forecasted demand and record inventory at the lower of cost or market. Management regularly assesses inventory valuation based on current and forecasted usage and other lower of cost or market considerations. If actual market conditions or our customers product demands are less favorable than those projected, additional valuation adjustments may be necessary. Long Lived Assets We review property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of property, plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the projected cash flows the property, plant and equipment are expected to generate. If the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the long lived asset over its respective fair value. The impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management, including revenue and cash flow projections. Circumstances that may lead to impairment of property, plant and equipment include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand and the restructuring of our operations resulting from a change in our business strategy. For further discussion of our current restructuring program, refer to Note 10 Restructuring and Impairment Charges to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Restructuring and Impairment Charges. We have recorded intangible assets, including goodwill, in connection with business acquisitions. Estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are determined by management based on an assessment of the period over which the asset is expected to contribute to future cash flows. The allocation of amortizable intangible assets 44 Table of Contents impacts the amounts allocable to goodwill. In accordance with SFAS 142, we are required to perform a goodwill impairment test at least on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows. We completed the annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 and determined that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test. The impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level, which we have determined to be consistent with our operating segments as defined in Note 13 Concentration of Risk and Segment Data to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The impairment analysis is based on assumptions of future results made by management, including revenue and cash flow projections at the reporting unit level. Circumstances that may lead to impairment of goodwill or intangible assets include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand, and the restructuring of our operations resulting from a change in our business strategy. For further information on our intangible assets, including goodwill, refer to Note 6 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Restructuring and Impairment Charges We have recognized restructuring and impairment charges related to reductions in workforce, re sizing and closure of facilities, and the transition of production from certain facilities into other new and existing facilities. These charges were recorded pursuant to formal plans developed and approved by management. The recognition of restructuring and impairment charges requires that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature, timing and amount of costs associated with these plans. The estimates of future liabilities may change, requiring additional restructuring and impairment charges or the reduction of liabilities already recorded. At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with the restructuring programs. For further discussion of our restructuring programs, refer to Note 10 Restructuring and Impairment Charges to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Restructuring and Impairment Charges. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We have pension and postretirement benefit costs and liabilities, which are developed from actuarial valuations. Actuarial valuations require management to make certain judgments and estimates of discount rates and return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions on a regular basis taking into consideration current market conditions and historical market data. The discount rate is used to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date. This rate represents the market rate for high quality fixed income investments. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. When considering the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets, we take into account current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on plan assets. Other assumptions include demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover. For further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefits, refer to Note 9 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes We estimate our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, a process that includes estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities. We must also make judgments regarding the ability to realize the deferred tax assets. The carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets that we do not believe meet the more likely than not criteria established by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Our judgments regarding future taxable income may change due to changes in market conditions, changes in tax laws or other factors. If our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future, the valuation allowances we have established may be increased 45 Table of Contents or decreased, resulting in a respective increase or decrease in either income tax expense or goodwill. For further discussion related to our income taxes, refer to Note 4 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Stock Based Compensation In accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123R, Share Based Payment, (SFAS 123R) and the Security and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107), we began recognizing stock based compensation expense in our Consolidated Statement of Earnings on September 1, 2005 based on the fair value of our stock based awards. The fair value of options granted prior to September 1, 2005 were valued using the Black Scholes model while the stock appreciation rights granted after this date were valued using a lattice valuation model. Option pricing models require the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the option or stock appreciation right and the price volatility of the underlying stock. Judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock awards that are expected to vest as a result of satisfaction of time based vesting schedules or the achievement of certain performance conditions. If actual results or future changes in estimates differ significantly from our current estimates, stock based compensation could increase or decrease. For further discussion of our stock based compensation, refer to Note 12 Stockholders Equity to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain operating data as a percentage of net revenue. Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2007 2006 2005 Net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenue 93.4 92.5 91.7 Gross profit 6.6 7.5 8.3 Selling, general and administrative 4.0 3.7 4.2 Research and development 0.3 0.4 0.3 Amortization of intangibles 0.2 0.2 0.5 Restructuring and impairment charges 0.6 0.8 Operating income 1.5 2.4 3.3 Other expense 0.1 0.1 Interest income (0.1 ) (0.2 ) (0.2 ) Interest expense 0.7 0.3 0.3 Income before income taxes and minority interest 0.8 2.2 3.2 Income tax expense 0.2 0.6 0.5 Minority Interest 0.0 Net income 0.6 % 1.6 % 2.7 % Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2007 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2006 Net Revenue. Our net revenue increased 19.7% to $12.3 billion for fiscal year 2007, up from $10.3 billion in fiscal year 2006. The increase was due to increased sales levels across most industry sectors, as well as additional sales related to certain recent business acquisitions. See Note 7 Business Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion on our recent business acquisitions. Specific increases include a 84% increase in the sale of networking products; a 36% increase in the sale of other products, principally related to after market services; a 34% increase in the sale of peripheral products; a 22% increase in the sale of 46 Table of Contents instrumentation and medical products; and an 18% increase in the sale of computing and storage products. The level of sales of automotive products and consumer products remained consistent with the prior year while telecommunication sales decreased 13%. The increased sales levels were due to the addition of new customers and organic growth in these industry sectors, as well as additional sales related to certain recent business acquisitions as discussed above. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, revenue by industry sector expressed as a percentage of net revenue. The distribution of revenue across our industry sectors has fluctuated, and will continue to fluctuate, as a result of numerous factors, including but not limited to the following: increased business from new and existing customers; fluctuations in customer demand; seasonality, especially in the automotive and consumer industry sectors; and increased growth in the automotive, consumer, and instrumentation and medical products industry sectors as more vertical companies are electing to outsource their production in these areas. Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2007 2006 2005 Automotive 5 % 5 % 7 % Computing and storage 12 % 12 % 12 % Consumer 29 % 36 % 29 % Instrumentation and medical 17 % 17 % 16 % Networking 20 % 13 % 15 % Peripherals 8 % 7 % 8 % Telecommunications 5 % 6 % 9 % Other 4 % 4 % 4 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % Foreign source revenue represented 78.8% of our net revenue for fiscal year 2007 and 82.3% of net revenue for fiscal year 2006. We currently expect our foreign source revenue to slightly increase as a percentage of net revenue over the course of fiscal year 2008 due to expansion in Asia, Eastern Europe and India. Gross Profit. Gross profit decreased to 6.6% of net revenue in fiscal year 2007 from 7.5% in fiscal year 2006. The percentage decrease from the prior fiscal year was partially due to having a higher portion of materials based revenue, driven in part by growth in our networking sector. In addition, due to the inefficiencies in our current consumer model which has adversely impacted margins, we are shifting to a more integrated model with one customer and shifting to a more vertical solution that will integrate our Green Point services for another significant customer. In addition, we have exited production of targeted products in the consumer sector. In absolute dollars, gross profit for fiscal year 2007 increased $47.1 million versus fiscal year 2006 due to the increased revenue base. Selling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $492.0 million (4.0% of net revenue) from $382.2 million (3.7% of net revenue) in fiscal year 2006. The absolute dollar increase was largely due to increased costs primarily in Eastern Europe and Asia to support our operational growth and expansion within those areas; the acquisition of Green Point in April 2007; incremental stock based compensation expense associated with our annual grant of stock based awards to employees; legal and accounting expenses incurred during fiscal year 2007 related to the independent stock option review that was performed; and incremental costs in fiscal year 2007 due to the acquisition of Celetronix in March 2006. R&D. R&D expenses in fiscal year 2007 increased to $36.4 million (0.3% of net revenue) from $35.0 million (0.4% of net revenue) in fiscal year 2006. The increase is attributed to growth in our product development activities related to new platform designs, including cell phone modules, wireless and broadband 47 Table of Contents access products, consumer entertainment products, and enterprise storage products. We also continued efforts in new product technologies and the related production design processes; and the development of new advanced manufacturing technologies. Amortization of Intangibles. We recorded $29.3 million of amortization of intangibles in fiscal year 2007 as compared to $24.3 million in fiscal year 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to amortization of intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions consummated in fiscal year 2007, offset by certain fully amortized intangible assets. For additional information regarding purchased intangibles, see Acquisitions and Expansion below, Note 1(f) Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Note 6 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Note 7 Business Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Restructuring and Impairment Charges. As mentioned in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Summary of Results, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, we initiated the 2006 Restructuring Plan. The 2006 Restructuring Plan resulted in restructuring and impairment charges of $81.9 million for fiscal year 2006 consisting of employee severance and benefit costs of approximately $67.4 million, costs related to lease commitments of approximately $10.1 million, fixed asset impairments of approximately $3.6 million and other restructuring costs of approximately $0.8 million, primarily related to the repayment of government provided subsidies that resulted from the reduction in force in certain locations. During fiscal year 2007, the 2006 Restructuring Plan resulted in restructuring and impairment charges of $72.4 million, consisting of employee severance and benefit costs of approximately $31.3 million, costs related to lease commitments of approximately $2.7 million, fixed asset impairments of approximately $45.6 million and other restructuring costs of approximately $1.2 million, offset by $8.4 million of proceeds received in connection with facility closure costs. These restructuring and impairment charges related to the 2006 Restructuring Plan incurred through August 31, 2007 of $154.3 million include cash costs totaling $105.9 million, of which $1.5 million was paid in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2006 and $64.8 million was paid in fiscal year 2007. The cash costs consist of employee severance and benefits costs of approximately $99.8 million, costs related to lease commitments of approximately $12.9 million and other restructuring income of $6.8 million. Non cash costs of approximately $48.4 million primarily represent fixed asset impairment charges related to our restructuring activities. At August 31, 2007, liabilities of approximately $31.7 million related to these restructurings activities are expected to be paid out in fiscal year 2008. The remaining liability of $10.5 million is related to certain lease commitments and employee severance and termination benefit payments and is expected to be paid out primarily during fiscal years 2009 through 2011. By the end of fiscal year 2008, as a result of the restructuring activities completed through August 31, 2007 related to the 2006 Restructuring Plan, we expect to avoid annual costs of approximately $130.9 million that would otherwise have been incurred if the restructuring activities had not been completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 and in fiscal year 2007. The expected avoided annual costs consist of a reduction in employee related expenses of approximately $119.5 million, a reduction in depreciation expense associated with impaired fixed assets of approximately $8.5 million, and a reduction in rent expense associated with leased buildings that have been vacated of approximately $2.9 million. The majority of these annual cost savings will be reflected as a reduction in cost of revenue, with a small portion being reflected as a reduction in selling, general and administrative expense. These annual costs savings are expected to be offset by decreased revenues associated with certain products that are approaching the end of life stage; decreased revenues as a result of shifting production to plants located in lower cost regions where competitive environmental pressures require that we pass those cost savings onto our customers; and incremental employee related costs expected to be 48 Table of Contents incurred by those plants to which the production will be shifted. After considering these cost savings offsets, we currently expect to realize net annualized cost savings of approximately $20.0 to $30.0 million by the end of fiscal year 2008. For further discussion of the current restructuring program, see Overview Summary of Results above, and Note 10 Restructuring and Impairment Charges to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, we made the final cash payment related to our historical restructuring program. A liability balance of approximately $308.0 thousand remained after remittance of the final payment. This remaining liability was recorded as a reduction of the fiscal year 2006 restructuring charge. Other Expense. We recorded other expense on the sale of accounts receivable under our securitization program totaling $15.9 million and $11.9 million for the fiscal years ending August 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in other expense was primarily due to an increase in the amount of receivables sold under the program during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2007. For further discussion of our accounts receivable securitization program, see Note 2 Accounts Receivable Securitization to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest Income. Interest income decreased to $14.5 million in fiscal year 2007 from $18.7 million in fiscal year 2006. The decrease was primarily due to lower levels of operating cash, cash deposits and cash equivalents due to the repayment of outstanding borrowings under our debt agreements. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $86.1 million in fiscal year 2007 from $23.5 million in fiscal year 2006. The increase was primarily a result of increased borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, as well as borrowings under our Bridge Facility that was entered into on December 21, 2006, primarily to fund the tender offer and merger with Green Point. Income Taxes. Income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of 22.6% for fiscal year 2007, as compared to an effective tax rate of 26.9% for fiscal year 2006. The decrease is primarily a result of the absence of tax expense associated with recording valuation allowances in fiscal year 2006 of $37.1 million on net deferred tax assets as a result of our restructuring plan. For further discussion of the restructuring plan, see Note 10 Restructuring and Impairment Charges to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The tax rate is predominantly a function of the mix of tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we do business. Our international operations have historically been taxed at a lower rate than in the United States, primarily due to tax incentives, including tax holidays, granted to our sites in Brazil, China, Hungary, India, Malaysia and Poland that expire at various dates through 2017. Such tax holidays are subject to conditions with which we expect to continue to comply. See Note 4 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2006 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2005 Net Revenue. Our net revenue increased 36.4% to $10.3 billion for fiscal year 2006, up from $7.5 billion in fiscal year 2005. The increase was due to increased sales levels across most industry sectors. Specific increases include a 68% increase in the sale of consumer products; a 51% increase in the sale of instrumentation and medical products; a 28% increase in the sale of computing and storage products; a 16% increase in the sale of networking products; and a 27% increase in the sale of peripheral products. The level of sales of automotive products and telecommunications products remained consistent with the prior year. The increased sales levels were due to the addition of new customers and organic growth in these industry sectors. The increase in the consumer industry sector was primarily attributable to new and existing program growth resulting from our product diversification efforts within the sector. The increase in the instrumentation and medical industry sector was primarily attributable to increased sales levels as more vertical companies are electing to outsource their production in these areas. 49 Table of Contents The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, revenue by industry sector expressed as a percentage of net revenue. The distribution of revenue across our industry sectors has fluctuated, and will continue to fluctuate, as a result of numerous factors, including but not limited to the following: increased business from new and existing customers; fluctuations in customer demand; seasonality, especially in the automotive and consumer industry sectors; and increased growth in the automotive, consumer, and instrumentation and medical products industry sectors as more vertical companies are electing to outsource their production in these areas. Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2006 2005 2004 Automotive 5 % 7 % 8 % Computing and storage 12 % 12 % 13 % Consumer 36 % 29 % 25 % Instrumentation and medical 17 % 16 % 12 % Networking 13 % 15 % 20 % Peripherals 7 % 8 % 6 % Telecommunications 6 % 9 % 11 % Other 4 % 4 % 5 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % Foreign source revenue represented 82.3% of our net revenue for fiscal year 2006 and 83.8% of net revenue for fiscal year 2005. Gross Profit. Gross profit decreased to 7.5% of net revenue in fiscal year 2006 from 8.3% in fiscal year 2005. The percentage decrease from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to a higher portion of materials based revenue (driven in part by growth in the consumer industry sector). In addition, certain higher than anticipated expenses were incurred during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2006. These included delays in our ramp up of our electromechanical tooling operations due to resolvable technical issues, management process software and a change in a customers timing needs for tools, which resulted in excess costs; certain material and labor costs associated with the higher than anticipated rate of needed repair on a new program for an existing customer in our after market services operations in the Americas region; and various operational execution issues in one of our U.S. operations, some of which was associated with strong demand and the commencement of new programs. In absolute dollars, gross profit for fiscal year 2006 increased $136.4 million versus fiscal year 2005 due to the increased revenue base. Selling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $382.2 million (3.7% of net revenue) from $314.3 million (4.2% of net revenue) in fiscal year 2005. The absolute dollar increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Varian Electronics Manufacturing (VEM) in March 2005 and Celetronix in March 2006; the recognition of stock based compensation expense resulting from the adoption of SFAS 123R; additional resources to support our continued growth; and incremental legal and professional fees incurred due to the review of our historical stock option practices. R&D. R&D expenses in fiscal year 2006 increased to $35.0 million (0.4% of net revenue) from $22.5 million (0.3% of net revenue) in fiscal year 2005. The increase is attributed to growth in our product development activities related to new reference and product designs, including networking and server products, cell phone products, wireless and broadband access products, consumer products, and storage products. We also continued efforts in the design of circuit board assembly; mechanical design and the related production design process; and the development of new advanced manufacturing technologies. 50 Table of Contents Amortization of Intangibles. We recorded $24.3 million of amortization of intangibles in fiscal year 2006 as compared to $39.8 million in fiscal year 2005. The decrease was attributable to intangible assets that became fully amortized in fiscal year 2005 and fiscal year 2006, offset by amortization of intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions consummated in fiscal year 2005 and 2006. For additional information regarding purchased intangibles, see Acquisitions and Expansion below, Note 1(f) Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Note 6 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Note 7 Business Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Restructuring and Impairment Charges. As mentioned in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Summary of Results, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, we initiated a restructuring program to realign our manufacturing capacity in certain higher cost geographies and to properly size our manufacturing sites with perceived current market conditions. This current restructuring program resulted in restructuring and impairment charges of $81.9 million for fiscal year 2006 consisting of employee severance and benefit costs of approximately $67.4 million, costs related to lease commitments of approximately $10.1 million, fixed asset impairments of approximately $3.6 million and other restructuring costs of approximately $0.8 million, primarily related to the repayment of government provided subsidies that resulted from the reduction in force in certain locations. These restructuring and impairment charges included cash costs totaling $78.6 million, of which $1.5 million was paid in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2006. The cash costs consist of employee severance and benefits costs of approximately $67.6 million, costs related to lease commitments of approximately $10.2 million and other restructuring costs of $0.8 million. Non cash costs of approximately $3.3 million primarily represent fixed asset impairment charges related to our restructuring activities. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, we made the final cash payment related to our historical restructuring program. A liability balance of approximately $308.0 thousand remained after remittance of the final payment. This remaining liability was recorded as a reduction of the fiscal year 2006 restructuring charge. There were no restructuring and impairment charges incurred during fiscal year 2005. Other Expense. We recorded other expense on the sale of accounts receivable under our securitization program totaling $11.9 million and $4.1 million for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in other expense was primarily due to an increase in the amount of receivables sold under the program during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2006. Subsequent to January 2005, several amendments increased the net cash proceeds available at any one time under the program from $120.0 million to $250.0 million. For further discussion of our accounts receivable securitization program, see Note 2 Accounts Receivable Securitization to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest Income. Interest income increased to $18.7 million in fiscal year 2006 from $13.8 million in fiscal year 2005. The increase was primarily due to higher interest yields on higher levels of operating cash, cash deposits and cash equivalents. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $23.5 million in fiscal year 2006 from $20.7 million in fiscal year 2005. The increase was primarily a result of higher borrowing levels under our unsecured revolving credit facility and under other revolving credit facilities and debt agreements in place at a subsidiary level. Additionally, we incurred higher interest on our fixed 5.875% Senior Notes issued in July of 2003 due to the termination of the interest rate swap agreement in June 2005. The interest rate swap effectively converted the fixed interest rate of the 5.875% Senior Notes to a variable rate during the nine months ended May 31, 2005, which was more favorable than the fixed rate of interest incurred subsequent to May 31, 2005. See Note 8 Notes Payable, Long Term Debt and Long Term Lease Obligations to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes. Income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of 26.9% for fiscal year 2006, as compared to an effective tax rate of 15.4% for fiscal year 2005. The increase is primarily a result of the tax expense associated with recording valuation allowances of $37.1 million on net deferred tax assets as a result of our 51 Table of Contents restructuring plan. For further discussion of the restructuring plan, see Note 10 Restructuring and Impairment Charges to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This increase was partially offset by the tax benefit associated with stock based compensation expense realized in accordance with SFAS 123R, which we adopted in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006. The tax rate is predominantly a function of the mix of tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we do business. Our international operations have historically been taxed at a lower rate than in the United States, primarily due to tax incentives, including tax holidays, granted to our sites in Brazil, China, Hungary, India, Malaysia and Poland that expire at various dates through 2017. Such tax holidays are subject to conditions with which we expect to continue to comply. See Note 4 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In October 2004, the President signed into law the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Jobs Creation Act). The Jobs Creation Act created a temporary incentive for U.S. multinational companies to repatriate accumulated foreign earnings by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain eligible dividends. The deduction was subject to a number of limitations and requirements, including a formal plan for domestic reinvestment of the dividends. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position No. 109 2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (FSP 109 2). FSP 109 2 provided guidance under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109), with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the Jobs Creation Act on enterprises income tax expense and deferred tax liability. Under FSP 109 2, we had until August 31, 2006 to complete the evaluation of the effect of the Jobs Creation Act on our plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying SFAS 109. Based upon the completed evaluation, the Company will continue its plan to indefinitely reinvest income from all of its foreign subsidiaries and will not repatriate accumulated foreign earnings to take advantage of the 85% dividends received deduction created by the Jobs Creation Act. 52 Table of Contents Quarterly Results (Unaudited) The following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly financial information for the 2007 and 2006 fiscal years. In the opinion of management, this information has been presented on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere, and all necessary adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the unaudited quarterly results when read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto. The operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period.

(2) We received an $8.4 million reimbursement pursuant to an agreement with a company from which we previously purchased certain facilities in order to reimburse us for certain costs related to the closure of a manufacturing facility in Europe. As they relate to activities for which the revenues and expenses have historically been included in our operating income, we have reclassified these $8.4 million of proceeds from other income to restructuring and impairment charges on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. 53 Table of Contents The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain financial information stated as a percentage of net revenue: Fiscal Year 2007 Fiscal Year 2006 Aug. 31, 2007 May 31, 2007 Feb. 28, 2007 Nov. 30, 2006 Aug. 31, 2006 May 31, 2006 Feb. 28, 2006 Nov. 30, 2005 Net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenue 92.7 92.7 94.2 94.0 93.3 92.8 92.0 91.9 Gross profit 7.3 7.3 5.8 6.0 6.7 7.2 8.0 8.1 Selling, general and administrative 3.9 4.7 4.1 3.4 3.7 3.6 3.8 3.9 Research and development 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.4 0.4 0.3 Amortization of intangibles 0.3 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.3 0.2 0.2 Restructuring and impairment charges 1.2 0.8 0.0 0.2 2.8 Operating income 1.6 1.2 1.2 1.9 (0.3 ) 2.9 3.6 3.7 Other (income) expense 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.2 Interest income (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.2 ) (0.2 ) (0.2 ) Interest expense 0.8 1.0 0.7 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.3 Income before income taxes and minority interest 0.8 0.2 0.5 1.5 (0.6 ) 2.8 3.5 3.6 Income tax (benefit) expense 0.4 0.0 0.1 0.2 1.0 0.3 0.5 0.4 Minority Interest 0.0 0.0 0.0 Net income 0.4 % 0.2 % 0.4 % 1.3 % (1.6 )% 2.5 % 3.0 % 3.2 % Acquisitions and Expansion We have made a number of acquisitions that were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Our consolidated financial statements include the operating results of each business from the date of acquisition. See Risk Factors We may not achieve expected profitability from our acquisitions. For further discussion of our recent and planned acquisitions, see Note 7 Business Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We have substantially completed construction and will commence operations in our new manufacturing facilities in Uzhgorod, Ukraine and Chennai, India in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. We have also substantially completed construction of an additional facility in Huangpu, China and will commence operations in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. We began construction on an expansion to our existing facility in Kwidzyn, Poland and expect to be substantially complete by the third quarter of fiscal year 2008. As discussed in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview and Note 7 Business Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we entered into a merger agreement on November 22, 2006 with Green Point, pursuant to which Green Point agreed to merge with and into an existing Jabil entity in Taiwan. The legal merger was effective on April 24, 2007. The legal merger was primarily achieved through a tender offer that we made to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of Green Point for 109.0 New Taiwan dollars per share. The tender offer was launched on November 23, 2006 and remained open for a period of 50 days. During the tender offer period, we acquired approximately 260.9 million shares, representing 97.6% of the outstanding shares of Green Point. On January 16, 2007, we paid cash in the amount of approximately $870.7 million (in U.S. dollars) to acquire the tendered shares. Subsequent to the completion of the tender offer and prior to the completion of the acquisition, we acquired approximately 2.1 million Green Point shares in block trades for a price of 109.0 New Taiwan dollars per share (or an approximate total of $7.0 million in U.S. dollars). On April 24, 2007, pursuant to the November 22, 2006 merger agreement, we acquired the approximately 4.1 million remaining outstanding Green Point shares that were not 54 Table of Contents tendered during the tender offer period, for 109.0 New Taiwan dollars per share (or an approximate total of $13.3 million in U.S. dollars). In total, we paid a total cash amount of approximately $891.0 million in U.S. dollars to complete the merger with Green Point. To fund the acquisition, we entered into a $1.0 billion, 364 day senior unsecured bridge loan facility with a syndicate of banks on December 21, 2006. The financial results of Green Point were included in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on January 16, 2007. We recorded a minority interest in our Consolidated Financial Statements from January 16, 2007 through April 24, 2007 related to the remaining 2.4% of Green Point outstanding shares that we acquired on April 24, 2007. Seasonality Production levels for our consumer division and the automotive industry sector of our EMS division are subject to seasonal influences. We may realize greater net revenue during our first fiscal quarter due to high demand for consumer products during the holiday selling season. Dividends The following table sets forth certain information relating to our cash dividends paid or declared to common stockholders during fiscal years 2006 and 2007. Dividend Information Dividend declaration date Dividend per share Total of cashdividendspaid Date of record fordividend payment Dividend cashpayment date (in thousands, except per share data) Fiscal year 2006: May 4, 2006 $ 0.07 $ 14,855 May 15, 2006 June 1, 2006 August 2, 2006 $ 0.07 $ 14,295 August 15, 2006 September 1, 2006 Fiscal year 2007: November 2, 2006 $ 0.07 $ 14,378 November 15, 2006 December 1, 2006 January 22, 2007 $ 0.07 $ 14,414 February 15, 2007 March 1, 2007 April 30, 2007 $ 0.07 $ 14,517 May 15, 2007 June 1, 2007 August 2, 2007 $ 0.07 $ 14,559 August 15, 2007 September 4, 2007 We currently expect to continue to declare and pay quarterly dividends of an amount similar to our past declarations. However, the declaration and payment of future dividends are discretionary and will be subject to determination by our Board of Directors each quarter following its review of our financial performance. Liquidity and Capital Resources At August 31, 2007, we had cash and cash equivalent balances totaling $663.6 million, total notes payable, long term debt and capital lease obligations of $1.3 billion and $996.6 million available for borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and accounts receivable securitization program. The following table sets forth, for the fiscal year ended August 31 selected consolidated cash flow information (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2007 2006 2005 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 183,889 $ 448,176 $ 590,001 Net cash used in investing activities (1,054,422 ) (417,470 ) (488,694 ) Net cash provided (used in) by financing activities 715,140 (67,906 ) 60,940 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 45,455 14,692 12,502 Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (109,938 ) $ (22,508 ) $ 174,749 55 Table of Contents Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2007 was $183.9 million. This consisted primarily of $73.2 million of net income, $239.7 million of depreciation and amortization, $72.4 million of non cash restructuring charges, $43.3 million of non cash stock based compensation expense, $201.5 million decrease in inventory and $126.0 million decrease in accounts receivable. The decrease in inventory was due primarily to improved inventory management. The decrease in accounts receivable was due primarily to improved cash collections and by the sale of an incremental $43.2 million of receivables under our securitization program. These sources of cash were partially offset by $32.1 million in deferred income taxes, decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $482.8 million and increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $82.4 million. The decrease in accounts payable was due to the decrease in inventory and timing of purchases near year end. The increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was due primarily to an increase in refundable value added taxes. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2007 was $1.1 billion. This consisted primarily of net cash of $771.9 million paid for the acquisition of Green Point and several other immaterial business acquisitions; and our capital expenditures of $302.2 million for manufacturing and computer equipment to support our ongoing business across all segments and for expansion activities in Asia, Eastern Europe and India. These expenditures were partially offset by $19.7 million of proceeds from the sale of certain excess property, plant and equipment. Net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year 2007 was $715.1 million. This resulted from $4.4 billion in borrowings under debt agreements and $3.7 billion of payments towards those debt agreements and capital lease obligations. The borrowings under debt agreements consist primarily of $2.8 billion under the revolving portion of the Revolving Credit Facility, $400.0 million under the term portion of the Revolving Credit Facility and $1.0 billion under the Bridge Facility. Payments toward debt agreements and capital lease obligations primarily consist of $2.8 billion under the Revolving Credit Facility and $631.0 million under the Bridge Facility. See Note 8 Notes Payable, Long Term Debt and Long Term Lease Obligations to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We may need to finance future growth and any corresponding working capital needs with additional borrowings under our revolving credit facilities described below, as well as additional public and private offerings of our debt and equity. During the first quarter of fiscal year 1999, we filed a $750.0 million shelf registration statement with the SEC registering the potential sale of debt and equity securities in the future, from time to time, to augment our liquidity and capital resources. In June 2000, we sold 13.0 million shares of our common stock pursuant to our shelf registration statement, which generated net proceeds of $525.4 million. In August 2000, we increased the amount of securities available to be issued under a shelf registration statement to $1.5 billion. Approximately $855.0 million of securities remain registered with the SEC under our shelf registration statement at August 31, 2007. The Securities Act of 1933 (the Act) Offering Reform, which was effective on December 1, 2005, has significantly modified the registration and offering process under the Act. Based on the new registration and offering regime, we may file a new shelf registration statement to replace the existing shelf. Under the new rules, we anticipate that once we have timely filed all periodic reports under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 for one year from the date we became current on those filings, we will be classified as a well known seasoned issuer, thereby allowing us to take advantage of the simplified registration procedures. At this time, we are still evaluating whether to file a new shelf registration statement. As a result of our delayed filing of Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2006 and Form 10 Q for the periods ending November 30, 2006 and February 28, 2007, we will be ineligible to issue shares under our shelf registration until we have timely filed all periodic reports under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 for one year from the date we became current on those filings. The Company became current with the filing of Form 10 Q for the quarter ending May 31, 2007 on July 6, 2007. 56 Table of Contents In July 2003, we issued a total of $300.0 million, seven year, 5.875% Senior Notes at 99.803% of par, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $297.2 million. The 5.875% Senior Notes were offered pursuant to our shelf registration statement. The 5.875% Senior Notes mature on July 15, 2010 and pay interest semiannually on January 15 and July 15. We are subject to covenants such as: limitation upon our consolidation, merger or sale, limitation upon our liens, limitation upon our sales and leasebacks, limitation upon our subsidiaries funded debt, limitation on guarantees given by our subsidiaries for our indebtedness, our corporate existence, reports, and compliance and notice requirements. In July 2003, we entered into an interest rate swap transaction to effectively convert the fixed interest rate of our 5.875% Senior Notes to a variable rate. The swap, which was to expire in 2010, was accounted for as a fair value hedge under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities (SFAS 133). The notional amount of the swap was $300.0 million, which is related to the 5.875% Senior Notes. Under the terms of the swap, we paid an interest rate equal to the six month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) rate, set in arrears, plus a fixed spread of 1.945%. In exchange, we received a fixed rate of 5.875%. The swap transaction qualified for the shortcut method of recognition under SFAS 133, therefore no portion of the swap was treated as ineffective. The interest rate swap was terminated on June 3, 2005. The fair value of the interest rate swap of $4.5 million was recorded in long term liabilities, with the corresponding offset recorded as a decrease to the carrying value of the 5.875% Senior Notes, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at the termination date. In addition, we had recorded $0.4 million of interest receivable from the issuing bank as of the termination date. Upon termination, Jabil made a net $4.1 million cash payment to the issuing bank to derecognize the interest rate swap and the accrued interest. The $4.5 million decrease to the carrying value of the 5.875% Senior Notes on the Consolidated Balance Sheet will be amortized to earnings through interest expense over the remaining term of the debt. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2006, we renewed our existing 0.6 billion Japanese yen (approximately $5.1 million based on currency exchange rates at August 31, 2006) credit facility for a Japanese subsidiary with a Japanese bank. Under the terms of the renewed facility, we pay interest on outstanding borrowings based on the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread of 0.50%. The renewed credit facility expired on December 2, 2006 and all outstanding borrowings were fully paid. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, we entered into the five year Revolving Credit Facility. This agreement provides for a revolving credit portion in the initial amount of $800.0 million, subject to potential increases up to $1.0 billion, and provides for a term portion in the amount of $400.0 million. Some or all of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and their affiliates have various other relationships with us and our subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services, including cash management, loans, letter of credit and bank guarantee facilities, investment banking and trust services. We, along with some of our subsidiaries, have entered into foreign exchange contracts and other derivative arrangements with certain of the lenders and their affiliates. In addition, many, if not most, of the agents and lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility hold positions as agent and or lender under our old revolving credit facility and the Bridge Facility. The revolving credit portion of the Revolving Credit Facility terminates on July 19, 2012, and the term loan portion of the Revolving Credit Facility requires payments of principal in annual installments of $20.0 million each, with a final payment of the remaining principal due on July 19, 2012. Interest and fees on Revolving Credit Facility advances are based on our unsecured long term indebtedness rating as determined by Standard & Poors Rating Service and Moodys Investor Service. Interest is charged at a rate equal to either 0% to 0.75% above the base rate or 0.375% to 1.75% above the Eurocurrency rate, where the base rate represents the greater of Citibank, N.A.s prime rate or 0.50% above the federal funds rate, and the Eurocurrency rate represents the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate, each as more fully defined in this credit agreement. Fees include a facility fee based on the revolving credit commitments of the lenders, a letter of credit fee based on the amount of outstanding letters of credit, and a utilization fee to be added to the revolving credit interest rate and any letter of credit fee during any period when the aggregate amount of outstanding advances and letters of credit exceeds 50% of the total revolving credit commitments of the lenders. Based on our current senior unsecured long term indebtedness rating as determined by Standard & Poors Rating Service and Moodys Investor Service, the 57 Table of Contents current rate of interest (including the applicable facility and utilization fee) on a full draw under the revolving credit would be 0.20% above the base rate or 0.625% above the Eurocurrency rate, and the current rate of interest on the term portion would be the base rate or 0.625% above the Eurocurrency rate. We, along with our subsidiaries, are subject to the following financial covenants: (1) a maximum ratio of (a) Debt (as defined in the credit agreement) to (b) Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement) and (2) a minimum ratio of (a) Consolidated EBITDA to (b) interest payable on, and amortization of debt discount in respect of, Debt and loss on sales of accounts receivables pursuant to our securitization program. In addition, we are subject to other covenants, such as: limitation upon liens; limitation upon mergers, etc; limitation upon accounting changes; limitation upon subsidiary debt; limitation upon sales, etc of assets; limitation upon changes in nature of business; payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries; compliance with laws, etc; payment of taxes, etc; maintenance of insurance; preservation of corporate existence, etc; visitation rights; keeping of books; maintenance of properties, etc; transactions with affiliates; and reporting requirements. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, we borrowed $616.0 million against the revolving credit portion of the Revolving Credit Facility. These borrowings were repaid in full during the fourth quarter. A draw in the amount of $400.0 million has been made under the term portion of the Revolving Credit Facility and remains outstanding at August 31, 2007. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2004, we entered into an asset backed securitization program with a bank, which originally provided for net cash proceeds at any one time of an amount up to $100.0 million on the sale of eligible accounts receivable of certain domestic operations. Subsequent to fiscal year 2004, several amendments have increased the net cash proceeds available at any one time under the securitization program up to an amount of $325.0 million. In addition, the securitization program has been extended to February 2008. Under this agreement, we continuously sell a designated pool of trade accounts receivable to a wholly owned subsidiary, which in turn sells an ownership interest in the receivables to a conduit, administered by an unaffiliated financial institution. This wholly owned subsidiary is a separate bankruptcy remote entity and its assets would be available first to satisfy the claims of the conduit. As the receivables sold are collected, we are able to sell additional receivables up to the maximum permitted amount under the program. The securitization program requires compliance with several financial covenants including an interest coverage ratio and debt to EBITDA ratio, as defined in the securitization agreements, as amended. For each pool of eligible receivables sold to the conduit, we retain a percentage interest in the face value of the receivables, which is calculated based on the terms of the agreement. Net receivables sold under this program are excluded from accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are reflected as cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. We continue to service, administer and collect the receivables sold under this program. We pay facility fees of 0.15% per annum of 102% of the average purchase limit and program fees of up to 0.15% of outstanding amounts. The investors and the securitization conduit have no recourse to our assets for failure of debtors to pay when due. As of August 31, 2007, we had sold $391.5 million of eligible accounts receivable, which represents the face amount of total outstanding receivables at that date. In exchange, we received cash proceeds of $293.6 million and retained an interest in the receivables of approximately $97.9 million. In connection with the securitization program, we recognized pretax losses on the sale of receivables of approximately $15.9 million, $11.9 million and $4.1 million during the fiscal years ended August 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which are recorded as other expense on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2005, we entered into an agreement with an unrelated third party for the factoring of specific accounts receivable of a foreign subsidiary. Under the terms of the factoring agreement, we transfer ownership of eligible accounts receivable without recourse to the third party purchaser in exchange for cash. Proceeds on the transfer reflect the face value of the account less a discount. The discount is recorded as a loss on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings in the period of the sale. The factoring agreement expired in March 2007 and was extended for a six month period. The receivables sold pursuant to this factoring agreement are excluded from accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are reflected as cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. We continue to service, administer and collect the receivables sold under this program. The third party purchaser has no recourse to our assets for failure of debtors to pay when due. At August 31, 2007, we had sold $38.4 million of accounts receivable, which represents the face amount of total outstanding receivables at that date. In exchange, we received cash proceeds of 58 Table of Contents $38.4 million. The accounts receivable sold under this factoring agreement and the resulting loss on the sale were insignificant for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2005, we negotiated a five year, 400.0 million Indian rupee construction loan for an Indian subsidiary with an Indian branch of a global bank. Under the terms of the loan, we pay interest on outstanding borrowings based on a fixed rate of 7.45%. The construction loan expires on April 15, 2010 and all outstanding borrowings are then due and payable. The 400.0 million Indian rupee principal outstanding is equivalent to approximately $9.8 million based on currency exchange rates at August 31, 2007. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2005, we negotiated a five year, 25.0 million Euro construction loan for a Hungarian subsidiary with a Hungarian branch of a global bank. Under the terms of the loan facility, we pay interest on outstanding borrowings based on the Euro Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread of 0.925%. Quarterly principal repayments began in September 2006 to repay the amount of proceeds drawn under the construction loan. The construction loan expires on April 13, 2010. At August 31, 2007, borrowings of 15.8 million Euros (approximately $21.6 million based on currency exchange rates at August 31, 2007) were outstanding under the construction loan. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2006, we negotiated a short term, 225.0 million Indian rupee credit facility for an Indian subsidiary with an Indian branch of a global bank. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, this facility was increased to 750.0 million Indian rupees. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, this facility was reduced to 700.0 million Indian rupees (approximately $17.1 million based on currency exchange rates at August 31, 2007). Under the terms of the facility, we pay interest on outstanding borrowings based on a fixed rate mutually agreed with the bank at the time of borrowing. At August 31, 2007, borrowings of 695.0 million Indian rupees (approximately $17.0 million based on currency exchange rates at August 31, 2007) were outstanding under this facility and incurring interest at an average rate of 10.1%. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2006, we acquired the operations of Celetronix as discussed in Note 7 Business Acquisitions. Through the acquisition we assumed certain liabilities, including a short term financing obligation of approximately $51.1 million at the date of acquisition. This financing obligation was associated with an accounts receivable discounting agreement with a global bank, which was discontinued at the closing of the acquisition on March 31, 2006. Cash collected on the related accounts receivable was remitted to the bank to satisfy the obligation and all outstanding amounts were paid in full by the expiration date of July 15, 2006. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2006, we assumed a short term Chinese yuan renminbi credit facility for an acquired Chinese subsidiary with a Chinese bank. Under the terms of the facility, the bank determines the maximum borrowing limit and applicable fixed interest rate at the time of borrowing. At the date of acquisition, there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility. On November 9, 2006, the pre existing agreement expired and we repaid the 15.0 million Chinese yuan renminbi on that date. Also on November 9, 2006, we negotiated a new loan agreement with a maximum of 20.0 million Chinese yuan renminbi. Under the terms of the agreement, borrowings are due and payable six months after the draw down date. The loan agreement expired on May 8, 2007. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility upon expiration. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2006, we entered into a sale leaseback transaction involving our facility in Ayr, Scotland. We continue to occupy the facility through a three year leasing arrangement with the third party purchaser, which requires quarterly lease payments of 62.5 thousand pounds sterling (approximately $126.1 thousand based on currency exchange rates at August 31, 2007). We received cash proceeds of approximately 2.8 million pounds sterling (approximately $4.8 million based on currency exchange rates on the date of the transaction) and retained a right to receive additional consideration upon resale of the facility at a later date. Due primarily to our continuing involvement in the property, we were precluded from recording the transaction as a sale under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, as required by relevant accounting standards, the cash 59 Table of Contents proceeds were recorded as a financing obligation. A portion of the quarterly lease payments are recorded as interest expense, based on an effective yield of 5.875%, and the remainder is recorded as a reduction of the financing obligation. At August 31, 2007, the balance of the financing obligation is approximately 2.6 million pounds sterling (approximately $5.3 million based on currency exchange rates at August 31, 2007). During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, we entered into a short term, $45.0 million working capital facility for an Indian subsidiary with an Indian branch of a global bank. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2007, the working capital facility was increased to $60.0 million. Borrowings under this facility are revolving in nature and are outstanding for a period of up to 180 days. Under the terms of the facility, we pay interest on outstanding borrowings based on LIBOR plus a spread of 0.5%. At August 31, 2007, borrowings of $11.3 million were outstanding under this facility. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2007, we entered into a $1.0 billion Bridge Facility. The Bridge Facility expires on December 20, 2007. Of the Bridge Facility, $900.0 million was designated for use by us as a one time borrowing (which may be paid down in increments) to finance the tender offer for and merger with Green Point to pay related costs and expenses. The remaining $100.0 million of the Bridge Facility which is now terminated was a revolving facility to be used for our general corporate purposes. Interest and fees on Bridge Facility advances are based on our unsecured long term indebtedness rating as determined by Standard & Poors Rating Service and Moodys Investor Service. Interest is charged at either a rate equal to 0% to 0.75% above the base rate or a rate equal to 0.55% to 1.75% above the Eurocurrency rate, where the base rate represents the greater of Citibank, N.A.s prime rate or 0.50% plus the federal funds rate, and the Eurocurrency rate represents the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate, each as more fully defined in the Bridge Facility. The applicable margin for the base rate and the Eurocurrency rate may be increased by 0.25% or 0.50% per annum, depending on the length of time that the Bridge Facility remains outstanding. Fees include unused commitment fees based on the amount of each lenders commitment minus the principal amount of any outstanding advances made by the lender. Based on our current unsecured long term indebtedness rating as determined by Standard & Poors Rating Service and Moodys Investor Service, the current rate of interest on a full Eurocurrency rate draw (including the step up) would be 0.50% above the base rate or 1.25% above the Eurocurrency rate, as defined above. The Bridge Facility requires compliance with several financial covenants, including an indebtedness to EBITDA ratio and an interest coverage ratio, as defined by the Bridge Facility. We are subject to the following financial covenants: (1) a maximum ratio of (a) Debt (as defined in the Bridge Facility) to (b) Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Bridge Facility) and (2) a minimum ratio of (a) Consolidated EBITDA to (b) interest payable on, and amortization of debt discount in respect of, Debt. In addition, we are subject to other covenants, such as: limitation upon liens; limitation upon mergers, etc; limitation upon accounting changes; limitation upon subsidiary debt; limitation upon sales, etc of assets; limitation upon changes in nature of business; payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries; compliance with laws, etc; payment of taxes, etc; maintenance of insurance; preservation of corporate existence, etc; visitation rights; keeping of books; maintenance of properties, etc; transactions with affiliates; and reporting requirements. We are currently actively seeking a refinancing of our Bridge Facility. See Risk Factors We must refinance or repay our Bridge Facility on or before December 20, 2007 which will require additional financing that we cannot assure you will be available to us on attractive terms unless we issue additional equity. On various dates during fiscal year 2007, we borrowed approximately $871.0 million under the one time borrowing portion of the Bridge Facility to fund the acquisition of Green Point and a total of approximately $160.0 million under the revolving portion of the Bridge Facility. During the same 12 month period we repaid $471.0 million of borrowings on the one time borrowing portion of the Bridge Facility and $160.0 million on the revolving facility portion of the Bridge Facility. At August 31, 2007, borrowings of $400.0 million remained outstanding under this facility. Through the acquisition of Green Point we assumed certain liabilities, including short and long term debt obligations totaling approximately $102.2 million at the date of acquisition. At August 31, 2007, approximately $4.7 million of debt is outstanding under these short term facilities, with current interest rates ranging from 2.8% to 6.0%. The long term debt obligations include mortgage and credit facilities with various 60 Table of Contents banks in Taiwan and China. The long term facilities are denominated in U.S. dollars and New Taiwan dollars, and incur interest at both fixed rates and rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base interest rates. At August 31, 2007, approximately $57.4 million of debt is outstanding under the long term facilities, with current interest rates ranging from 1.0% to 3.9%. Approximately $11.0 million of this total is due and payable within 12 months and is classified as short term on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The remaining $46.4 million will mature at various dates through July 2012 and is classified as long term on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2007, we entered into a three year loan agreement to borrow, $20.3 million from a software vendor in connection with various software licenses that we purchased from them. The software licenses were capitalized and are being amortized over a three year period. The loan agreement is non interest bearing and payments are due quarterly through October 2009. At August 31, 2007, $15.3 million is outstanding under this loan agreement. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2007, we entered into a one year, 29.9 million Taiwan dollar credit facility for a Taiwanese subsidiary with a Taiwan branch of a global bank. Borrowings under this facility are revolving in nature. Under the terms of the facility, we pay interest on outstanding borrowings at a rate determined by the bank at the time of borrowing. At August 31, 2007, borrowings of 19.0 million Taiwan dollars (approximately $0.6 million based on currency exchange rates at August 31, 2007) were outstanding under this facility and incurring interest at an average rate of 2.8%. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2007, we entered into a short term, $2.0 million credit facility for an Indian subsidiary with an Indian branch of a global bank. Borrowings under this facility are revolving in nature and are outstanding for a period of up to 360 days. Under the terms of the facility, we pay interest on outstanding borrowings based on LIBOR plus a spread of 0.5%. At August 31, 2007, borrowings of $2.0 million were outstanding under this facility. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, we entered into a short term, $360.0 thousand credit facility for an Indian subsidiary with an Indian branch of a global bank. Borrowings under this facility are revolving in nature and are outstanding for a period of up to 360 days. Under the terms of the facility, we pay interest on outstanding borrowings based on LIBOR plus a spread of 0.5%. At August 31, 2007, borrowings of $349.0 thousand were outstanding under this facility. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, we entered into a short term, 66.6 million Japanese yen import financing facility for an Indian subsidiary with an Indian branch of a global bank. Borrowings under this facility are revolving in nature and are outstanding for a period of up to 360 days. Under the terms of this facility, we pay interest on outstanding borrowings based on LIBOR plus a spread of 0.5%. At August 31, 2007, borrowings of 48.0 million Japanese yen (approximately $0.4 million based on currency exchange rates at August 31, 2007) were outstanding under this facility. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, we entered into a 1.1 billion Indian rupee credit facility for an Indian subsidiary with an Indian branch of a global bank. Borrowings under this facility are revolving in nature and incur interest at a rate determined by the bank at the time of borrowing. At August 31, 2007, borrowings of 440.0 million Indian rupees (approximately $10.8 million based on currency exchange rates at August 31, 2007) were outstanding under this facility and incurring interest at an average rate of 10.08%. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, we entered into a long term, 400.0 million Indian rupee loan agreement for an Indian subsidiary with an Indian branch of a global bank. Borrowings under this facility will incur interest at a fixed rate of 10.5%. Proceeds under the loan will be drawn at various future dates and will be due and payable after a three year period. At August 31, 2007, no borrowings were outstanding under this loan agreement. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, we entered into forward interest rate swap transactions to effectively lock in the July 2007 fixed interest rate for an anticipated debt issuance to refinance the Bridge 61 Table of Contents Facility. The swaps are accounted for as a cash flow hedge under SFAS 133. Under the terms of the swaps, we will pay a fixed rate and will receive a variable rate based on the three month USD LIBOR rate plus a credit spread. The notional amount of the swaps is $400.0 million and the swaps will be terminated no later than November 15, 2007. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, we entered into an agreement with an unrelated third party (the Purchaser) for the factoring of specific accounts receivable of a foreign subsidiary. The factoring of accounts receivable under this agreement does not meet the criteria for recognition as a sale in accordance with SFAS 140. Under the terms of the agreement, we transfer ownership of eligible accounts receivable to the Purchaser in exchange for cash, however, as the transaction does not qualify as a sale, the relating accounts receivable are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet until the cash is received by the Purchaser from our customer for the accounts receivable. Accordingly, we have a liability of $8.4 million recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at August 31, 2007 related to cash that has been received by the Company from the Purchaser for specific accounts receivable, but for which our customer has not remitted payment yet. Due to the delay in filing our Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2006 and Form 10 Q for the periods ended November 30, 2006 and February 28, 2007 we obtained all of the necessary covenant waivers for all material debt instruments entered into by the Company. As a result of the Companys filing of its Annual Report on Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2006, as well as the filing of the Companys Forms 10 Q for the fiscal quarters ended November 30, 2006 and February 28, 2007 the Company was in compliance with all covenants as of August 31, 2007. At August 31, 2007, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash, available borrowings under our credit facilities and our accounts receivable securitization program. Our working capital requirements and capital expenditures could continue to increase in order to support future expansions of our operations through construction of greenfield operations or acquisitions. It is possible that future expansions may be significant and may require the payment of cash. Future liquidity needs will also depend on fluctuations in levels of inventory and shipments, changes in customer order volumes and timing of expenditures for new equipment. We currently anticipate that during the next twelve months, our capital expenditures will be in the range of $300.0 million to $350.0 million, principally for machinery and equipment across all segments, expansion of existing manufacturing sites and the completion of new manufacturing sites in Eastern Europe, Asia and India and for information technology infrastructure. We believe that our level of resources, which include cash on hand, available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, additional proceeds available under our accounts receivable securitization program and funds provided by operations, will be adequate to fund these capital expenditures, the payment of any declared quarterly dividends, the payment of approximately $31.7 million for current restructuring activities, and our working capital requirements for the next twelve months. We entered into a merger agreement on November 22, 2006 with Green Point pursuant to which Green Point agreed to merge with and into an existing Jabil entity in Taiwan. The legal merger was effective on April 24, 2007. The legal merger was primarily achieved through a tender offer that we made to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of Green Point for 109.0 New Taiwan dollars per share. The tender offer was launched on November 23, 2006 and remained open for a period of 50 days. During the tender offer period, we acquired approximately 260.9 million shares, representing 97.6% of the outstanding shares of Green Point. On January 16, 2007, we paid cash of approximately $870.7 million (in U.S. dollars) to acquire the tendered shares. Subsequent to the completion of the tender offer and prior to the completion of the acquisition, we acquired approximately 2.1 million Green Point shares in block trades for a price of 109.0 New Taiwan dollars per share (or an approximate total of $7.0 million in U.S. dollars). On April 24, 2007, pursuant to the November 22, 2006 merger agreement, we acquired the approximately 4.1 million remaining outstanding Green Point shares that were not tendered during the tender offer period, for 109.0 New Taiwan dollars per share (or an approximate total of 62 Table of Contents $13.3 million in U.S. dollars). In total, we paid a total cash amount of approximately $891.0 million in U.S. dollars to complete the merger with Green Point. As discussed above, to fund the acquisition, we entered into a $1.0 billion Bridge Facility on December 21, 2006. See Note 7 Business Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. We recorded a minority interest in our Consolidated Financial Statements from January 16, 2007 through April 24, 2007 related to the remaining 2.4% of Green Point outstanding shares that we acquired on April 24, 2007. Should we desire to consummate significant additional acquisition opportunities or undertake significant additional expansion activities, our capital needs would increase and could possibly result in our need to increase available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities or access public or private debt and equity markets. There can be no assurance, however, that we would be successful in raising additional debt or equity on terms that we would consider acceptable. Our contractual obligations for short and long term debt arrangements, future interest on notes payable and long term debt, future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating lease arrangements and estimated future benefit plan payments as of August 31, 2007 are summarized below. We do not participate in, or secure financing for any unconsolidated limited purpose entities. We generally do not enter into non cancelable purchase orders for materials until we receive a corresponding purchase commitment from our customer. Non cancelable purchase orders do not typically extend beyond the normal lead time of several weeks at most. Purchase orders beyond this time frame are typically cancelable.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Currency Exchange Risks We transact business in various foreign countries and are, therefore, subject to risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We enter into forward contracts to economically hedge transactional exposure associated with commitments arising from trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable and fixed purchase obligations denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective operating entity. All derivative instruments are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their respective fair market values in accordance with SFAS 133. The Company has elected not to prepare and maintain the documentation required to qualify as an accounting hedge and, therefore, changes in fair value are recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The aggregate notional amount of outstanding contracts at August 31, 2007 was $1.2 billion. The fair value of these contracts amounted to a $4.7 million asset recorded in prepaid and other current assets and a $2.1 million liability recorded in accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The forward contracts will generally expire in less than four months, with five months being the maximum term of the contracts outstanding at August 31, 2007. The forward contracts will settle in British pounds, Chinese yuan renminbi, Euro dollars, Hong Kong dollars, Hungarian forints, Japanese yen, Malaysian ringgits, Mexican pesos, Singapore dollars, Swedish krona, Taiwanese dollars and U.S. dollars. We entered into several individual Taiwanese dollar foreign currency swap arrangements in connection with our tender offer for Green Point. These New Taiwan dollar foreign currency swap arrangements had a notional value of 17.0 billion New Taiwan dollars as of August 31, 2007 (approximately $513.9 million based on currency exchange rates at August 31, 2007) and the related non deliverable forward contracts had a notional value of 10.0 billion New Taiwan dollars as of August 31, 2007 (approximately $303.0 million based on currency exchange rates at August 31, 2007). Interest Rate Risk A portion of our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our domestic investment portfolio. We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. We place cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions. We protect our invested principal funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk. We mitigate default risk by generally investing in investment grade securities and by frequently positioning the portfolio to try to respond appropriately to a reduction in credit rating of any investment issuer, guarantor or depository to levels below the credit ratings dictated by our investment policy. The portfolio typically includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. At August 31, 2007, we had no outstanding investments. We pay interest on outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facilities at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base interest rates. These facilities include our Revolving Credit Facility, our short term Indian working capital facility, our Indian credit facilities and our Japanese financing facility. There were $425.4 million in borrowings outstanding under these revolving credit facilities at August 31, 2007. We pay interest on outstanding borrowings under our $1.0 billion Bridge Facility and our 25.0 million Euro loan agreement for a Hungarian subsidiary at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base interest rates. There were borrowings of $400.0 million and 15.8 million Euros (approximately $21.6 million based on currency exchange rates at August 31, 2007) outstanding, respectively under these loan agreements at August 31, 2007. We pay interest on outstanding borrowings we assumed as a result of the Green Point acquisition at both fixed and variable rates. At August 31, 2007, approximately $4.7 million of debt is outstanding under short term facilities, with current interest rates ranging from 2.8% to 6.0%. At August 31, 2007, approximately $57.4 million of debt is outstanding under long term facilities, with current interest rates ranging from 1.0% to 3.9%. 64 Table of Contents In July 2007, we entered into forward starting interest rate swap transactions to effectively lock in the July 2007 fixed interest rate for an anticipated debt issuance. The swaps are accounted for as a cash flow hedge under SFAS 133. Under the terms of the swaps, we will pay a fixed rate and will receive a variable rate based on the three month USD LIBOR rate plus a credit spread. The notional amount of the swaps is $400.0 million and the swaps will be terminated no later then November 2007. At August 31, 2007 the fair value of the swaps of $11.8 million was recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet in current liabilities with the corresponding offset recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income net of taxes. An increase or decrease of 50 basis points in the USD LIBOR interest rate of the forward swaps by November 2007 would result in a change of approximately $16.0 million in the fair market value of the swaps. Based on our ability to use hedge accounting, all changes in the fair market value of the swaps will be offset by a corresponding increase or decrease to accumulated other comprehensive income. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Risk Factors We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our international operations, which may be subject to a number of risks and often require more management time and expense to achieve profitability than our domestic operations, and An adverse change in the interest rates for our borrowings could adversely affect our financial condition.
