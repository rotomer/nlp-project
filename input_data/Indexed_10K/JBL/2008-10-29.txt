Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We are one of the leading providers of worldwide electronic manufacturing services and solutions. We provide comprehensive electronics design, production, product management and aftermarket services to companies in the aerospace, automotive, computing, consumer, defense, industrial, instrumentation, medical, networking, peripherals, storage and telecommunications industries. The industry in which we operate is composed of companies that provide a range of manufacturing and design services to companies that utilize electronics components in their products. The industry experienced rapid change and growth through the 1990s as an increasing number of companies chose to outsource an increasing portion, and, in some cases, all of their manufacturing requirements. In mid 2001, the industrys revenue declined as a result of significant cut backs in customer production requirements, which was consistent with the overall global economic downturn at the time. In response to this industry and global economic downturn, we implemented a restructuring program to reduce our cost structure and further align our manufacturing capacity with the geographic production demands of our customers. During the third quarter of our 2001 fiscal year, we implemented a restructuring program to reduce our cost structure due to the global economic downturn. This restructuring program included reductions in workforce, re sizing of facilities and the transition of certain facilities into new customer development sites. The macroeconomic conditions for us, and the electronic manufacturing services industry as a whole, continued to deteriorate during our 2002 fiscal year, resulting in additional restructuring programs being implemented during our 2002 fiscal year. These restructuring programs included reductions in workforce, re sizing of facilities and the closure of facilities. Industry revenues generally began to stabilize in 2003 and companies continued to turn to outsourcing versus internal manufacturing. During our 2006 fiscal year we initiated a restructuring program to realign our manufacturing capacity in certain higher cost geographies and to properly size our manufacturing sites with perceived market conditions. Over the past four years we have made concentrated efforts to diversify our industry sectors and customer base through acquisitions and organic growth. We believe further growth opportunities exist for the industry to penetrate the worldwide electronics markets. The rate of growth, however, of gross domestic product in the U.S. has recently declined. While recent economic conditions have not yet had a material negative impact on our results of operations, they may have such an impact over the next several fiscal quarters and possibly beyond. On September 1, 2007, we reorganized our manufacturing business into a Consumer division and an Electronic Manufacturing Services (EMS) division. Based on this reorganization, we currently have three operating segments Consumer, EMS and Aftermarket Services (AMS). We believe that these divisions provide cost effective solutions for our customers by grouping business units with similar needs together into divisions, each with full accountability for design, operations, supply chain management and delivery. Our AMS division provides warranty and repair services to customers in a broad range of industries, including certain of our manufacturing customers. Our Consumer division has dedicated resources designed to meet the particular needs of the consumer products industry and focuses on cell phones and mobile products, televisions, set top boxes and peripheral products such as printers. Our EMS division focuses on the traditional and emerging electronic manufacturing services business sectors, including automotive, computing, defense and aerospace, industrial, medical, networking, storage and telecommunications businesses. See Financial Information about Business Segments below. We derive revenue principally from the product sales of electronic equipment built to customer specifications. We recognize revenue, net of estimated product return costs, generally when goods are shipped, title and risk of ownership have passed, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and recoverability is reasonably assured. The volume and timing of orders placed by our customers vary due to several factors, including: variation in demand for our customers products; our customers attempts to manage their inventory; electronic design changes; changes in our customers manufacturing strategies; and acquisitions of or consolidations among our customers. Demand for our customers products depends on, among other things, product life cycles, competitive conditions and general economic conditions. 40 Table of Contents Our cost of revenue includes the cost of electronic components and other materials that comprise the products we manufacture; the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead; and adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory. As a provider of turnkey manufacturing services, we are responsible for procuring components and other materials. This requires us to commit significant working capital to our operations and to manage the purchasing, receiving, inspection and stocking of materials. Although we bear the risk of fluctuations in the cost of materials and excess scrap, we periodically negotiate cost of materials adjustments with our customers. Net revenue from each product that we manufacture consists of an element based on the costs of materials in that product and an element based on the labor and manufacturing overhead costs allocated to that product. We refer to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on materials costs as material based revenue, and to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on labor and manufacturing overhead costs as manufacturing based revenue. Our gross margin for any product depends on the mix between the cost of materials in the product and the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead allocated to the product. We typically realize higher gross margins on manufacturing based revenue than we do on materials based revenue. As we gain experience in manufacturing a product, we usually achieve increased efficiencies, which result in lower labor and manufacturing overhead costs for that product. Our operating results are impacted by the level of capacity utilization of manufacturing facilities; indirect labor costs; and selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high production volume and high capacity utilization. During periods of low production volume, we generally have idle capacity and reduced operating income margins. As our capacity has grown during recent years through the construction of new greenfield facilities, the expansion of existing facilities and our acquisition of additional facilities, our selling, general and administrative expenses have increased to support this growth. We have consistently utilized advanced circuit design, production design and manufacturing technologies to meet the needs of our customers. To support this effort, our engineering staff focuses on developing and refining design and manufacturing technologies to meet specific needs of specific customers. Most of the expenses associated with these customer specific efforts are reflected in our cost of revenue. In addition, our engineers engage in R&D of new technologies that apply generally to our operations. The expenses of these R&D activities are reflected in the Research and Development line item in our Consolidated Statement of Earnings. An important element of our strategy is the expansion of our global production facilities. The majority of our revenue and materials costs worldwide are denominated in U.S. dollars, while our labor and utility costs in plants outside the U.S. are denominated in local currencies. We economically hedge these local currency costs, based on our evaluation of the potential exposure as compared to the cost of the hedge, through the purchase of foreign exchange contracts. Changes in the fair market value of such hedging instruments are reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. See Risk Factors We are subject to risks of currency fluctuations and related hedging operations. We currently depend, and expect to continue to depend, upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue. A significant reduction in sales to any of our large customers or a customer exerting significant pricing and margin pressures on us would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In the past, some of our customers have terminated their manufacturing arrangements with us or have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of manufacturing services ordered from us. There can be no assurance that present or future customers will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us or significantly change, reduce or delay the amount of manufacturing services ordered from us. Any such termination of a manufacturing relationship or change, reduction or delay in orders could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. See Risk Factors Because we depend on a limited number of customers, a reduction in sales to any one of our customers could cause a significant decline in our revenue and Note 13 Concentration of Risk and Segment Data to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 Table of Contents Summary of Results Net revenue for fiscal year 2008 increased approximately 4.0% to $12.8 billion compared to $12.3 billion for fiscal year 2007. The increase in our net revenue base year over year primarily represents stronger market share with our existing programs, organic growth from new and existing customers as vertical companies continue to convert to an outsourcing model, and additional sales related to certain recent business acquisitions. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Acquisitions and Expansion and Note 7 Business Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our recent business acquisitions. Additionally, we continue to enhance our business model by adding services in the areas of collaborative design, system integration, order fulfillment and aftermarket. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan to better align our manufacturing capacity in certain higher cost geographies and to properly size our manufacturing sites with perceived current market conditions (the 2006 Restructuring Plan). Based on the analysis completed to date, we currently expect to recognize approximately $250.0 million in restructuring and impairment charges as a result of the 2006 Restructuring Plan. The restructuring charges include pre tax employee severance and benefit costs, contract termination costs and other related restructuring costs. The impairment charges include pre tax fixed asset impairment costs, as well as valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets. We have substantially completed our restructuring activities under the 2006 Restructuring Plan and currently expect to recognize the remaining costs over the course of fiscal year 2009 with certain contract termination costs to be incurred through fiscal year 2011. This information will be subject to the finalization of the timetables for the transitional functions, consultation with employees and their representatives, as well as the statutory severance requirements of the particular legal jurisdictions impacted. For further discussion of this restructuring program and the restructuring and impairment costs recognized, refer to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Restructuring and Impairment Charges and Note 10 Restructuring and Impairment Charges to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Risk Factors We face risks arising from the restructuring of our operations. The following table sets forth, for the fiscal year ended August 31, certain key operating results and other financial information (in thousands, except per share data). Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2008 2007 2006 Net revenue $ 12,779,703 $ 12,290,592 $ 10,265,447 Gross profit $ 867,801 $ 812,030 $ 764,900 Operating income $ 251,397 $ 181,939 $ 241,807 Net income $ 133,892 $ 73,236 $ 164,518 Basic earnings per share $ 0.65 $ 0.36 $ 0.79 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.65 $ 0.35 $ 0.77 Key Performance Indicators Management regularly reviews financial and non financial performance indicators to assess the Companys operating results. The following table sets forth, for the quarterly periods indicated, certain of managements key financial performance indicators. Three Months Ended August 31,2008 May 31,2008 February 29,2008 November 30,2007 Sales cycle 20 days 21 days 23 days 22 days Inventory turns 8 turns 8 turns 8 turns 8 turns Days in accounts receivable 40 days 39 days 39 days 42 days Days in inventory 45 days 47 days 47 days 42 days Days in accounts payable 65 days 65 days 63 days 62 days 42 Table of Contents Three Months Ended August 31,2007 May 31,2007 February 28,2007 November 30,2006 Sales cycle 19 days 25 days 29 days 23 days Inventory turns 8 turns 8 turns 7 turns 8 turns Days in accounts receivable 39 days 40 days 41 days 42 days Days in inventory 43 days 47 days 50 days 46 days Days in accounts payable 63 days 62 days 62 days 65 days The sales cycle is calculated as the sum of days in accounts receivable and days in inventory, less the days in accounts payable; accordingly, the variance in the sales cycle quarter over quarter is a direct result of changes in these indicators. Days in accounts receivable increased one day to 40 days during the three months ended August 31, 2008 from the prior sequential quarter which was primarily due to timing of sales and cash collection efforts during the quarter. Days in accounts receivable remained consistent at 39 days during the three months ended May 31, 2008 from the prior sequential quarter. During the three months ended February 29, 2008, days in accounts receivable decreased three days to 39 days from the prior sequential quarter and during the three months ended November 30, 2007 days in accounts receivable increased three days to 42 days from the prior sequential quarter. Both of these fluctuations were a result of timing of sales and cash collection efforts during the quarter, as well as related seasonality factors. Days in inventory decreased two days to 45 days during the three months ended August 31, 2008 from the prior sequential quarter as a result of improved inventory management. Days in inventory remained consistent at 47 days during the three months ended May 31, 2008 from the prior sequential quarter. During the three months ended February 29, 2008, days in inventory increased five days to 47 days due to decreased sales during the quarter resulting from seasonality factors in our consumer sector and delays in customer demand which had been scheduled during future quarters. Days in inventory decreased one day to 42 days during the three months ended November 30, 2007. The decrease in days in inventory was primarily a result of increased sales during the quarter and related seasonality factors. Inventory turns remained consistent at eight turns during all of the fiscal year 2008 periods. Days in accounts payable remained consistent at 65 days during the three months ended August 31, 2008 from the prior sequential quarter. Days in accounts payable increased two days to 65 days during the three months ended May 31, 2008 from the prior sequential quarter, increased one day to 63 days during the three months ended February 29, 2008 from the prior sequential quarter and decreased one day to 62 days during the three months ended November 30, 2007 from the prior sequential quarter. These fluctuations in days in accounts payables during fiscal year 2008 were primarily a result of timing of purchases and cash payments for purchases during the respective quarters. The sales cycle was 19 days during the three months ended August 31, 2007 and was 20 days during the three months ended August 31, 2008. This increase was due to changes in accounts receivable, accounts payable and inventory that are discussed above. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. Management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances. We have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. For further discussion of our significant accounting policies, refer to Note 1 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 43 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition We derive revenue principally from the product sales of electronic equipment built to customer specifications. We also derive revenue to a lesser extent from aftermarket services, design services and excess inventory sales. Revenue from product sales and excess inventory sales is generally recognized, net of estimated product return costs, when goods are shipped; title and risk of ownership have passed; the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and recoverability is reasonably assured. Aftermarket service related revenue is recognized upon completion of the services. Design service related revenue is generally recognized upon completion and acceptance by the respective customer. We assume no significant obligations after product shipment. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts related to receivables not expected to be collected from our customers. This allowance is based on managements assessment of specific customer balances, considering the age of receivables and financial stability of the customer. If there is an adverse change in the financial condition and circumstances of our customers, or if actual defaults are higher than provided for, an addition to the allowance may be necessary. Inventory Valuation We purchase inventory based on forecasted demand and record inventory at the lower of cost or market. Management regularly assesses inventory valuation based on current and forecasted usage and other lower of cost or market considerations. If actual market conditions or our customers product demands are less favorable than those projected, additional valuation adjustments may be necessary. Long Lived Assets We review property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of property, plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the undiscounted projected future cash flows that the asset(s) are expected to generate. If the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the long lived asset over its respective fair value, which is generally determined as the present value of estimated future cash flows or at the appraised value. The impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management, including revenue and cash flow projections. Circumstances that may lead to impairment of property, plant and equipment include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand and the restructuring of our operations resulting from a change in our business strategy. For further discussion of our current restructuring program, refer to Note 10 Restructuring and Impairment Charges to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Restructuring and Impairment Charges. We have recorded intangible assets, including goodwill, in connection with business acquisitions. Estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are determined by management based on an assessment of the period over which the asset is expected to contribute to future cash flows. The allocation of amortizable intangible assets impacts the amounts allocable to goodwill. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), we perform a goodwill impairment test using a two step method on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level, which the Company has determined to be consistent with its operating segments as defined in Note 13 Concentration of Risk and Segment Data to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The recoverability of goodwill is determined by comparing the reporting units carrying 44 Table of Contents amount, including goodwill, to the fair market value of the reporting unit, based on projected discounted future results and comparative market multiples. The use of comparative market multiples (the market approach) compares our company to other comparable companies based on valuation multiples to arrive at a fair value. We regularly compare our company and our divisions to our competitors and we believe the judgments used to arrive at these comparable companies are reasonable. The use of projected discounted future results (discounted cash flow approach) is based on assumptions that are consistent with our best estimates of future growth and the strategic plan used to manage the underlying business. Factors requiring significant judgment include the identification of reporting units, allocation of related goodwill, the assignment of corporate assets and liabilities to reporting units, future growth rates, discount factors and tax rates, amongst other considerations. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairment in future periods. We completed the annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 and determined that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test. Restructuring and Impairment Charges We have recognized restructuring and impairment charges related to reductions in workforce, re sizing and closure of facilities, and the transition of production from certain facilities into other new and existing facilities. These charges were recorded pursuant to formal plans developed and approved by management. The recognition of restructuring and impairment charges requires that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature, timing and amount of costs associated with these plans. The estimates of future liabilities may change, requiring additional restructuring and impairment charges or the reduction of liabilities already recorded. At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with the restructuring programs. For further discussion of our restructuring programs, refer to Note 10 Restructuring and Impairment Charges to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Restructuring and Impairment Charges. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We have pension and postretirement benefit costs and liabilities, which are developed from actuarial valuations. Actuarial valuations require management to make certain judgments and estimates of discount rates, compensation rate increases and return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions on a regular basis taking into consideration current market conditions and historical market data. The discount rate is used to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date. This rate represents the market rate for high quality fixed income investments. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. When considering the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets, we take into account current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on plan assets. Other assumptions include demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover. For further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefits, refer to Note 9 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes We estimate our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, a process that includes estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities. We must also make judgments regarding the ability to realize the deferred tax assets. The carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets that we do not believe meet the more likely than not criteria established by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). Our judgments regarding future taxable income may change due to changes in market conditions, changes in tax laws or other factors. If our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future, the valuation allowances we have established may be increased or decreased, resulting in a respective increase or decrease in either income tax expense or goodwill. 45 Table of Contents In June of 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. For further discussion related to our income taxes, refer to Note 4 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Stock Based Compensation In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), Share Based Payments (SFAS 123R) and the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107), we began recognizing stock based compensation expense in our consolidated statement of earnings on September 1, 2005. The fair value of options granted prior to September 1, 2005 were valued using the Black Scholes model while the stock appreciation rights granted after this date were valued using a lattice valuation model. Option pricing models require the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the option or stock appreciation right, risk free rate, expected dividend yield and the price volatility of the underlying stock. Judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock awards that are expected to vest as a result of satisfaction of time based vesting schedules or the achievement of certain performance conditions. If actual results or future changes in estimates differ significantly from our current estimates, stock based compensation could increase or decrease. For further discussion of our stock based compensation, refer to Note 12 Stockholders Equity to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Risk Factors We are involved in reviews of our historical stock option grant practices. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 15 New Accounting Pronouncements to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion on recent accounting pronouncements. Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain consolidated statement of earnings data as a percentage of net revenue: Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2008 2007 2006 Net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenue 93.2 93.4 92.5 Gross profit 6.8 6.6 7.5 Selling, general and administrative 3.8 4.0 3.7 Research and development 0.3 0.3 0.4 Amortization of intangibles 0.3 0.2 0.2 Restructuring and impairment charges 0.4 0.6 0.8 Operating income 2.0 1.5 2.4 Other expense 0.1 0.1 0.1 Interest income (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.2 ) Interest expense 0.8 0.7 0.3 Income before income taxes and minority interest 1.2 0.8 2.2 Income tax expense 0.2 0.2 0.6 Minority interest, net of tax 0.0 0.0 Net income 1.0 % 0.6 % 1.6 % 46 Table of Contents Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2008 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2007 Net Revenue. Our net revenue increased 4.0% to $12.8 billion for fiscal year 2008, up from $12.3 billion in fiscal year 2007. The increase in our net revenue base year over year primarily represents stronger market share with our existing programs, organic growth from new and existing customers as vertical companies continue to convert to an outsourcing model, and additional sales related to certain recent business acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by decreased levels of production with a major customer in the mobility sector and reduced demand in certain other sectors due to a softening market. See Note 7 Business Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion on our recent business acquisitions. Specific increases include a 40% increase in the sale of telecommunication products; a 20% increase in the sale of peripheral products; a 16% increase in the sale of other products; a 13% increase in aftermarket services; a 12% increase in the sale of networking products; and a 12% increase in the sale of computing and storage products. Specific decreases include a 23% decrease in the sale of mobility products; a 6% decrease in the sale of automotive products; a 5% decrease in the sale of display products; and a 1% decrease in the sale of instrumentation and medical products. A portion of our net revenue increase is attributable to businesses we acquire. Generally, we assess revenue on a global customer basis regardless of whether the growth is associated with organic growth or as a result of an acquisition. Accordingly, we do not differentiate or report separately revenue increases generated by acquisitions as opposed to existing business. In addition, the added cost structures associated with our acquisitions have historically been relatively insignificant when compared to our overall cost structure. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, revenue by industry sector expressed as a percentage of net revenue. The distribution of revenue across our industry sectors has fluctuated, and will continue to fluctuate, as a result of numerous factors, including but not limited to the following: increased business from new and existing customers; fluctuations in customer demand; seasonality, especially in the automotive and consumer industry sectors; and increased growth in the automotive, consumer, and instrumentation and medical products industry sectors as more vertical companies are electing to outsource their production in these areas. Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2008 2007 2006 EMS Automotive 4 % 5 % 5 % Computing and storage 13 % 11 % 11 % Instrumentation and medical 18 % 19 % 20 % Networking 21 % 20 % 13 % Telecommunications 6 % 5 % 6 % Other 2 % 2 % 1 % Total EMS 64 % 62 % 56 % Consumer Display 7 % 8 % 8 % Mobility 12 % 16 % 21 % Peripherals 12 % 10 % 11 % Total Consumer 31 % 34 % 40 % AMS 5 % 4 % 4 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 47 Table of Contents Foreign source revenue represented 79.6% of our net revenue for fiscal year 2008 and 78.8% of net revenue for fiscal year 2007. We currently expect our foreign source revenue to slightly increase as a percentage of net revenue over the course of fiscal year 2009 due to expansion in Asia and Eastern Europe. Gross Profit. Gross profit increased to $867.8 million (6.8% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2008 from $812.0 million (6.6% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2007. The percentage increase from the prior fiscal year was partially due to factors that decreased gross profit in fiscal year 2007, but have since been resolved. The factors that contributed to decreased gross profit in fiscal year 2007 included inefficiencies in our consumer model which adversely impacted margins, shifting to a more integrated model with one customer and shifting to a more vertical solution that integrated our Green Point services for another significant customer. In addition, we have exited production of certain targeted products in the consumer sector. Selling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $491.3 million (3.8% of net revenue) from $492.0 million (4.0% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2007. The slight absolute dollar decrease was due to several factors including a $14.5 million decrease in legal and accounting expenses incurred during fiscal year 2007 related to the independent stock option review that was performed; a $14.0 million reversal of previously recognized stock based compensation expense as a result of a change in estimate related to performance based restricted stock awards that are no longer expected to vest; and a decrease of $4.9 million in stock based compensation expense incurred during fiscal year 2007 related to certain 2006 personal tax liabilities incurred by certain option holders who have exercised Section 409A affected options as defined under Internal Revenue Code Section 409A. These decreases were offset by an increase of $7.4 million as a result of Green Point being consolidated for a full year in fiscal year 2008; an increase of $13.1 million related to the NSN acquisition; and an increase of $13.1 million stock based compensation expense associated with our annual grant of stock based awards to employees. R&D. R&D expenses for fiscal year 2008 decreased to $33.0 million (0.3% of net revenue) from $36.4 million (0.3% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2007. The decrease is attributed primarily to an increased level of customer funded design projects, along with the repositioning of certain design resources to lower cost regions. Amortization of Intangibles. We recorded $37.3 million of amortization of intangibles in fiscal year 2008 as compared to $29.3 million in fiscal year 2007. The increase was primarily attributable to amortization of intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions consummated in fiscal year 2007, offset by certain fully amortized intangible assets. For additional information regarding purchased intangibles, see Acquisitions and Expansion below, Note 1(f) Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Note 6 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Note 7 Business Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Restructuring and Impairment Charges. As mentioned in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Summary of Results, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, we initiated the 2006 Restructuring Plan. We have substantially completed restructuring activities and expect to incur the remaining costs over the course of fiscal year 2009 with certain contract termination costs to be incurred through fiscal year 2011. For fiscal year 2008, the 2006 Restructuring Plan resulted in restructuring and impairment charges of $54.8 million consisting of employee severance and benefit costs of approximately $46.7 million, costs related to lease commitments of approximately $7.3 million, fixed asset impairments of approximately $0.3 million and other restructuring costs of approximately $0.5 million. For fiscal year 2007, the 2006 Restructuring Plan resulted in restructuring and impairment charges of $72.4 million, consisting of employee severance and benefit costs of approximately $31.3 million, costs related to lease commitments of approximately $2.7 million, fixed asset impairments of approximately $45.6 million and other restructuring costs of approximately $1.1 million, offset by $8.3 million of proceeds received in connection with facility closure costs. 48 Table of Contents Through August 31, 2008, the 2006 Restructuring Plan has resulted in restructuring and impairment charges of $209.1 million. These charges include cash costs totaling $160.2 million, of which $1.5 million was paid in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2006, $64.8 million was paid in fiscal year 2007 and $57.2 million was paid in fiscal year 2008. The cash costs consist of employee severance and benefits costs of approximately $146.4 million, costs related to lease commitments of approximately $20.0 million and other restructuring costs of $2.1 million. These cash costs were offset by $8.3 million of cash proceeds received in connection with a facility closure. Non cash costs of approximately $48.9 million primarily represent fixed asset impairment charges related to our restructuring activities. At August 31, 2008, liabilities of approximately $35.2 million related to these restructurings activities are expected to be paid out in fiscal year 2009. The remaining liability of $5.3 million is related to certain lease commitments and employee severance and termination benefit payments and is expected to be paid out primarily during fiscal years 2009 through 2011. As of August 31, 2008, as a result of the restructuring activities completed through August 31, 2008 related to the 2006 Restructuring Plan, we expect to avoid annual costs of approximately $151.5 million that would otherwise have been incurred if the restructuring activities had not been completed. The expected avoided annual costs consist of a reduction in employee related expenses of approximately $137.7 million, a reduction in depreciation expense associated with impaired fixed assets of approximately $8.5 million, and a reduction in rent expense associated with leased buildings that have been vacated of approximately $5.3 million. The majority of these annual cost savings will be reflected as a reduction in cost of revenue, with a small portion being reflected as a reduction in selling, general and administrative expense. These annual costs savings are expected to be offset by decreased revenues associated with certain products that are approaching the end of life stage; decreased revenues as a result of shifting production to plants located in lower cost regions where competitive environmental pressures require that we pass those cost savings onto our customers; and incremental employee related costs expected to be incurred by those plants to which the production will be shifted. After considering these cost savings offsets, we currently expect to realize net annualized cost savings of approximately $30.0 to $40.0 million by the second half of fiscal year 2009. For further discussion of the current restructuring program, see Overview Summary of Results above, and Note 10 Restructuring and Impairment Charges to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Expense. We recorded other expense on the sale of accounts receivable under our North American securitization program totaling $11.9 million and $15.9 million for the fiscal years ending August 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in other expense was primarily due to a decrease in the amount of receivables sold under the program during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2008. For further discussion of our accounts receivable securitization program, see Note 2 Accounts Receivable Securitizations to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest Income. Interest income decreased to $12.0 million in fiscal year 2008 from $14.5 million in fiscal year 2007. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest yields on operating cash, cash deposits and cash equivalents. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $94.3 million in fiscal year 2008 from $86.1 million in fiscal year 2007. The increase was primarily a result of higher overall average debt levels due to acquisition related debt being outstanding for a full fiscal year. Income Taxes. Income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of 16.0% for fiscal year 2008, as compared to an effective tax rate of 22.6% for fiscal year 2007. The decrease is primarily a result of increased income in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. The tax rate is predominantly a function of the mix of tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we do business. Our international operations have historically been taxed at a lower rate than in the U.S., primarily due to tax incentives, including tax holidays, granted to our sites in Brazil, China, Hungary, India, Malaysia and Poland that expire at various dates through 2017. Such tax holidays are subject to conditions with which we expect to continue to comply. See Risk Factors We are subject to the risk of increased taxes and Note 4 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 49 Table of Contents Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2007 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2006 Net Revenue. Our net revenue increased 19.7% to $12.3 billion for fiscal year 2007, up from $10.3 billion in fiscal year 2006. The increase was due to increased sales levels across most industry sectors, as well as additional sales related to certain recent business acquisitions. See Note 7 Business Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion on our recent business acquisitions. Specific increases include a 142% increase in the sale of other products; an 89% increase in the sale of networking products; a 42% increase in the sale of aftermarket services; a 20% increase in the sale of display products; a 20% increase in the sale of computing and storage products; a 15% increase in the sale of instrumentation and medical products; a 12% increase in the sale of peripheral products; and a 6% increase in the sale of automotive products. Specific decreases include a 12% decrease in the sale of telecommunication products and a 10% decrease in the sale of mobility products. The increased sales levels were due to the addition of new customers and organic growth in these industry sectors, as well as additional sales related to certain recent business acquisitions as discussed above. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, revenue by industry sector expressed as a percentage of net revenue. The distribution of revenue across our industry sectors has fluctuated, and will continue to fluctuate, as a result of numerous factors, including but not limited to the following: increased business from new and existing customers; fluctuations in customer demand; seasonality, especially in the automotive and consumer industry sectors; and increased growth in the automotive, consumer, and instrumentation and medical products industry sectors as more vertical companies are electing to outsource their production in these areas. Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2007 2006 EMS Automotive 5 % 5 % Computing and storage 11 % 11 % Instrumentation and medical 19 % 20 % Networking 20 % 13 % Telecommunications 5 % 6 % Other 2 % 1 % Total EMS 62 % 56 % Consumer Display 8 % 8 % Mobility 16 % 21 % Peripherals 10 % 11 % Total Consumer 34 % 40 % AMS 4 % 4 % Total 100 % 100 % Foreign source revenue represented 78.8% of our net revenue for fiscal year 2007 and 82.3% of net revenue for fiscal year 2006. Gross Profit. Gross profit decreased to 6.6% of net revenue in fiscal year 2007 from 7.5% in fiscal year 2006. The percentage decrease from the prior fiscal year was partially due to having a higher portion of materials based revenue, driven in part by growth in our networking sector. In addition, due to the inefficiencies in our current consumer model which has adversely impacted margins, we are shifting to a more integrated model with one customer and shifting to a more vertical solution that will integrate our Green Point services for another significant customer. In addition, we have exited production of targeted products in the consumer sector. 50 Table of Contents In absolute dollars, gross profit for fiscal year 2007 increased $47.1 million versus fiscal year 2006 due to the increased revenue base. Selling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $492.0 million (4.0% of net revenue) from $382.2 million (3.7% of net revenue) in fiscal year 2006. The absolute dollar increase was largely due to increased costs primarily in Eastern Europe and Asia to support our operational growth and expansion within those areas; the acquisition of Green Point in April 2007; incremental stock based compensation expense associated with our annual grant of stock based awards to employees; legal and accounting expenses incurred during fiscal year 2007 related to the independent stock option review that was performed; and incremental costs in fiscal year 2007 due to the acquisition of Celetronix in March 2006. R&D. R&D expenses in fiscal year 2007 increased to $36.4 million (0.3% of net revenue) from $35.0 million (0.4% of net revenue) in fiscal year 2006. The increase is attributed to growth in our product development activities related to new platform designs, including cell phone modules, wireless and broadband access products, consumer entertainment products, and enterprise storage products. We also continued efforts in new product technologies and the related production design processes; and the development of new advanced manufacturing technologies. Amortization of Intangibles. We recorded $29.3 million of amortization of intangibles in fiscal year 2007 as compared to $24.3 million in fiscal year 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to amortization of intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions consummated in fiscal year 2007, offset by certain fully amortized intangible assets. For additional information regarding purchased intangibles, see Acquisitions and Expansion below, Note 1(f) Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Note 6 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Note 7 Business Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Restructuring and Impairment Charges. As mentioned in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Summary of Results, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, we initiated the 2006 Restructuring Plan. During fiscal year 2007, the 2006 Restructuring Plan resulted in restructuring and impairment charges of $72.4 million, consisting of employee severance and benefit costs of approximately $31.3 million, costs related to lease commitments of approximately $2.7 million, fixed asset impairments of approximately $45.6 million and other restructuring costs of approximately $1.1 million, offset by $8.3 million of proceeds received in connection with facility closure costs. The 2006 Restructuring Plan resulted in restructuring and impairment charges of $81.9 million for fiscal year 2006 consisting of employee severance and benefit costs of approximately $67.4 million, costs related to lease commitments of approximately $10.1 million, fixed asset impairments of approximately $3.6 million and other restructuring costs of approximately $0.8 million, primarily related to the repayment of government provided subsidies that resulted from the reduction in force in certain locations. These restructuring and impairment charges related to the 2006 Restructuring Plan incurred through August 31, 2007 of $154.3 million include cash costs totaling $105.9 million, of which $1.5 million was paid in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2006 and $64.8 million was paid in fiscal year 2007. The cash costs consist of employee severance and benefits costs of approximately $99.8 million, costs related to lease commitments of approximately $12.9 million and other restructuring costs of $1.5 million. These cash costs were offset by approximately $8.3 million of cash proceeds received in connection with a facility closure. Non cash costs of approximately $48.4 million primarily represent fixed asset impairment charges related to our restructuring activities. 51 Table of Contents Additionally, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, we made the final cash payment related to our historical restructuring program. A liability balance of approximately $308.0 thousand remained after remittance of the final payment. This remaining liability was recorded as a reduction of the fiscal year 2006 restructuring charge. Other Expense. We recorded other expense on the sale of accounts receivable under our North American securitization program totaling $15.9 million and $11.9 million for the fiscal years ending August 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in other expense was primarily due to an increase in the amount of receivables sold under the program during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2007. For further discussion of our accounts receivable securitization program, see Note 2 Accounts Receivable Securitizations to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest Income. Interest income decreased to $14.5 million in fiscal year 2007 from $18.7 million in fiscal year 2006. The decrease was primarily due to lower levels of operating cash, cash deposits and cash equivalents due to the repayment of outstanding borrowings under our debt agreements. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $86.1 million in fiscal year 2007 from $23.5 million in fiscal year 2006. The increase was primarily a result of increased borrowings under the revolving credit portion of our Credit Facility, as well as borrowings under our Bridge Facility that was entered into on December 21, 2006, primarily to fund the tender offer and merger with Green Point. Income Taxes. Income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of 22.6% for fiscal year 2007, as compared to an effective tax rate of 26.9% for fiscal year 2006. The decrease is primarily a result of the absence of tax expense associated with recording valuation allowances in fiscal year 2006 of $37.1 million on net deferred tax assets as a result of our restructuring plan. For further discussion of the restructuring plan, see Note 10 Restructuring and Impairment Charges to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The tax rate is predominantly a function of the mix of tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we do business. Our international operations have historically been taxed at a lower rate than in the U.S., primarily due to tax incentives, including tax holidays, granted to our sites in Brazil, China, Hungary, India, Malaysia and Poland that expire at various dates through 2017. Such tax holidays are subject to conditions with which we expect to continue to comply. See Note 4 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 52 Table of Contents Quarterly Results (Unaudited) The following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly financial information for the 2008 and 2007 fiscal years. In the opinion of management, this information has been presented on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere, and all necessary adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the unaudited quarterly results when read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto.

(2) We received an $8.4 million reimbursement pursuant to an agreement with a company from which we previously purchased certain facilities in order to reimburse us for certain costs related to the closure of a manufacturing facility in Europe. As they relate to activities for which the revenues and expenses have historically been included in our operating income, we have reclassified these $8.4 million of proceeds from other income to restructuring and impairment charges on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. 53 Table of Contents The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain financial information stated as a percentage of net revenue: Fiscal Year 2008 Fiscal Year 2007 Aug. 31,2008 May 31,2008 Feb. 29,2008 Nov. 30,2007 Aug. 31,2007 May 31,2007 Feb. 28,2007 Nov. 30,2006 Net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenue 93.0 93.2 93.9 92.9 92.7 92.7 94.2 94.0 Gross profit 7.0 6.8 6.1 7.1 7.3 7.3 5.8 6.0 Selling, general and administrative 3.8 4.1 4.0 3.4 3.9 4.7 4.1 3.4 Research and development 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.2 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 Amortization of intangibles 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.2 0.2 Restructuring and impairment charges 0.0 0.1 1.4 0.3 1.2 0.8 0.0 0.2 Operating income 2.6 2.0 0.1 2.9 1.6 1.2 1.2 1.9 Other expense 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 Interest income (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.1 ) Interest expense 0.7 0.7 0.8 0.8 0.8 1.0 0.7 0.4 Income before income taxes and minority interest 1.9 1.3 (0.7 ) 2.1 0.8 0.2 0.5 1.5 Income tax (benefit) expense 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.3 0.4 0.0 0.1 0.2 Minority interest, net of tax 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Net income 1.8 % 1.2 % (0.8 )% 1.8 % 0.4 % 0.2 % 0.4 % 1.3 % Acquisitions and Expansion We have made a number of acquisitions that were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Our consolidated financial statements include the operating results of each business from the date of acquisition. See Risk Factors We may not achieve expected profitability from our acquisitions. For further discussion of our recent and planned acquisitions, see Note 7 Business Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We completed construction of our new manufacturing facilities in Uzhgorod, Ukraine in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 and in Huangpu, China in the second quarter of fiscal year 2008. We also completed construction of an additional facility in Chennai, India during the second quarter of fiscal year 2008 and commenced operations in this facility during the third quarter of fiscal year 2008. We completed construction of an expansion to our existing facilities in Kwidzyn, Poland during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 and Ranjangaon, India during the third quarter of fiscal year 2008. We began expansion to an existing facility in Penang, Malaysia in the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 and have substantially completed construction during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008. As discussed in Note 7 Business Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we entered into a merger agreement on November 22, 2006 with Green Point, pursuant to which Green Point agreed to merge with and into an existing Jabil entity in Taiwan. The legal merger was effective on April 24, 2007. The legal merger was primarily achieved through a tender offer that we made to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of Green Point for 109.0 New Taiwan dollars per share. The tender offer was launched on November 23, 2006 and remained open for a period of 50 days. During the tender offer period, we acquired approximately 260.9 million shares, representing 97.6% of the outstanding shares of Green Point. On January 16, 2007, we paid cash in the amount of approximately $870.7 million (in U.S. dollars) to acquire the tendered shares. Subsequent to the 54 Table of Contents completion of the tender offer and prior to the completion of the acquisition, we acquired approximately 2.1 million Green Point shares in block trades for a price of 109.0 New Taiwan dollars per share (or an approximate total of $7.0 million in U.S. dollars). On April 24, 2007, pursuant to the November 22, 2006 merger agreement, we acquired the approximately 4.1 million remaining outstanding Green Point shares that were not tendered during the tender offer period, for 109.0 New Taiwan dollars per share (or an approximate total of $13.3 million in U.S. dollars). In total, we paid a total cash amount of approximately $891.0 million in U.S. dollars to complete the merger with Green Point. To fund the acquisition, we entered into a $1.0 billion, 364 day senior unsecured bridge loan facility with a syndicate of banks on December 21, 2006. See Note 7 Business Acquisitions included in our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. The financial results of Green Point were included in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on January 16, 2007. We recorded a minority interest in our Consolidated Financial Statements from January 16, 2007 through April 24, 2007 related to the remaining 2.4% of Green Point outstanding shares that were acquired on April 24, 2007. On October 17, 2007, one of our Italian subsidiaries entered into an agreement to acquire certain manufacturing operations of Nokia Siemens Networks S.p.A. (NSN). The acquired manufacturing operations relate to two of NSNs existing facilities in Cassina de Pecchi and Marcianise, Italy. The agreement, which was effective November 1, 2007, includes the purchase of certain assets, including machinery, equipment and inventory, and the assumption of certain employee related liabilities. The parties also entered into a manufacturing agreement, pursuant to which we will continue to build products that are currently manufactured at these facilities. We acquired these manufacturing operations to enhance our global standing as a leading provider of telecommunications infrastructure hardware. See Note 7 Business Acquisitions included in our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Seasonality Production levels for our Consumer division and the automotive industry sector of our EMS division are subject to seasonal influences. We may realize greater net revenue during our first fiscal quarter due to high demand for consumer products during the holiday selling season. Liquidity and Capital Resources At August 31, 2008, we had cash and cash equivalent balances totaling $773.0 million, total notes payable, long term debt and capital lease obligations of $1.4 billion and $937.5 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facilities and amounts available under our accounts receivable securitization programs. The following table sets forth, for the fiscal year ended August 31 selected consolidated cash flow information (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2008 2007 2006 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 411,865 $ 183,889 $ 448,176 Net cash used in investing activities (384,720 ) (1,054,422 ) (417,470 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 93,137 715,140 (67,906 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (10,984 ) 45,455 14,692 Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 109,298 $ (109,938 ) $ (22,508 ) Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2008 was $411.9 million. This consisted primarily of $133.9 million of net income, $276.3 million of depreciation and amortization, $54.8 million of non cash restructuring charges, $36.4 million of non cash stock based compensation expense, increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $119.9 million, and increases in income taxes payable of $52.0 million. The increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was due primarily to the timing of purchases in the fourth 55 Table of Contents quarter of fiscal year 2008. The increase in income taxes payable was primarily due to additional unrecognized tax benefits being recorded and the timing of certain income tax payments. These sources of cash were partially offset by $67.4 million in deferred income taxes, a $27.6 million increase in inventory, a $60.8 million increase in accounts receivable, and a $92.7 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets. The increase in inventory was due primarily to the pre positioning of inventory in anticipation of forecasted first quarter demand. The increase in accounts receivable was due primarily to a reduction in the sale of receivables under our North American securitization program in the amount of $47.3 million. The increase in prepaid expenses and other assets primarily relates to the recording of a note receivable due from a customer. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2008 was $384.7 million. This consisted of net cash of $58.2 million primarily paid for the acquisition of certain manufacturing operations of NSN and our capital expenditures of $337.5 million for manufacturing and computer equipment to support our ongoing business across all segments and for expansion activities in Asia and Eastern Europe. These expenditures were partially offset by $11.0 million of proceeds from the sale of certain excess property, plant and equipment. Net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year 2008 was $93.1 million. This resulted from our receipt of approximately $4.5 billion of proceeds from borrowings under debt agreements, which primarily included an aggregate of $3.1 billion of borrowings under the revolving portion of the Credit Facility, $394.2 million of net proceeds from the 8.250% Senior Notes, and $364.3 million of borrowings under our short term Indian working capital facilities. In addition we obtained proceeds of $16.5 million upon the issuance of common stock under option plans and employee stock purchase plans. This was offset by approximately $4.4 billion of payments toward debt agreements during fiscal year 2008, which primarily included repayments of an aggregate of $3.1 billion of borrowings under the revolving portion of the Credit Facility, $400.0 million toward repayment of borrowings under the Bridge Facility, and $350.5 million toward repayment of borrowings under our short term Indian working capital facilities. In addition we paid $58.6 million of dividends to stockholders during fiscal year 2008. See Note 8 Notes Payable, Long Term Debt and Long Term Lease Obligations to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We may need to finance future growth and any corresponding working capital needs with additional borrowings under our revolving credit facilities described below, as well as additional public and private offerings of our debt and equity. Currently, we have approximately $855.0 million of securities registered with the SEC under our shelf registration statement. The Securities Act of 1933 (the Act) Offering Reform has significantly modified the registration and offering process under the Act. Promptly after filing this Annual Report on Form 10 K, as a result of our existing shelf registration statement expiring December 1, 2008, we anticipate terminating our existing shelf registration statement and filing a new shelf registration statement under these simplified registration procedures. The new shelf registration statement will register the potential sale of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities in the future, from time to time, to augment our liquidity and capital resources. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2004, we entered into our North American asset backed securitization program with a bank, which originally provided for net cash proceeds at any one time of an amount up to $100.0 million on the sale of eligible trade accounts receivable of certain domestic operations. Subsequent to fiscal year 2004, several amendments have increased the net cash proceeds available at any one time under the securitization program up to an amount of $280.0 million and extended the program until March 19, 2009. Under this agreement, we continuously sell a designated pool of trade accounts receivable to a wholly owned subsidiary, which in turn sells an ownership interest in the receivables to a conduit, administered by an unaffiliated financial institution. This wholly owned subsidiary is a separate bankruptcy remote entity and its assets would be available first to satisfy the claims of the conduit. As the receivables sold are collected, we are able to sell additional receivables up to the maximum permitted amount under the program. The securitization program requires compliance with several financial covenants including an interest coverage ratio and debt to EBITDA ratio, as defined in the securitization agreements, as amended. For each pool of eligible receivables sold to the conduit, we retain a percentage interest in the face value of the receivables, which is calculated based on 56 Table of Contents the terms of the agreement. Net receivables sold under this program are excluded from trade accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are reflected as cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. We continue to service, administer and collect the receivables sold under this program. We pay facility fees of 0.35% per annum of 102% of the average purchase limit and program fees of up to 0.275% of the average daily outstanding amounts. The investors and the securitization conduit have no recourse to our assets for failure of debtors to pay when due. As of August 31, 2008, we had sold $344.2 million of eligible trade accounts receivable, which represents the face amount of total outstanding receivables at that date. In exchange, we received cash proceeds of $242.0 million and retained an interest in the receivables of approximately $102.2 million. In connection with the securitization program, we recognized pretax losses on the sale of receivables of approximately $11.9 million, $15.9 million and $11.9 million during the fiscal years ended August 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, which are recorded as other expense on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2008, we entered into our foreign asset backed securitization program with a bank conduit. In connection with the securitization program certain foreign subsidiaries sell, on an ongoing basis, an undivided interest in designated pools of trade accounts receivable to a special purpose entity, which in turn borrows up to $200.0 million from the bank conduit to purchase those receivables and in which it grants security interests as collateral for the borrowings. The securitization program is accounted for as a borrowing under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities (a replacement of FASB Statement No. 125), (SFAS 140). The loan balance is calculated based on the terms of the securitization program agreements. The securitization program requires compliance with several covenants including a limitation on certain corporate actions such as mergers, consolidations and sale of substantially all assets. At August 31, 2008, we had $170.9 million of debt outstanding under the program. In addition, we incurred interest expense at a variable rate of approximately 3.9% plus a fixed spread during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2008 on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Our North American and foreign asset backed securitization programs expire on March 19, 2009 and April 6, 2009, respectively. While we have historically been able to renew such asset backed securitization programs on similar terms, market conditions at the time our current programs expire may prevent us from doing so. In such an event we would be required to seek other forms of borrowing on more acceptable terms, or increase our borrowing under the revolving credit portion of our Credit Facility, which would decrease our flexibility to make acquisitions and capital expenditures, and also decrease the amount otherwise available for general corporate purposes. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2005, we entered into an agreement with an unrelated third party for the factoring of specific trade accounts receivable of a foreign subsidiary. Under the terms of the factoring agreement, we transfer ownership of eligible trade accounts receivable without recourse to the third party purchaser in exchange for cash. Proceeds on the transfer reflect the face value of the account less a discount. The discount is recorded as a loss on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings in the period of the sale. The factoring agreement expired in April 2008 and was extended for a six month period. The receivables sold pursuant to this factoring agreement are excluded from trade accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are reflected as cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. We continue to service, administer and collect the receivables sold under this program. The third party purchaser has no recourse to our assets for failure of debtors to pay when due. At August 31, 2008, we had sold $29.4 million of trade accounts receivable, which represents the face amount of total outstanding receivables at that date. In exchange, we received cash proceeds of $29.4 million. The resulting loss on the sale of trade accounts receivable sold under this factoring agreement was $0.2 million, $0.2 million and $0.1 million for the fiscal years ended August 31 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 57 Table of Contents Notes payable, long term debt and long term lease obligations outstanding at August 31, 2008 and 2007 are summarized below (in thousands). August 31,2008 August 31,2007 5.875% Senior Notes due 2010 (a) $ 298,198 $ 297,215 8.250% Senior Notes due 2018 (b) 396,377 Short term factoring debt (c) 617 8,440 Borrowings under credit facilities (d) 55,579 42,421 Borrowings under loans (e) 423,064 446,663 Borrowings under unsecured bridge credit agreement (f) 400,000 Financing obligation related to sale leaseback transaction (g) 5,285 Green Point debt obligations (h) 24,583 62,140 Securitization program obligations (i) 170,975 Miscellaneous borrowings 17 29 Total notes payable, long term debt and long term lease obligations $ 1,369,410 $ 1,262,193 Less current installments of notes payable, long term debt and long term lease obligations 269,937 501,716 Notes payable, long term debt and long term lease obligations, less current installments $ 1,099,473 $ 760,477 (a) During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003, we issued a total of $300.0 million, seven year, 5.875% Senior Notes (the 5.875% Senior Notes) at 99.803% of par, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $297.2 million. The 5.875% Senior Notes were offered pursuant to our shelf registration statement. The 5.875% Senior Notes mature on July 15, 2010 and pay interest semiannually on January 15 and July 15. We are subject to covenants such as: limitation upon our consolidation, merger or sale; limitation upon our liens; limitation upon our sales and leasebacks; limitation upon our subsidiaries funded debt; limitation on guarantees given by our subsidiaries for our indebtedness; our corporate existence; reports; and compliance and notice requirements. In July 2003, we entered into an interest rate swap transaction to effectively convert the fixed interest rate of our 5.875% Senior Notes to a variable rate. The swap, which was to expire in 2010, was accounted for as a fair value hedge under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities (SFAS 133). The notional amount of the swap was $300.0 million, which is related to the 5.875% Senior Notes. Under the terms of the swap, we paid an interest rate equal to the six month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) set in arrears, plus a fixed spread of 1.945%. In exchange, we received a fixed rate of 5.875%. The swap transaction qualified for the shortcut method of recognition under SFAS 133, therefore no portion of the swap was treated as ineffective. The interest rate swap was terminated on June 3, 2005. The fair value of the interest rate swap of $4.5 million was recorded in long term liabilities, with the corresponding offset recorded as a decrease to the carrying value of the 5.875% Senior Notes, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at the termination date. In addition, we had recorded $0.4 million of interest receivable from the issuing bank as of the termination date. Upon termination, we made a net $4.1 million cash payment to the issuing bank to derecognize the interest rate swap and the accrued interest. The $4.5 million decrease to the carrying value of the 5.875% Senior Notes on the Consolidated Balance Sheet will be amortized to operations through interest expense over the remaining term of the debt. (b) During the second and third quarters of fiscal year 2008, we completed our offerings of $250.0 million and $150.0 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of 8.250% senior unsecured unregistered notes due March 15, 2018, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $245.7 million and $148.5 million, respectively. On June 18, 2008, we commenced an offer to exchange the outstanding unregistered 8.250% Notes for registered 8.250% Notes (collectively the 8.250% Senior Notes) that are substantially identical to the unregistered notes except that the 8.25% Senior Notes are registered under the Securities Act and do not have any transfer restrictions, registration rights or rights to additional special interest. Upon completion 58 Table of Contents of the exchange offer on July 18, 2008, all outstanding unregistered notes were exchanged. The 8.250% Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture dated as of January 16, 2008, by and between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly known as The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.), as trustee (the Indenture), as supplemented by the Officers Certificates dated January 16, 2008 and May 19, 2008, that were delivered by certain of our officers pursuant to Sections 1.2, 3.1 and 3.3 of the Indenture. The 8.250% Senior Notes will mature on March 15, 2018. Interest on the 8.250% Senior Notes is payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2008. The interest rate payable is subject to adjustment from time to time if the credit ratings assigned to the 8.250% Senior Notes increase or decrease, as provided in the 8.250% Senior Notes. The 8.250% Senior Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all other existing and future senior unsecured debt obligations. The Indenture contains certain covenants, including, but not limited to, covenants limiting our ability and or our subsidiaries ability to: create certain liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; create, incur, issue, assume or guarantee any funded debt (applicable only to our restricted subsidiaries); guarantee any of our indebtedness (applicable only to our subsidiaries); and consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to another person. The Indenture also contains a covenant regarding our repurchase of the 8.250% Senior Notes upon a change of control repurchase event. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, we entered into forward interest rate swap transactions to hedge the fixed interest rate payments for an anticipated debt issuance. The swaps are accounted for as a cash flow hedge under SFAS 133. The notional amount of the swaps was $400.0 million. Concurrently with the pricing of the first $250.0 million of the 8.250% Senior Notes, we settled $250.0 million of the swaps by our payment of $27.5 million. We also settled the remaining $150.0 million of swaps during the second quarter of fiscal year 2008 by our payment of $15.6 million. As a result, we settled the amount recognized as a current liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We also recorded $0.7 million in interest expense (as ineffectiveness) in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings during the three months ended February 29, 2008, with the remainder recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes, in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. On May 19, 2008, we issued the remaining $150.0 million of 8.250% Senior Notes and recorded no additional interest expense (as ineffectiveness) in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The effective portion of the swaps remaining on our Consolidated Balance Sheet will be amortized to interest expense on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings over the life of the 8.250% Senior Notes. (c) During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, we entered into an agreement with an unrelated third party (the Purchaser) for the factoring of specific trade accounts receivable of a foreign subsidiary. The factoring of trade accounts receivable under this agreement does not meet the criteria for recognition as a sale in accordance with SFAS 140. Under the terms of the agreement, we transfer ownership of eligible trade accounts receivable to the Purchaser in exchange for cash, however, as the transaction does not qualify as a sale, the relating trade accounts receivable are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet until the cash is received by the Purchaser from our customer for the trade accounts receivable. Accordingly, we have a liability of $0.6 million recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at August 31, 2008 related to cash that we have received from the Purchaser for specific trade accounts receivable, but for which our customer has not remitted payment yet. (d) Various of our foreign subsidiaries have entered into several credit facilities to finance their future growth and any corresponding working capital needs. These credit facilities are denominated in various foreign currencies, including Indian rupees and Japanese yen, as well as U.S. dollars. At August 31, 2008, these credit facilities incur interest at both fixed and variable rates ranging from 3.3% to 6.4% and range in outstanding amounts from $2.0 million to $25.6 million. (e) During the second quarter of fiscal year 2007, we entered into a three year loan agreement to borrow, $20.3 million from a software vendor in connection with various software licenses that we purchased from them. The software licenses were capitalized and are being amortized over a three year period. The loan agreement is non interest bearing and payments are due quarterly through October 2009. At August 31, 2008, $8.5 million is outstanding under this loan agreement. 59 Table of Contents During the third quarter of fiscal year 2005, we negotiated a five year, 400.0 million Indian rupee construction loan for an Indian subsidiary with an Indian branch of a global bank. Under the terms of the loan, we pay interest on outstanding borrowings based on a fixed rate of 7.45%. The construction loan expires on April 15, 2010 and all outstanding borrowings are then due and payable. The 400.0 million Indian rupee principal outstanding is equivalent to approximately $9.1 million based on currency exchange rates at August 31, 2008. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2005, we negotiated a five year, 25.0 million Euro construction loan for a Hungarian subsidiary with a Hungarian branch of a global bank. Under the terms of the loan facility, we pay interest on outstanding borrowings based on the Euro Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread of 0.925%. Quarterly principal repayments began in September 2006 to repay the amount of proceeds drawn under the construction loan. The construction loan expires on April 13, 2010. At August 31, 2008, borrowings of 10.1 million Euros (approximately $14.8 million based on currency exchange rates at August 31, 2008) were outstanding under the construction loan. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, we entered into the five year Credit Facility. This agreement provides for a revolving credit portion in the initial amount of $800.0 million, subject to potential increases up to $1.0 billion, and provides for a term portion in the amount of $400.0 million. Some or all of the lenders under the Credit Facility and their affiliates have various other relationships with us and our subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services, including cash management, loans, letter of credit and bank guarantee facilities, investment banking and trust services. We, along with some of our subsidiaries, have entered into foreign exchange contracts and other derivative arrangements with certain of the lenders and their affiliates. In addition, many, if not most, of the agents and lenders under the Credit Facility held positions as agent and or lender under our old revolving credit facility and the Bridge Facility. The revolving credit portion of the Credit Facility terminates on July 19, 2012, and the term loan portion of the Credit Facility requires payments of principal in annual installments of $20.0 million each, with a final payment of the remaining principal due on July 19, 2012. Interest and fees on Credit Facility advances are based on our unsecured long term indebtedness rating as determined by S&P and Moodys. Interest is charged at a rate equal to either 0% to 0.75% above the base rate or 0.375% to 1.75% above the Eurocurrency rate, where the base rate represents the greater of Citibank, N.A.s prime rate or 0.50% above the federal funds rate, and the Eurocurrency rate represents the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate, each as more fully defined in this credit agreement. Fees include a facility fee based on the revolving credit commitments of the lenders, a letter of credit fee based on the amount of outstanding letters of credit, and a utilization fee to be added to the revolving credit interest rate and any letter of credit fee during any period when the aggregate amount of outstanding advances and letters of credit exceeds 50% of the total revolving credit commitments of the lenders. Based on our current senior unsecured long term indebtedness rating as determined by S&P and Moodys, the current rate of interest (including the applicable facility and utilization fee) on a full draw under the revolving credit would be 0.275% above the base rate or 0.875% above the Eurocurrency rate, and the current rate of interest on the term portion would be the base rate or 0.875% above the Eurocurrency rate. We, along with our subsidiaries, are subject to the following financial covenants: (1) a maximum ratio of (a) Debt (as defined in the credit agreement) to (b) Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement) and (2) a minimum ratio of (a) Consolidated EBITDA to (b) interest payable on, and amortization of debt discount in respect of, Debt and loss on sales of trade accounts receivables pursuant to our securitization program. In addition, we are subject to other covenants, such as: limitation upon liens; limitation upon mergers, etc; limitation upon accounting changes; limitation upon subsidiary debt; limitation upon sales, etc of assets; limitation upon changes in nature of business; payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries; compliance with laws, etc; payment of taxes, etc; maintenance of insurance; preservation of corporate existence, etc; visitation rights; keeping of books; maintenance of properties, etc; transactions with affiliates; and reporting requirements. During fiscal year 2008, we borrowed $3.1 billion against the revolving credit portion of the Credit Facility. These borrowings were repaid in full during the fiscal year. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 a draw in the amount of $400.0 million was made under the term portion of the Credit Facility. At August 31, 2008, $380.0 million remains outstanding under the term portion of the Credit Facility. 60 Table of Contents In addition to the loans described above, at August 31, 2008 we have additional loans outstanding to fund working capital needs. These additional loans total approximately $10.6 million and are denominated in various foreign currencies including Indian rupees and Euros. Approximately $1.5 million of this total is due and payable within 12 months and is classified as short term on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The remaining $9.1 million is classified as long term on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and will be due and payable in April 2011. (f) During the second quarter of fiscal year 2007, we entered into a $1.0 billion Bridge Facility. Of the Bridge Facility, $900.0 million was designated for use by us as a one time borrowing (which may be paid down in increments) to finance the tender offer for and merger with Green Point and to pay related costs and expenses. The remaining $100.0 million of the Bridge Facility, which is now terminated, was a revolving facility to be used for our general corporate purposes. Interest and fees on the Bridge Facility advances were based on our unsecured long term indebtedness rating as determined by S&P and Moodys. Prior to the amendment of the Bridge Facility as described below, interest was charged at either a rate equal to 0% to 0.75% above the base rate or a rate equal to 0.55% to 1.75% above the Eurocurrency rate, where the base rate represented the greater of Citibank, N.A.s prime rate or 0.50% plus the federal funds rate, and the Eurocurrency rate represented the applicable LIBOR, each as more fully defined in the Bridge Facility. Prior to the amendment of the Bridge Facility as described below, the applicable margin for the base rate and the Eurocurrency rate could be increased by 0.25% or 0.50% per annum, depending on the length of time that the Bridge Facility remained outstanding. Fees included unused commitment fees based on the amount of each lenders commitment minus the principal amount of any outstanding advances made by the lender. Prior to the amendment of the Bridge Facility as described below, based on our unsecured long term indebtedness rating as determined by S&P and Moodys, the rate of interest on a full Eurocurrency rate draw (including the step up) would have been 0.50% above the base rate or 1.25% above the Eurocurrency rate, as defined above. The Bridge Facility required compliance with several financial and other covenants, and we were never in default of any of these covenants. On December 20, 2007, we amended (the Amendment) our Bridge Facility. As a result of the Amendment, (1) the termination date of the Bridge Facility was extended from December 20, 2007 to June 17, 2008, (2) the Bridge Facility was converted to a $200.0 million revolving credit facility that was available only if the Company had fully drawn on the revolving credit portion of the Credit Facility and (3) as described below, certain other portions of the Bridge Facility were also amended (the Bridge Facility, as so amended, shall be referred to herein as the Amended Bridge Facility). The Amendment specified that the proceeds of the revolving credit advances under the Amended Bridge Facility were to be used for our general corporate purposes and for those of our subsidiaries. Pursuant to the Amendment, interest and fees on advances under the Amended Bridge Facility continued to be based on our unsecured long term indebtedness rating as determined by S&P and Moodys. The interest rate was increased, such that interest was charged at either a rate equal to 0.3% to 1.5% above the base rate or a rate equal to 1.3% to 2.5% above the Eurocurrency rate, where the base rate represented the greater of Citibank, N.A.s prime rate or 0.5% plus the federal funds rate, and the Eurocurrency rate represented the applicable LIBOR, each as more fully defined in the Amended Bridge Facility. The applicable interest rate, whether based on the base rate or the Eurocurrency rate, was to have been increased by 0.25% on and after March 20, 2008. Fees included extension fees payable on March 20, 2008 and unused commitment fees based on the amount of the lenders commitments minus the principal amounts of any outstanding advances made by the lenders. Based on the Companys unsecured long term indebtedness rating as determined by S&P and Moodys at the date of termination of the Amended Bridge Facility, the then current rate of interest (excluding the unused commitment fees and other fees) on a base rate draw would have been 0.5% above the base rate or on a Eurocurrency rate draw 1.5% above the Eurocurrency rate, as defined above. On February 13, 2008, the Amended Bridge Facility was terminated. (g) During the third quarter of fiscal year 2006, we entered into a sale leaseback transaction involving our facility in Ayr, Scotland. During the sale leaseback period, we continued to occupy the facility through a three year leasing arrangement with the third party purchaser, which required quarterly lease payments of 61 Table of Contents 62.5 thousand pounds sterling (approximately $123.6 thousand based on currency exchange rates at May 31, 2008). We received cash proceeds of approximately 2.8 million pounds sterling (approximately $4.8 million based on currency exchange rates on the date of the transaction) and retained a right to receive additional consideration upon resale of the facility at a later date. Due primarily to our continuing involvement in the property, we were precluded from recording the transaction as a sale under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, as required by relevant accounting standards, the cash proceeds were recorded as a financing obligation. A portion of the quarterly lease payments was recorded as interest expense, based on an effective yield of 5.875%, and the remainder was recorded as a reduction of the financing obligation. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2008, we cancelled the lease contract with the third party purchaser which resulted in the reversal of the financing obligation, offset by the reversal of related plant, property and equipment. At August 31, 2008, the balance of the financing obligation has been fully reversed. (h) Through the acquisition of Green Point we assumed certain liabilities, including short and long term debt obligations totaling approximately $102.2 million at the date of acquisition. At August 31, 2008 approximately $1.0 million of debt is outstanding under these short term facilities with an interest rate of 2.9%. The long term debt obligations include mortgage and credit facilities with various banks in Taiwan and China. At August 31, 2008 approximately $19.1 million of fixed assets, including buildings and land, were pledged as collateral on the mortgage facility outstanding. The long term facilities are denominated in U.S. dollars and New Taiwan dollars, and incur interest at both fixed rates and rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base interest rates. At August 31, 2008, approximately $23.6 million of debt is outstanding under the long term facilities, with current interest rates ranging from 2.6% to 4.0%. Approximately $5.0 million of this total is due and payable within 12 months and is classified as short term on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The remaining $18.6 million will mature at various dates through July 2012 and is classified as long term on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. (i) During the third quarter of fiscal year 2008, we entered into an asset backed securitization program with a bank conduit. In connection with the securitization program certain of our foreign subsidiaries sell, on an ongoing basis, an undivided interest in designated pools of trade accounts receivable to a special purpose entity, which in turn borrows up to $200.0 million from the bank conduit to purchase those receivables and in which it grants security interests as collateral for the borrowings. The securitization program is accounted for as a borrowing under SFAS 140. The loan balance is calculated based on the terms of the securitization program agreements. The securitization program requires compliance with several covenants including a limitation on certain corporate actions such as mergers, consolidations and sale of substantially all assets. We pay interest at designated commercial paper rates plus a spread. The securitization program expires on April 6, 2009. At August 31, 2008, we had $170.9 million of debt outstanding under the program. In addition, we incurred interest expense at a variable rate of approximately 3.9% plus a fixed spread during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2008 in our Consolidated Statement of Earnings. At August 31, 2008, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash, available borrowings under our credit facilities and our accounts receivable securitization programs. Our working capital requirements and capital expenditures could continue to increase in order to support future expansions of our operations through construction of greenfield operations or acquisitions. It is possible that future expansions may be significant and may require the payment of cash. Future liquidity needs will also depend on fluctuations in levels of inventory and shipments, changes in customer order volumes and timing of expenditures for new equipment. We currently anticipate that during the next twelve months, our capital expenditures will be in the range of $250.0 million to $300.0 million, principally for machinery and equipment; expansion of existing manufacturing sites and the completion of new manufacturing sites in Eastern Europe, Asia and the U.S.; the expansion of our corporate headquarters and for information technology infrastructure upgrades. We believe that our level of resources, which include cash on hand, available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, additional 62 Table of Contents proceeds available under our accounts receivable securitization program and funds provided by operations, will be adequate to fund these capital expenditures, the payment of any declared quarterly dividends, payments for current and future restructuring activities, and our working capital requirements for the next twelve months. Should we desire to consummate significant additional acquisition opportunities or undertake significant additional expansion activities, our capital needs would increase and could possibly result in our need to increase available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities or access public or private debt and equity markets. There can be no assurance, however, that we would be successful in raising additional debt or equity on terms that we would consider acceptable. Our contractual obligations for short and long term debt arrangements, future interest on notes payable and long term debt, future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating lease arrangements and estimated future benefit plan payments as of August 31, 2008 are summarized below. We do not participate in, or secure financing for any unconsolidated limited purpose entities. We generally do not enter into non cancelable purchase orders for materials until we receive a corresponding purchase commitment from our customer. Non cancelable purchase orders do not typically extend beyond the normal lead time of several weeks at most. Purchase orders beyond this time frame are typically cancelable.

We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of long term payments, or the amount by which our liability will increase or decrease over time; therefore, the long term portion of our FIN 48 liability of $81.0 million has not been included in the contractual obligations table. 63 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Currency Exchange Risks We transact business in various foreign countries and are, therefore, subject to risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We enter into forward contracts to economically hedge transactional exposure associated with commitments arising from trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable and fixed purchase obligations denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective operating entity. All derivative instruments are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their respective fair market values in accordance with SFAS 133. We have elected not to prepare and maintain the documentation required for the transaction to qualify as an accounting hedge and, therefore, changes in fair value are recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The aggregate notional amount of outstanding contracts at August 31, 2008 was $1.7 billion. The fair value of these contracts amounted to a $31.1 million asset recorded in prepaid and other current assets and a $6.4 million liability recorded in accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The forward contracts will generally expire in less than four months, with five months being the maximum term of the contracts outstanding at August 31, 2008. Upon expiration of the contracts the change in fair value will be reflected in cost of revenue on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The forward contracts are denominated in Brazilian real, British pounds, Chinese yuan renminbi, Euro dollars, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, Malaysian ringgits, Mexican pesos, Polish zloty, Singapore dollars, Taiwanese dollars and U.S. dollars. Interest Rate Risk A portion of our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our domestic investment portfolio. We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. We place cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions. We protect our invested principal funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk. We mitigate default risk by generally investing in investment grade securities and by frequently positioning the portfolio to try to respond appropriately to a reduction in credit rating of any investment issuer, guarantor or depository to levels below the credit ratings dictated by our investment policy. The portfolio typically includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. At August 31, 2008, we had no outstanding investments. We pay interest on several of our outstanding borrowings at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base interest rates. There were $622.3 million in borrowings outstanding under these facilities at August 31, 2008. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note 8 Notes Payable, Long Term Debt and Long Term Lease Obligations to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our outstanding debt obligations.
