Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We are one of the leading providers of worldwide electronic manufacturing services and solutions. We provide comprehensive electronics design, production and product management services to companies in the aerospace, automotive, computing, consumer, defense, industrial, instrumentation, medical, networking, peripherals, solar, storage and telecommunications industries. The industry in which we operate is composed of companies that provide a range of manufacturing and design services to companies that utilize electronics components. The industry experienced rapid change and growth through the 1990s as an increasing number of companies chose to outsource an increasing portion, and, in some cases, all of their manufacturing requirements. In mid 2001, the industrys revenue declined as a result of significant cut backs in customer production requirements, which was consistent with the overall downturn in the technology sector at the time. In response to this downturn in the technology sector, we implemented restructuring programs to reduce our cost structure and further align our manufacturing capacity with the geographic production demands of our customers. Industry revenues generally began to stabilize in 2003 and companies began to turn more to outsourcing versus internal manufacturing. In addition, the number of industries serviced, as well as the market penetration in certain industries, by electronic manufacturing service providers has increased over the past several years. In mid 2008, the industrys revenue declined when a deteriorating macro economic environment resulted in illiquidity in the overall credit markets and a significant economic downturn in the North American, European and Asian markets. In response to this downturn, we implemented additional restructuring programs to reduce our cost structure and further align our manufacturing capacity with the geographic production demands of our customers. Uncertainty remains regarding the extent and timing of the current economic recovery. We will continue to monitor the current economic environment and its potential impact on both the customers that we serve as well as our end markets and closely manage our costs and capital resources so that we can respond appropriately as circumstances continue to change. On September 1, 2010, we reorganized our business into the following three segments: Diversified Manufacturing Services (DMS), Enterprise & Infrastructure (E&I) and High Velocity Systems (HVS). Our DMS segment is composed of dedicated resources to manage higher complexity global products in regulated industries and bring materials and process technologies including design and aftermarket services to our global customers. Our E&I and HVS segments offer integrated global supply chain solutions designed to provide cost effective solutions for our customers. Our E&I segment is focused on our customers primarily in the computing, storage, networking and telecommunication sectors. Our HVS segment is focused on the particular needs of the consumer products industry, including mobility, display, set top boxes and peripheral products such as printers and point of sale terminals. We derive revenue principally from manufacturing services related to electronic equipment built to customer specifications. We also derive revenue to a lesser extent from aftermarket services, design services and excess inventory sales. Revenue from manufacturing services and excess inventory sales is generally recognized, net of estimated product return costs, when goods are shipped; title and risk of ownership have passed; the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and recoverability is reasonably assured. Aftermarket service related revenue is recognized upon completion of the services. Design service related revenue is generally recognized upon completion and acceptance by the respective customer. We assume no significant obligations after product shipment. Our cost of revenue includes the cost of electronic components and other materials that comprise the products we manufacture; the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead; and adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory. As a provider of turnkey manufacturing services, we are responsible for procuring components and other materials. This requires us to commit significant 31 Table of Contents working capital to our operations and to manage the purchasing, receiving, inspection and stocking of materials. Although we bear the risk of fluctuations in the cost of materials and excess scrap, we periodically negotiate cost of materials adjustments with our customers. Net revenue from each product that we manufacture consists of an element based on the costs of materials in that product and an element based on the labor and manufacturing overhead costs allocated to that product. We refer to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on materials costs as material based revenue, and to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on labor and manufacturing overhead costs as manufacturing based revenue. Our gross margin for any product depends on the mix between the cost of materials in the product and the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead allocated to the product. We typically realize higher gross margins on manufacturing based revenue than we do on materials based revenue. As we gain experience in manufacturing a product, we usually achieve increased efficiencies, which result in lower labor and manufacturing overhead costs for that product. Our operating results are impacted by the level of capacity utilization of manufacturing facilities; indirect labor costs; and selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high production volume and high capacity utilization. During periods of low production volume, we generally have idle capacity and reduced operating income margins. We have consistently utilized advanced circuit design, production design and manufacturing technologies to meet the needs of our customers. To support this effort, our engineering staff focuses on developing and refining design and manufacturing technologies to meet specific needs of specific customers. Most of the expenses associated with these customer specific efforts are reflected in our cost of revenue. In addition, our engineers engage in R&D of new technologies that apply generally to our operations. The expenses of these R&D activities are reflected in the research and development line item within our Consolidated Statement of Operations. An important element of our strategy is the expansion of our global production facilities. The majority of our revenue and materials costs worldwide are denominated in U.S. dollars, while our labor and utility costs in operations outside the U.S. are denominated in local currencies. We economically hedge these local currency costs, based on our evaluation of the potential exposure as compared to the cost of the hedge, through the purchase of foreign exchange contracts. Changes in the fair market value of such hedging instruments are reflected within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. See Risk Factors We are subject to risks of currency fluctuations and related hedging operations. We currently depend, and expect to continue to depend, upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue and upon their growth, viability and financial stability. A significant reduction in sales to any of our large customers or a customer exerting significant pricing and margin pressures on us would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In the past, some of our customers have terminated their manufacturing arrangements with us or have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of design, production or product management services ordered from us, including moving a portion of their manufacturing from us in order to more fully utilize their excess internal manufacturing capacity. There can be no assurance that present or future customers will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us or significantly reduce or delay the volume of design, production or product management services ordered from us, or move a portion of their manufacturing from us in order to more fully utilize their excess internal manufacturing capacity. Any such termination of a manufacturing relationship or change, reduction or delay in orders could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. See Risk Factors Because we depend on a limited number of customers, a reduction in sales to any one of our customers could cause a significant decline in our revenue, Risk Factors Most of our customers do not commit to long term production schedules, which makes it difficult for us to schedule production and capital expenditures, and to maximize the efficiency of our manufacturing capacity, Risk Factors Our customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities, delay production or change their sourcing strategy and Note 11 Concentration of Risk and Segment Data to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Summary of Results Net revenues for fiscal year 2011 increased approximately 23.2% to $16.5 billion compared to $13.4 billion for fiscal year 2010 largely due to increased revenue from certain of our existing customers, including new program wins with these customers. The following table sets forth, for the fiscal year ended August 31, certain key operating results and other financial information (in thousands, except per share data). Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2011 2010 2009 Net revenue $ 16,518,827 $ 13,409,411 $ 11,684,538 Gross profit $ 1,254,570 $ 1,004,144 $ 718,815 Operating income (loss) $ 578,734 $ 327,566 $ (910,201 ) Net income (loss) attributable to Jabil Circuit, Inc $ 381,063 $ 168,840 $ (1,165,212 ) Income (loss) per share basic $ 1.78 $ 0.79 $ (5.63 ) Income (loss) per share diluted $ 1.73 $ 0.78 $ (5.63 ) 32 Table of Contents Key Performance Indicators Management regularly reviews financial and non financial performance indicators to assess the Companys operating results. The following table sets forth, for the quarterly periods indicated, certain of managements key financial performance indicators. Three Months Ended August 31,2011 May 31,2011 February 28,2011 November 30,2010 Sales cycle 8 days 11 days 11 days 16 days Inventory turns (annualized) 7 turns 7 turns 7 turns 7 turns Days in trade accounts receivable 23 days 22 days 24 days 26 days Days in inventory 51 days 52 days 53 days 52 days Days in accounts payable 66 days 63 days 66 days 62 days Three Months Ended August 31,2010 May 31,2010 February 28,2010 November 30,2009 Sales cycle 17 days 16 days 17 days 16 days Inventory turns (annualized) 7 turns 7 turns 7 turns 8 turns Days in trade accounts receivable 33 days 33 days 35 days 41 days Days in inventory 53 days 50 days 51 days 45 days Days in accounts payable 69 days 67 days 69 days 70 days The sales cycle is calculated as the sum of days in trade accounts receivable and days in inventory, less the days in accounts payable; accordingly, the variance in the sales cycle quarter over quarter is a direct result of changes in these indicators. During the three months ended August 31, 2011, days in trade accounts receivable increased one day to 23 days as compared to the prior sequential quarter as a result of the timing of sales and cash collection efforts during the quarter. During the three months ended May 31, 2011, days in trade accounts receivable decreased two days to 22 days as compared to the prior sequential quarter primarily as a result of the amendment to our foreign asset backed securitization program, which resulted in the receivables being sold to a third party financial institution, and no longer being recognized in trade accounts receivable. During the three months ended February 28, 2011, days in trade accounts receivable decreased two days to 24 days as compared to the prior sequential quarter as a result of increased use of our trade accounts receivable securitization and sale programs, the timing of sales, focused efforts on cash collections during the quarter and related seasonality factors. During the three months ended November 30, 2010, days in trade accounts receivable decreased seven days to 26 days as compared to the prior sequential quarter as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance related to the transfer of financial assets, coupled with an amendment to the asset backed securitization program during the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, which resulted in a deferred purchase price receivable being recorded to prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at November 30, 2010 as compared to a retained interest on receivables sold which was recorded to trade accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at August 31, 2010. Refer to Note 2 Trade Accounts Receivable Securitization and Sale Programs to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. During the three months ended August 31, 2011, May 31, 2011 and November 30, 2010, days in inventory decreased one day to 51 days, 52 days and 52 days, respectively, as compared to the prior sequential quarter largely due to increased sales activity during each quarter. During the three months ended February 28, 2011, days in inventory increased one day to 53 days as compared to the prior sequential quarter largely due to the acquisition of operations in France and Italy. Inventory turns, on an annualized basis, remained constant at seven turns during each quarter of fiscal year 2011. During the three months ended August 31, 2011, May 31, 2011, February 28, 2011 and November 30, 2010, days in accounts payable increased three days to 66 days, decreased three days to 63 days, increased four days to 66 days and decreased seven days to 62 days, respectively, from the prior sequential quarter primarily due to the timing of purchases and cash payments for purchases during the respective quarters. In addition, during the three months ended February 28, 2011 the increase in days in accounts payable was also due to the acquisition of operations in France and Italy. The sales cycle was eight days during the three months ended August 31, 2011, 11 days during the three months ended May 31, 2011, 11 days during the three months ended February 28, 2011 and 16 days during the three months ended November 30, 2010. The changes in the sales cycle are due to the changes in accounts receivable, accounts payable and inventory that are discussed above. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon 33 Table of Contents historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. Management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances. We have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. For further discussion of our significant accounting policies, refer to Note 1 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition We derive revenue principally from manufacturing services related to electronic equipment built to customer specifications. We also derive revenue to a lesser extent from aftermarket services, design services and excess inventory sales. Revenue from manufacturing services and excess inventory sales is generally recognized, net of estimated product return costs, when goods are shipped; title and risk of ownership have passed; the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and recoverability is reasonably assured. Aftermarket service related revenue is recognized upon completion of the services. Design service related revenue is generally recognized upon completion and acceptance by the respective customer. We assume no significant obligations after product shipment. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts related to receivables not expected to be collected from our customers. This allowance is based on managements assessment of specific customer balances, considering the age of receivables and financial stability of the customer. If there is an adverse change in the financial condition and circumstances of our customers, or if actual defaults are higher than provided for, an addition to the allowance may be necessary. Inventory Valuation We purchase inventory based on forecasted demand and record inventory at the lower of cost or market. Management regularly assesses inventory valuation based on current and forecasted usage, customer inventory related contractual obligations and other lower of cost or market considerations. If actual market conditions or our customers product demands are less favorable than those projected, additional valuation adjustments may be necessary. Long Lived Assets We review property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of property, plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the undiscounted projected cash flows that the asset(s) or asset group(s) are expected to generate. If the carrying amount of an asset or an asset group is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the long lived asset or asset group over its respective fair value, which is generally determined as either the present value of estimated future cash flows or the appraised value. The impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management, including revenue and cash flow projections. Circumstances that may lead to impairment of property, plant and equipment include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand and the restructuring of our operations resulting from a change in our business strategy or adverse economic conditions. For further discussion of our current restructuring program, refer to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Restructuring and Impairment Charges. We have recorded intangible assets, including goodwill, in connection with business acquisitions. Estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are determined by management based on an assessment of the period over which the asset is expected to contribute to future cash flows. The fair value of acquired amortizable intangible assets impacts the amounts recorded as goodwill. We perform a goodwill impairment analysis using the two step method on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting units carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. We determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an average weighting of both projected discounted future results and the use of comparative market multiples. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and a second test is performed to measure the amount of loss, if any. We completed our annual impairment test for goodwill during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 and determined that the fair values of our reporting units are substantially in excess of the carrying values and that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test. Restructuring and Impairment Charges We have recognized restructuring and impairment charges related to reductions in workforce, re sizing and closure of certain facilities and the transition of production from certain facilities into other new and existing facilities. These charges were recorded 34 Table of Contents pursuant to formal plans developed and approved by management and our Board of Directors. The recognition of restructuring and impairment charges requires that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature, timing and amount of costs associated with these plans. The estimates of future liabilities may change, requiring additional restructuring and impairment charges or the reduction of liabilities already recorded. At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with the restructuring programs. For further discussion of our restructuring programs, refer to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Restructuring and Impairment Charges. Retirement Benefits We have pension and postretirement benefit costs and liabilities in certain foreign locations that are developed from actuarial valuations. Actuarial valuations require management to make certain judgments and estimates of discount rates, compensation rate increases and return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions on a regular basis taking into consideration current market conditions and historical market data. The discount rate is used to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date. This rate represents the market rate for high quality fixed income investments. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. When considering the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets, we take into account current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on plan assets. Other assumptions include demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover. For further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefits, refer to Note 8 Postretirement and Other Employee Benefits to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes We estimate our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, a process that includes estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities. We must also make judgments regarding the ability to realize the deferred tax assets. The carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets that we do not believe meet the more likely than not criteria. We assess whether an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return meets the threshold for recognition and measurement in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our judgments regarding future taxable income as well as tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return may change due to changes in market conditions, changes in tax laws or other factors. If our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future, the valuation allowances and or tax reserves established may be increased or decreased, resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) completed its field examination of our tax returns for the fiscal years 2003 through 2005 and issued a Revenue Agents Report (RAR) on April 30, 2010 proposing adjustments primarily related to the IRS contentions that (1) certain corporate expenses relate to services provided to foreign affiliates and therefore must be charged to those affiliates, and (2) valuable intangible property was transferred to certain foreign affiliates without charge. If the IRS ultimately prevails in its positions, our income tax payment due for the fiscal years 2003 through 2005 would be approximately an additional $69.3 million before utilization of any tax attributes arising in periods subsequent to fiscal year 2005. In addition, the IRS will likely make similar claims in future audits with respect to these types of transactions (at this time, determination of the additional income tax due for these later years is not practicable). Also, the IRS has proposed interest and penalties on us with respect to fiscal years 2003 through 2005, and we anticipate the IRS may seek to impose interest and penalties in subsequent years with respect to the same types of issues. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and are vigorously contesting this matter through applicable IRS and judicial procedures, as appropriate. As the final resolution of the proposed adjustments remains uncertain, we continue to provide for the uncertain tax position based on the more likely than not standards. Accordingly, we did not record any significant additional tax liabilities related to this RAR on the Consolidated Balance Sheets during fiscal year 2011. While the resolution of the issues may result in tax liabilities, interest and penalties, which are significantly higher than the amounts provided for this matter, management currently believes that the resolution will not have a material effect on our financial position or liquidity. Despite this belief, an unfavorable resolution, particularly if the IRS successfully asserts similar claims for later years, could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition (particularly during the quarter in which any adjustment is recorded or any tax is due or paid). For further discussion related to our income taxes, refer to Note 4 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Risk Factors We are subject to the risk of increased taxes. Stock Based Compensation We recognize stock based compensation expense within our Consolidated Statements of Operations related to stock appreciation rights using a lattice model to determine the fair value. Option pricing models require the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the option or stock appreciation right, risk free rate, expected dividend yield and the price 35 Table of Contents volatility of the underlying stock. Judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock awards that are expected to vest as a result of satisfaction of time based vesting schedules or the achievement of certain performance or market conditions. If actual results or future changes in estimates differ significantly from our current estimates, stock based compensation expense could increase or decrease. For further discussion of our stock based compensation, refer to Note 10 Stockholders Equity to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 15 New Accounting Guidance to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting guidance. Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of net revenue: Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2011 2010 2009 Net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenue 92.4 92.5 93.8 Gross profit 7.6 7.5 6.2 Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative 3.6 4.4 4.3 Research and development 0.2 0.2 0.2 Amortization of intangibles 0.1 0.2 0.3 Restructuring and impairment charges 0.0 0.1 0.4 Goodwill impairment charges 8.8 Settlement of receivables and related charges 0.1 Loss on disposal of subsidiaries 0.1 0.2 Operating income (loss) 3.5 2.4 (7.8 ) Other expense 0.0 0.0 0.2 Interest income (0.0 ) (0.0 ) (0.1 ) Interest expense 0.6 0.6 0.7 Income (loss) before income tax 2.9 1.8 (8.6 ) Income tax expense 0.6 0.5 1.4 Net income (loss) 2.3 1.3 (10.0 ) Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of income tax expense 0.0 0.0 (0.0 ) Net income (loss) attributable to Jabil Circuit, Inc 2.3 % 1.3 % (10.0 %) Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2011 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2010 Net Revenue. Our net revenue increased 23.2% to $16.5 billion for fiscal year 2011, up from $13.4 billion in fiscal year 2010. Specific increases include a 76% increase in the sale of specialized services products; a 31% increase in the sale of instrumentation and healthcare products; a 19% increase in the sale of industrial and CleanTech products; an 18% increase in the sale of E&I products; and an 11% increase in the sale of HVS products. These increases for fiscal year 2011 are primarily due to increased revenue from certain of our existing customers, including new program wins with these customers. Generally, we assess revenue on a global customer basis regardless of whether the growth is associated with organic growth or as a result of an acquisition. Accordingly, we do not differentiate or report separately revenue increases generated by acquisitions as opposed to existing business. In addition, the added cost structures associated with our acquisitions have historically been relatively insignificant when compared to our overall cost structure. The distribution of revenue across our sectors has fluctuated, and will continue to fluctuate, as a result of numerous factors, including but not limited to the following: fluctuations in customer demand as a result of recent recessionary conditions; efforts to de emphasize the economic performance of certain sectors, most specifically, our former automotive and display sectors; seasonality in our business; and business growth from new and existing customers. As discussed in the Overview section, on September 1, 2010, we reorganized our business into the following three segments: DMS, E&I and HVS. In conjunction with this reorganization, there have been certain reclassifications made within the reported sectors. 36 Table of Contents The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, revenue by segment expressed as a percentage of net revenue: Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2011 2010 2009 DMS Specialized Services 17 % 12 % 12 % Industrial & CleanTech 12 % 13 % 11 % Instrumentation & Healthcare 7 % 7 % 6 % Total DMS 36 % 32 % 29 % Total E&I 32 % 32 % 34 % Total HVS 32 % 36 % 37 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % Foreign source revenue represented 86.0% of our net revenue for fiscal year 2011 and 84.7% of net revenue for fiscal year 2010. We currently expect our foreign source revenue to remain relatively consistent as compared to current levels over the course of the next 12 months. Gross Profit. Gross profit increased to $1.3 billion (7.6% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2011 from $1.0 billion (7.5% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2010. The increase in gross profit on an absolute basis and as a percentage of net revenue from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to increased revenue from certain of our existing customers, including new program wins with these customers, which allow us to better utilize capacity and absorb fixed costs, an increased focus on controlling costs and improving productivity and additional growth in the DMS segment, which typically has higher margins than the E&I and HVS segments. Selling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses remained relatively constant at $590.6 million (3.6% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2011 compared to $589.7 million (4.4% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2010. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue between fiscal years 2011 and 2010 is due to an increased focus on controlling costs, as well as being able to better absorb fixed costs as revenue levels increase. Research and Development. Research and development (R&D) expenses for fiscal year 2011 decreased to $25.0 million (0.2% of net revenue) from $28.1 million (0.2% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2010. The decrease is primarily due to a greater portion of engineering resources working on customer funded design projects and R&D activity being moved to our design centers in lower cost geographies. Amortization of Intangibles. We recorded $22.1 million of amortization of intangibles in fiscal year 2011 as compared to $25.9 million in fiscal year 2010. The decrease is primarily attributable to certain intangible assets that became fully amortized since August 31, 2010. For additional information regarding purchased intangibles, see Acquisitions and Expansion below, Note 1(f) Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Note 6 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Restructuring and Impairment Charges. a. 2009 Restructuring Plan Upon the approval by our Board of Directors, we initiated a restructuring plan during the second quarter of fiscal year 2009 (the 2009 Restructuring Plan). We have substantially completed restructuring activities under this plan and do not expect to incur any additional costs under the 2009 Restructuring Plan. During fiscal year 2011, we reversed $0.1 million of previously recognized restructuring and impairment costs, compared to charges of $7.7 million of restructuring and impairment costs recorded during fiscal year 2010. At August 31, 2011, accrued liabilities of approximately $0.1 million related to the 2009 Restructuring Plan are expected to be paid over the next fiscal quarter. As of August 31, 2011, the 2009 Restructuring Plan is expected to yield annualized cost savings of approximately $55.6 million, which we are now fully realizing. The majority of these annual cost savings are expected to be reflected as a reduction in cost of 37 Table of Contents revenue, with a small portion being reflected as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expense. These expected annualized cost savings reflect a reduction in employee expense of approximately $42.4 million, a reduction in depreciation expense of approximately $5.9 million, a reduction in lease commitment costs of approximately $0.1 million, a reduction of other manufacturing costs of approximately $3.8 million and a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately $3.4 million. As part of the 2009 Restructuring Plan, we have determined that it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets would not be realized as a result of the contemplated restructuring activities. Therefore, we recorded a valuation allowance of $14.8 million on net deferred tax assets related to the 2009 Restructuring Plan. The valuation allowance is excluded from the restructuring and impairment charges incurred through August 31, 2011 as it was recorded to income tax expense within our Consolidated Statements of Operations. b. 2006 Restructuring Plan Upon the approval by our Board of Directors, we initiated a restructuring plan during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 (the 2006 Restructuring Plan). We have substantially completed restructuring activities under this plan and do not expect to incur any additional costs under the 2006 Restructuring Plan. During fiscal year 2011, we recorded approximately $0.7 million of restructuring and impairment costs, compared to charges of $0.5 million of restructuring and impairment charges recorded during fiscal year 2010. The restructuring and impairment costs for fiscal year 2011 are primarily related to lease commitment costs. At August 31, 2011, liabilities of approximately $0.9 million related to the 2006 Restructuring Plan are expected to be paid out over the next twelve months. The remaining liability of $1.6 million relates primarily to the charge for employee severance and termination benefits payments. Settlement of Receivables and Related Charges. We recorded a loss on settlement of receivables and related charges of $13.6 million during fiscal year 2011. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, we completed our acquisition of F I Holding Company, which directly or indirectly wholly owns Competence France Holdings SAS, a French entity which wholly owns Competence France SAS, and Competence EMEA S.r.l., an Italian entity which wholly owns Competence Italia S.r.l. (Competence France Holdings SAS, Competence France SAS, Competence EMEA S.r.l. and Competence Italia S.r.l. are collectively referred to as the Competence Sites herein). The Competence Sites were our former operations and were previously disposed of on July 16, 2010. Refer to Note 13 Loss on Disposal of Subsidiaries to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, immediately prior to the acquisition of the Competence Sites, we recognized a charge of $12.7 million in order to record $35.0 million in receivables and other relationships with the Competence Sites at their respective fair values. In addition, we recognized acquisition costs and other related charges of $0.9 million during the second quarter of fiscal year 2011. Refer to Note 14 Business Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. Loss on Disposal of Subsidiaries. We recorded a loss on disposal of subsidiaries of $23.9 million during fiscal year 2011 and $24.6 million during fiscal year 2010. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2010, we sold the operations of Jabil Circuit Automotive, SAS, an automotive electronic manufacturing subsidiary located in Western Europe to an unrelated third party. In connection with this sale, we recorded a loss on disposition of approximately $15.7 million, which includes approximately $4.2 million in transaction costs incurred in connection with the sale during the three months ended November 30, 2009. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010, we sold F I Holding Company, which directly or indirectly wholly owns the Competence Sites, to an unrelated third party. In connection with this transaction, we provided an aggregate $25.0 million working capital loan to the disposed operations. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010, we recorded a charge of $8.9 million to loss on disposal of subsidiaries within the Consolidated Statement of Operations, including $1.7 million of transaction related costs and $6.5 million in order to record the working capital loan at its respective fair market value at August 31, 2010 based upon a discounted cash flow analysis. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, we recorded a charge of $23.9 million to loss on disposal of subsidiaries within the Consolidated Statement of Operations, including $18.5 million to fully write off the remaining balance of the working capital loan and $5.4 million to write off a purchase price related receivable that we were due from the third party purchaser as they were deemed no longer collectible. Refer to Note 13 Loss on Disposal of Subsidiaries to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Other Expense. Other expense remained relatively constant at $3.0 million for fiscal year 2011 compared to $4.1 million for fiscal year 2010, respectively. 38 Table of Contents Interest Income. Interest income remained relatively constant at $3.1 million for fiscal year 2011 compared to $3.0 million for fiscal year 2010. Interest Expense. We recorded $97.7 million of interest expense in fiscal year 2011 as compared to $79.2 million in fiscal year 2010. The increase was primarily due to interest associated with the issuance of our 5.625% Senior Notes during the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 and the refinancing of the credit facility dated as of July 19, 2007 (the Old Credit Facility) at market rates, which were higher than the Old Credit Facilitys, during the second quarter of fiscal year 2011. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of 20.4% for fiscal year 2011, as compared to an effective tax rate of 30.9% for fiscal year 2010. The effective tax rate differs from the previous period due to the amount of earnings, mix of tax rates, and increase in tax incentives in the various jurisdictions in which we do business and the sale of French and Italian subsidiaries in fiscal year 2010, partially offset by the acquisition of F I Holding Company which owns the Competence Sites in fiscal year 2011. Most of our international operations have historically been taxed at a lower rate than in the U.S., primarily due to tax incentives granted to our sites in Brazil, China, Hungary, Malaysia, Poland, Singapore and Vietnam. The material tax incentives expire at various dates through 2020. Such tax incentives are subject to conditions with which we expect to continue to comply. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Income Taxes, Risk Factors We are subject to the risk of increased taxes and Note 4 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements further discussion. Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2010 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2009 Net Revenue. Our net revenue increased 14.8% to $13.4 billion for fiscal year 2010, up from $11.7 billion in fiscal year 2009. Specific increases include a 34% increase in the sale of industrial and CleanTech products; a 31% increase in the sale of instrumentation and healthcare products; a 16% increase in the sale of specialized services products; an 11% increase in the sale of HVS products; and a 10% increase in the sale of E&I products. These increases for fiscal year 2010 were primarily due to increased revenue from existing customers and programs as our customers confidence in their markets strengthened and their end customers demand levels increased, as well as new customer wins and new program wins with existing customers. Foreign source revenue represented 84.7% of our net revenue for fiscal year 2010 and 83.8% of net revenue for fiscal year 2009. For further discussion of our net revenues, refer to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2011 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2010 Net Revenue. Gross Profit. Gross profit increased to $1.0 billion (7.5% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2010 from $718.8 million (6.2% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2009. The increase in gross profit on an absolute basis and as a percentage of net revenue from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to increased revenue from existing customers and programs as our customers confidence in their markets strengthened and their end customers demand levels increased as well as new customer wins and new program wins with existing customers which allowed us to better utilize capacity and absorb fixed costs. Further, we realized certain cost savings associated with initiatives that we commenced in fiscal year 2009 to reduce our cost structure in order to better align with lower demand levels and increased capacity utilization which allowed us to better leverage our cost structure. Selling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $589.7 million (4.4% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2010 from $495.9 million (4.3% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2009. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses on an absolute basis and as a percentage of net revenue from fiscal year 2009 was largely due to increases in stock based compensation expense of $60.6 million primarily due to a change in the estimated vesting of performance based restricted stock awards and incremental expense recognized related to the modification of certain existing equity awards to include retirement eligibility provisions, $19.6 million related to additional salary and bonus expense due to increased headcount and results of operations in fiscal year 2010 and $13.5 million related to professional fees associated with multiple internal strategic and cost saving initiatives. Research and Development. R&D expenses for fiscal year 2010 increased to $28.1 million (0.2% of net revenue) from $27.3 million (0.2% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2009. The increase was attributed primarily to our increased focus on vertical integration capabilities in our mobility market and increased capabilities and proficiencies in digital home office and printer markets. Amortization of Intangibles. We recorded $25.9 million of amortization of intangibles in fiscal year 2010 as compared to $31.0 million in fiscal year 2009. The decrease was primarily attributable to certain intangible assets that became fully amortized since August 31, 2009. For additional information regarding purchased intangibles, see Acquisitions and Expansion below, Note 1(f) Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Note 6 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 39 Table of Contents Restructuring and Impairment Charges. a. 2009 Restructuring Plan We charged $7.7 million and $53.7 million of restructuring and impairment costs during the 12 months ended August 31, 2010 and August 31, 2009, respectively, to our Consolidated Statement of Operations. The charges related to the 2009 Restructuring Plan recorded during fiscal year 2010 include approximately $3.7 million related to employee severance and termination benefit costs, $3.4 million related to lease commitments and $0.6 million related to fixed asset impairments. b. 2006 Restructuring Plan We recorded restructuring and impairment charges of $0.5 million during fiscal year 2010 and a reversal of restructuring and impairment costs of $1.8 million in fiscal year 2009. The restructuring and impairment costs for fiscal year 2010 primarily included additional lease commitment charges. For further discussion of the 2009 Restructuring Program and the 2006 Restructuring Program, refer to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2011 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2010 Restructuring and Impairment Charges. Goodwill Impairment Charges. We recorded non cash goodwill impairment charges of $1.0 billion for the full fiscal year ended August 31, 2009 (of which the entire $1.0 billion charge was incurred in the first two quarters) to reduce the carrying amount of our goodwill to its estimated fair value based upon the results of two interim impairment tests conducted during the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2009. We performed these impairment tests based upon a combination of factors, including a significant and sustained decline in our market capitalization below our carrying value, the deteriorating macro economic environment, which resulted in a significant decline in customer demand, and illiquidity in the overall credit markets. Loss on Disposal of Subsidiaries. Refer to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2011 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2010 Loss on Disposal of Subsidiaries for discussion of the $24.6 million charge recorded to loss on disposal of subsidiaries within the Consolidated Statement of Operations during fiscal year 2010. Other Expense. We recorded other expense totaling $4.1 million and $20.1 million for fiscal years 2010 and 2009, respectively. The decrease in other expense for fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to the recognition of a $10.5 million loss on the extinguishment of $294.9 million of our 5.875% Senior Notes and a $4.2 million loss on the impairment of a note receivable in fiscal year 2009 as well as a decrease in the loss on the sale of accounts receivable under our asset backed securitization program of $1.4 million in fiscal year 2010 which was primarily due to a decrease in borrowing costs. For further discussion of our accounts receivable securitization program, see Note 2 Trade Accounts Receivable Securitization and Sale Programs to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest Income. Interest income decreased to $3.0 million in fiscal year 2010 from $7.4 million in fiscal year 2009. The decrease was primarily due to lower overall interest rates during fiscal year 2010. Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased to $79.2 million in fiscal year 2010 from $82.2 million in fiscal year 2009. The decrease was primarily due to lower overall interest rates during fiscal year 2010. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of 30.9% for fiscal year 2010, as compared to an effective tax rate of (16.0)% for fiscal year 2009. The effective tax rate differs from the previous period due to the impairment of non deductible goodwill and the corresponding valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets that were no longer more likely than not to be realized in fiscal year 2009. The tax rate is predominantly a function of the mix of tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we do business. Most of our international operations have historically been taxed at a lower rate than in the U.S., primarily due to tax incentives granted to our sites in Brazil, China, Hungary, Malaysia, Poland, Singapore and Vietnam. The material tax incentives expire at various dates through 2020. Such tax incentives are subject to conditions with which we expect to continue to comply. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Income Taxes, Risk Factors We are subject to the risk of increased taxes and Note 4 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Non U.S. GAAP Core Financial Measures The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations include certain non U.S. GAAP financial measures as identified in the reconciliation below. The non U.S. GAAP financial measures disclosed herein do not have standard meaning and may vary from the non U.S. GAAP financial measures used by other companies or how we may calculate those measures in other instances from time to time. Non U.S. GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Also, our core financial measures should not be construed as an inference by us that our future results will be unaffected by those items which are excluded from our core financial measures. 40 Table of Contents Management believes that the non U.S. GAAP core financial measures set forth below are useful to facilitate evaluating the past and future performance of our ongoing manufacturing operations over multiple periods on a comparable basis by excluding the effects of the amortization of intangibles, stock based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and impairment charges, settlement of receivables and related charges, loss on disposal of subsidiaries and distressed customer charges. Among other uses, management uses non U.S. GAAP core financial measures as a factor in determining employee performance when determining incentive compensation. We are reporting core operating income and core earnings to provide investors with an additional method for assessing operating income and earnings, presenting what we believe are our core manufacturing operations. Most of the items that are excluded for purposes of calculating core operating income and core earnings also impacted certain balance sheet assets, resulting in all or a portion of an asset being written off without a corresponding recovery of cash we may have previously spent with respect to the asset. In the case of restructuring charges, we may be making associated cash payments in the future. In addition, although, for purposes of calculating core operating income and core earnings, we exclude stock based compensation expense (which we anticipate continuing to incur in the future) because it is a non cash expense, the associated stock issued may result in an increase in our outstanding shares of stock, which may result in the dilution of our stockholders ownership interest. We encourage you to evaluate these items and the limitations for purposes of analysis in excluding them. Included in the table below is a reconciliation of the non U.S. GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures as provided in our Consolidated Financial Statements (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2011 2010 2009 Operating income (loss) (U.S. GAAP) $ 578,734 $ 327,566 $ (910,201 ) Amortization of intangibles 22,051 25,934 31,039 Stock based compensation and related charges 76,230 104,609 44,026 Restructuring and impairment charges 628 8,217 51,894 Goodwill impairment charges 1,022,821 Settlement of receivables and related charges 13,607 Loss on disposal of subsidiaries 23,944 24,604 Distressed customer charges 7,256 Core operating income (Non U.S. GAAP) $ 715,194 $ 490,930 $ 246,835 Net income (loss) attributable to Jabil Circuit, Inc.

Core operating income in fiscal year 2011 increased 45.7% to $715.2 million compared to $490.9 million in fiscal year 2010. Core earnings in fiscal year 2011 increased 56.3% to $516.3 million compared to $330.4 million in fiscal year 2010. These increases were the result of the same factors described above in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2011 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2010 Gross Profit. Quarterly Results (Unaudited) The following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly financial information for the 2011 and 2010 fiscal years. In the opinion of management, this information has been presented on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere, and all necessary adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the unaudited quarterly results when read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto.

The Competence Sites were our former operations and were previously disposed of during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010. This acquisition, as well as acquisitions that were made in prior years, have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the operating results of each business from the date of acquisition. See Risk Factors We have on occasion not achieved, and may not in the future achieve, expected profitability from our acquisitions. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, we announced that we entered into an agreement to acquire Telmar Network Technology, Inc., a provider of complex reverse logistics, repair services, technical support, and spare parts management solutions for communication network service providers, enterprise and original equipment manufacturers worldwide. Completion of this transaction, which is subject to regulatory clearance and customary conditions, is expected to take place during the first half of fiscal year 2012. Liquidity and Capital Resources At August 31, 2011, we had cash and cash equivalent balances totaling $888.6 million, total notes payable and long term debt of $1.2 billion, $1.0 billion in available liquidity under our revolving credit facilities and up to $353.6 million in available liquidity under our trade accounts receivable securitization and uncommitted sale programs. As the sale programs are uncommitted, we can offer no assurance that if we attempt to draw on such programs in the future that we will receive funding from the associated banks which would require us to utilize other available sources of liquidity, including our revolving credit facilities. 44 Table of Contents The following table sets forth, for the fiscal year ended August 31 selected consolidated cash flow information (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2011 2010 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 828,009 $ 427,410 $ 557,309 Net cash used in investing activities (426,278 ) (440,257 ) (286,175 ) Net cash used in by financing activities (267,722 ) (100,280 ) (195,913 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 10,273 (18,816 ) 28,128 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 144,282 $ (131,943 ) $ 103,349 Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2011 was approximately $828.0 million. This resulted primarily from net income of $383.0 million, $319.2 million in non cash depreciation and amortization expense, a $305.8 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, $76.2 million in stock based compensation expense and a $48.2 million decrease in trade accounts receivable; which were partially offset by a $212.3 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a $158.5 million increase in inventories. The decrease in trade accounts receivable was primarily driven by the amendment to our foreign asset backed securitization program which resulted in the receivables being sold to a third party bank no longer being recognized in trade accounts receivable whereas previously the program was accounted for as a secured borrowing and an increase in the sales activity under the non foreign and foreign asset backed securitization programs. The increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily driven by the timing of purchases and cash payments. The increase in inventories was primarily due to the ramp up of inventory levels to support new business wins and higher revenue levels. The increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily driven by an increase in the deferred purchase price receivable under the foreign asset backed securitization program and the non foreign asset backed securitization program due to the timing of cash payments and the sale of receivables under the programs. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2011 was $426.3 million. This consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $459.0 million principally for machinery and equipment for new business, including new process technology within our DMS segment, maintenance levels of machinery and equipment and information technology infrastructure upgrades; which were partially offset by $23.5 million of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment. Net cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2011 was $267.7 million. This resulted from our receipt of approximately $7.6 billion of proceeds from borrowings under existing debt agreements, which primarily included an aggregate of $6.7 billion of borrowings under the Old Credit Facility and the Amended and Restated Credit Facility and our $400.0 million of 5.625% Senior Notes. This was offset by repayments in an aggregate amount of approximately $7.6 billion during fiscal year 2011, which primarily included an aggregate of $6.7 billion of repayments under the Old Credit Facility and the Amended and Restated Credit Facility and $340.0 million under the term portion of the Old Credit Facility. In addition, we paid $200.2 million to acquire treasury stock and $60.4 million in dividends to stockholders during fiscal year 2011. We may need to finance day to day working capital needs, as well as future growth and any corresponding working capital needs, with additional borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Facility and our other revolving credit facilities described below, as well as additional public and private offerings of our debt and equity. Currently, we have a shelf registration statement with the SEC. Promptly after filing this Annual Report on Form 10 K, as a result of our existing shelf registration statement expiring October 29, 2011, we anticipate terminating our existing shelf registration statement and filing a new shelf registration statement under the registration procedures set forth in the Securities Act. The new shelf registration statement will register the potential sale of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities in the future, from time to time over the three years following the registration, to augment our liquidity and capital resources. Any future sale of issuance of equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to current shareholders. Further, we may issue debt securities that have rights and privileges senior to those of holders of ordinary shares, and the terms of this debt could impose restrictions on operations, increase debt service obligations, limit our flexibility as a result of debt service requirements and restrictive covenants, potentially negatively affect our credit ratings, and limit our ability to access additional capital or execute our business strategy. We continue to asses our capital structure and evaluate the merits of redeploying available cash to reduce existing debt or repurchase ordinary shares. In connection with our non foreign asset backed securitization program, we regularly sell a designated pool of trade accounts receivable to a wholly owned subsidiary, which in turn sells 100% of the eligible receivables to conduits, administered by unaffiliated financial institutions. This wholly owned subsidiary is a separate bankruptcy remote entity and its assets would be available first to satisfy the creditor claims of the conduits. As the receivables sold are collected, the wholly owned subsidiary is able to sell additional receivables up to the maximum permitted amount under the program. Net cash proceeds of $300.0 million are available at any one time under the securitization program. Prior to September 1, 2010, the transactions in this program were accounted for as sales under applicable accounting guidance. Effective September 1, 2010, we adopted new accounting guidance that resulted in more stringent conditions for reporting the transfer of a financial asset as a sale. As a result of the adoption of this new guidance, the accounts receivable transferred under this program no longer qualified for sale treatment and as such were accounted for as secured borrowings. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, this program was amended which resulted in the transfers of the applicable accounts receivable again being accounted for as sales. Under the amended program any portion of the purchase price for the receivables which 45 Table of Contents is not paid in cash upon the sale taking place is recorded as a deferred purchase price receivable, which is paid by the conduits from available cash as payments on the receivables are collected. The securitization program requires compliance with several financial covenants including an interest coverage ratio and debt to EBITDA ratio, as defined in the securitization agreements. The program was amended on October 21, 2011 to, among other things, extend the program to October 21, 2014 and adjust pricing to reflect current market conditions. Net receivables sold under this program are excluded from trade accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are reflected as cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The wholly owned subsidiary is assessed (i) a fee on the unused portion of the program of 0.50% per annum based on the average daily unused aggregate receivables sold during the period, (ii) a usage fee on the utilized portion of the program equal to 0.95% per annum (inclusive of the unused fee) on the average daily outstanding aggregate receivables sold during the immediately preceding calendar month and (iii) a fee on the weighted average amount outstanding under the program during the period multiplied by the applicable rate in effect for the period (i.e. Commercial Paper rate). The securitization conduits and the investors in the conduits have no recourse to our assets for failure of debtors to pay when due. We continue to service the receivables sold and in exchange receive a servicing fee. Servicing fees recognized during fiscal year 2011 and 2010 were not material and are included in other expense within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We do not record a servicing asset or liability as we estimate the fee we receive in return for our obligation to service these receivables is at fair value. We sold $5.8 billion, $5.3 billion and $4.7 billion of eligible trade accounts receivable during fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In exchange, we received cash proceeds of $5.5 billion, $5.1 billion and $4.5 billion during fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and a net deferred purchase price receivable (at August 31, 2011) or a retained interest (at August 31, 2010 and 2009). At August 31, 2011, the deferred purchase price receivable totaled approximately $295.6 million, which was recorded initially at fair value as prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At August 31, 2010 and 2009, we retained an interest in the receivables of $225.1 million and $222.3 million, respectively. The deferred purchase price receivable was valued using unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs), primarily discounted cash flows, and due to its credit quality and short term maturity, the fair value approximated book value. We recognized pretax losses on the sales of receivables of approximately $2.7 million, $3.6 million and $5.3 million during fiscal year 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, which are recorded to other expense within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Prior to execution of the previously discussed amendment, we recognized interest expense of approximately $0.5 million during the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 associated with the secured borrowings. See Note 2 Trade Accounts Receivable Securitization and Sale Programs and Note 15 New Accounting Guidance to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with our non foreign asset backed securitization program, at August 31, 2011, we had sold $527.3 million of eligible trade accounts receivable, which represents the face amount of total outstanding receivables at that date. In exchange, we received cash proceeds of $230.3 million, and a net deferred purchase price receivable. At August 31, 2011, the deferred purchase price receivable totaled approximately $295.6 million. In connection with our foreign asset backed securitization program, prior to the amendment during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, certain of our foreign subsidiaries sold, on an ongoing basis, an undivided interest in designated pools of trade accounts receivable to a special purpose entity, which in turn borrowed up to $100.0 million from an unaffiliated financial institution and granted a security interest in the accounts receivable as collateral for the borrowings. The securitization program was accounted for as a borrowing. The loan balance was calculated based on the terms of the securitization program agreements. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, the securitization program was amended to provide for the sale of 100% of our designated trade accounts receivable of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to the special purpose entity which in turn sells 100% of the receivables to an unaffiliated financial institution. The special purpose entity is a separate bankruptcy remote entity and its assets would be available first to satisfy the creditor claims of the unaffiliated financial institution. Net cash proceeds of $200.0 million are available at any one time under the amended securitization program. Transfers of the receivables to the unaffiliated financial institution are accounted for as sales. Under the amended program, any portion of the purchase price for the receivables which is not paid in cash to the special purpose entity upon the sale taking place is recorded as a deferred purchase price receivable, which is paid to the special purpose entity as payments on the receivables are collected. The foreign asset backed securitization program requires compliance with several covenants including limitations on certain corporate actions such as mergers and consolidations. The securitization agreement, as amended during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, expires on May 10, 2012. As we have the power to direct the activities of the special purpose entity and the obligation to absorb the majority of the expected losses or the right to receive benefits from the transfer of trade accounts receivable into the special purpose entity, we are deemed the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, we consolidate the special purpose entity (which was also the case prior to the amendment during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011). Net receivables sold under this program are excluded from trade accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are reflected as cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The special purpose entity is assessed (i) a fee in an amount equal to 0.45% per annum multiplied by the maximum aggregate invested amount during the period and (ii) a fee on the average amount outstanding under the program during the period multiplied by the applicable rate in effect for the period (i.e. LIBOR for U.S. dollars, EURIBOR for euros and WIBOR for Polish zlotys) plus a 0.45% per annum margin. The unaffiliated financial institution has no recourse to our assets for failure of debtors to pay when due. We continue servicing the receivables in the program and in exchange receive a servicing fee. Servicing fees recognized during fiscal years 2011 and 2010 were not material and are included in interest expense up through the amendment that occurred in the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, and 46 Table of Contents are included in other expense within the Consolidated Statements of Operations subsequent to the amendment. We do not record a servicing asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as we estimate the fee we receive in return for its obligation to service these receivables is at fair value. Subsequent to the amendment that occurred in the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we sold (including amounts transferred into the program on the amendment date) $928.0 million of eligible trade accounts receivable during fiscal year 2011. In exchange, we received cash proceeds of $783.9 million during the same period, and a net deferred purchase price receivable. At August 31, 2011, the deferred purchase price receivable totaled approximately $143.5 million, which was recorded initially at fair value as prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The deferred purchase price receivable was valued using unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs), primarily discounted cash flows, and due to its credit quality and short term maturity the fair value approximated book value. The resulting losses on the sales of the receivables, subsequent to the amendment that occurred in the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, were $0.7 million during fiscal year 2011, and were recorded to other expense within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Prior to execution of the previously discussed amendment, we recognized interest expense of approximately $0.9 million during fiscal year 2011 associated with the secured borrowings. At August 31, 2010, we had $71.4 million of secured borrowings outstanding under the program. In addition, we incurred interest expense of $2.1 million and $3.9 million during fiscal years 2010 and 2009, respectively. In connection with our foreign asset backed securitization program, at August 31, 2011, we had sold $267.0 million of eligible trade accounts receivable, which represents the face amount of total outstanding receivables at that date. In exchange, we received cash proceeds of $123.7 million, and a net deferred purchase price receivable. At August 31, 2011, the deferred purchase price receivable totaled approximately $143.5 million. In connection with a factoring agreement, we transfer ownership of eligible trade accounts receivable of a foreign subsidiary without recourse to a third party purchaser in exchange for cash. The factoring of trade accounts receivable under this agreement is accounted for as a sale. Proceeds from the transfer reflect the face value of the account less a discount. The discount is recorded as a loss to other expense within the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period of the sale. In October 2011, the factoring agreement was extended through March 31, 2012, at which time it is expected to automatically renew for an additional six month period. The receivables sold pursuant to this factoring agreement are excluded from trade accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are reflected as cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We continue to service, administer and collect the receivables sold under this program. Servicing fees recognized during fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009 were not material, and were recorded to other expense within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We do not record a servicing asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as we estimate the fee it receives in return for its obligation to service these receivables is at fair value. The third party purchaser has no recourse to our assets for failure of debtors to pay when due. We sold $68.5 million, $90.9 million and $137.3 million of trade accounts receivable during fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and in exchange, received cash proceeds of $68.4 million, $90.8 million and $137.2 million, respectively. The resulting losses on the sales of trade accounts receivables sold under this factoring agreement for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009 were not material, and were recorded to other expense within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In fiscal year 2010, we entered into two separate uncommitted accounts receivable sale agreements with banks which originally allowed us and certain of our subsidiaries to elect to sell and the banks to elect to purchase at a discount, on an ongoing basis, up to a maximum of $150.0 million and $75.0 million of specific trade accounts receivable at any one time. The sale programs have been amended to increase the facility limits from $150.0 million to $200.0 million and from $75.0 million to $175.0 million of specific trade accounts receivable at any one time. The programs are accounted for as sales. Net receivables sold under the programs are excluded from trade accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are reflected as cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The $200.0 million and $175.0 million sale programs were amended during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 and the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, respectively, such that the programs no longer have defined termination dates and either party can elect to cancel the agreements by giving prior written notification to the other party of no less than 30 days. We continue servicing the receivables in the program. Servicing fees recognized during fiscal years 2011 and 2010 were not material and are included in other expense within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We do not record a servicing asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as we estimate the fee we receive in return for our obligation to service these receivables is at fair value. During fiscal years 2011 and 2010, we sold $2.4 billion and $0.3 billion of trade accounts receivable under these programs, respectively. In exchange, we received cash proceeds of $2.4 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively. The resulting losses on the sales of trade accounts receivable during fiscal years 2011 and 2010 were not material and were recorded to other expense within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Notes payable and long term debt outstanding at August 31, 2011 and August 31, 2010 are summarized below (in thousands): August 31,2011 August 31,2010 7.750% Senior Notes due 2016 (a) $ 303,501 $ 301,782 8.250% Senior Notes due 2018 (b) 397,521 397,140 5.625% Senior Notes due 2020 (c) 400,000 47 Table of Contents August 31,2011 August 31,2010 Borrowings under credit facilities (d) 72,100 73,750 Borrowings under loans (e) 2,060 342,380 Securitization program obligations (f) 71,436 Miscellaneous borrowings 2 8 Fair value adjustment (g) 11,570 Total notes payable and long term debt 1,186,754 $ 1,186,496 Less current installments of notes payable and long term debt 74,160 167,566 Notes payable and long term debt, less current installments $ 1,112,594 $ 1,018,930 (a) During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009, we issued a total of $312.0 million, seven year, publicly registered senior unsecured notes (the 7.750% Senior Notes) at 96.1% of par, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $300.0 million. The 7.750% Senior Notes mature on July 15, 2016 and pay interest semiannually on January 15 and July 15. Also, the 7.750% Senior Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all other existing and future senior unsecured debt obligations. We are subject to covenants such as limitations on our and or our subsidiaries ability to: consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to, another person; create certain liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; create, incur, issue, assume or guarantee funded debt (which only applies to our restricted subsidiaries); and guarantee any of our indebtedness (which only applies to our subsidiaries). We are also subject to a covenant requiring our repurchase of the 7.750% Senior Notes upon a change of control repurchase event. (b) During the second and third quarters of fiscal year 2008, we issued $250.0 million and $150.0 million, respectively, of ten year, unregistered 8.250% notes at 99.965% of par and 97.5% of par, respectively, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $245.7 million and $148.5 million, respectively. On July 18, 2008, we completed an exchange whereby all of the outstanding unregistered 8.250% Notes were exchanged for registered 8.250% Notes (collectively the 8.250% Senior Notes) that are substantially identical to the unregistered notes except that the 8.250% Senior Notes are registered under the Securities Act and do not have any transfer restrictions, registration rights or rights to additional special interest. The 8.250% Senior Notes mature on March 15, 2018 and pay interest semiannually on March 15 and September 15. The interest rate payable on the 8.250% Senior Notes is subject to adjustment from time to time if the credit ratings assigned to the 8.250% Senior Notes increase or decrease, as provided in the 8.250% Senior Notes. The 8.250% Senior Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all other existing and future senior unsecured debt obligations. We are subject to covenants such as limitations on our and or our subsidiaries ability to: consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to, another person; create certain liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; create, incur, issue, assume or guarantee any funded debt (which only applies to our restricted subsidiaries); and guarantee any of our indebtedness (which only applies to our subsidiaries). We are also subject to a covenant requiring our repurchase of the 8.250% Senior Notes upon a change of control repurchase event. (c) During the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, we issued $400.0 million of ten year 5.625% notes (the 5.625% Senior Notes) at par. The net proceeds from the offering of $400.0 million were used to fully repay the term portion of the Old Credit Facility and partially repay amounts outstanding under our foreign asset backed securitization program. The 5.625% Senior Notes mature on December 15, 2020. Interest on the 5.625% Senior Notes is payable semiannually on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on June 15, 2011. The 5.625% Senior Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all other existing and future senior unsecured debt obligations. We are subject to covenants such as limitations on our and or our subsidiaries ability to: consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to, another person; create certain liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; create, incur, issue, assume or guarantee any funded debt (which only applies to our restricted subsidiaries); and guarantee any of our indebtedness (which only applies to our subsidiaries). We are also subject to a covenant requiring our repurchase of the 5.625% Senior Notes upon a change of control repurchase event. (d) As of August 31, 2011, three of our foreign subsidiaries have entered into credit facilities to finance their future growth and any corresponding working capital needs. The credit facilities are denominated in U.S. dollars. The credit facilities incur interest at fixed and variable rates ranging from 2.3% to 3.6%. (e) During the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, we entered into the Amended and Restated Credit Facility which provides for a revolving credit in the amount of $1.0 billion, subject to potential uncommitted increases up to $1.3 billion, and expires on 48 Table of Contents December 7, 2015. Some or all of the lenders under the Amended and Restated Credit Facility and their affiliates have various other relationships with us and our subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services, including cash management, loans, letter of credit and bank guarantee facilities, investment banking and trust services. We, along with some of our subsidiaries, have entered into foreign exchange contracts and other derivative arrangements with certain of the lenders and their affiliates. In addition, many if not most of the agents and lenders under the Amended and Restated Credit Facility held positions as agent and or lender under our Old Credit Facility. Interest and fees on the Amended and Restated Credit Facility advances are based on our non credit enhanced long term senior unsecured debt rating as determined by S&P and Moodys. Interest is charged at a rate equal to either 0.40% to 1.50% above the base rate or 1.40% to 2.50% above the Eurocurrency rate, where the base rate represents the greatest of Citibank, N.A.s prime rate, 0.50% above the federal funds rate or 1.0% above one month LIBOR, and the Eurocurrency rate represents adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate for the applicable interest period, each as more fully described in this credit agreement. Fees include a facility fee based on the revolving credit commitments of the lenders and a letter of credit fee based on the amount of outstanding letters of credit. We, along with our subsidiaries, are subject to the following financial covenants: (1) a maximum ratio of (a) Debt (as defined in the credit agreement) to (b) Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement) and (2) a minimum ratio of (a) Consolidated EBITDA to (b) interest payable on, and amortization of debt discount in respect of, all Debt (as defined in the credit agreement) and loss on sale of trade accounts receivables pursuant to any of our, or our subsidiaries, securitization programs. In addition, we are subject to other covenants, such as: limitation upon liens; limitation upon mergers, etc.; limitation upon accounting changes; limitation upon subsidiary debt; limitation upon sales, etc. of assets; limitation upon changes in nature of business; payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries; compliance with laws, etc.; payment of taxes, etc.; maintenance of insurance; preservation of corporate existence, etc.; visitation rights; keeping of books; maintenance of properties, etc.; transactions with affiliates; and reporting requirements. During fiscal year 2011, we borrowed and repaid $6.7 billion against the Old Credit Facility and the Amended and Restated Credit Facility under multiple draws. In addition, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, we borrowed and repaid $1.7 billion against the Amended and Restated Credit Facility under multiple draws. A draw in the amount of $400.0 million was made under the term portion of the Old Credit Facility during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, and the outstanding balance was repaid in full during the first quarter of fiscal year 2011. In addition to the loans described above, at August 31, 2011, we have loans outstanding to fund working capital needs. These additional loans total approximately $2.1 million and are denominated in Euros. The loans are due and payable within 12 months and are classified as short term on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. (f) In the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we amended the foreign asset backed securitization program. Prior to execution of the amendment, we recognized interest expense of approximately $0.9 million during fiscal year 2011 associated with the secured borrowings. As a result of the amendment, the accounts receivable transferred under this program qualify for sale treatment and as such are no longer accounted for as secured borrowing. The program was accounted for as a secured borrowing in fiscal year 2010. At August 31, 2010, we had $71.4 million of debt outstanding under the program. In addition, we incurred interest expense of $2.1 million and $3.9 million recorded within the Consolidated Statements of Operations during fiscal years 2010 and 2009, respectively. (g) This amount represents the fair value hedge accounting adjustment related to the 7.750% Senior Notes. For further discussion of our fair value hedges, see Note 12 Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At August 31, 2011 and 2010, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Amended and Restated Credit Facility and our securitization programs. Our working capital requirements and capital expenditures could continue to increase in order to support future expansions of our operations through construction of greenfield operations or acquisitions. It is possible that future expansions may be significant and may require the payment of cash. Future liquidity needs will also depend on fluctuations in levels of inventory and shipments, changes in customer order volumes and timing of expenditures for new equipment. For discussion of our cash management and risk management policies see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We currently anticipate that during the next 12 months, our capital expenditures will be in the range of $300.0 million to $400.0 million, principally for machinery and equipment for new business, including new process technology within our DMS segment, maintenance levels of machinery and equipment, information technology infrastructure upgrades and construction of a new greenfield facility. We believe that our level of resources, which include cash on hand, available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, additional proceeds available under our trade accounts receivable securitization programs and potentially available under our 49 Table of Contents uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs and funds provided by operations, will be adequate to fund these capital expenditures, the payment of any declared quarterly dividends, the acquisition of Telmar Network Technology, Inc. that was announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 and our working capital requirements for the next 12 months. Our $300.0 million asset backed securitization program expires in October 2014 and our $200.0 million foreign asset backed securitization program expires in May 2012, and we may be unable to renew either of these. Our $200.0 million uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale program was amended in the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 and our $175.0 million uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale program was amended on July 27, 2011. The terms of the agreements were amended such that the programs no longer have defined termination dates and either party can elect to cancel the agreements by giving prior written notification to the other party of no less than 30 days. As the sales programs are uncommitted, we can offer no assurance that if we attempt to draw on such programs in the future that we will receive funding from the associated banks which would require us to utilize other available sources of liquidity, including our revolving credit facilities. At August 31, 2011, we had approximately $888.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. As our growth remains predominantly outside of the United States, a significant portion of such cash and cash equivalents are held by our foreign subsidiaries. We estimate that approximately $200.0 million of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries could not be repatriated to the United States without potential income tax consequences. In June 2011, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $200.0 million of our common shares. We repurchased 11,520,137 shares in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 which is the full amount authorized by our Board of Directors. Should we desire to consummate significant additional acquisition opportunities or undertake significant additional expansion activities, our capital needs would increase and could possibly result in our need to increase available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities or access public or private debt and equity markets. There can be no assurance, however, that we would be successful in raising additional debt or equity on terms that we would consider acceptable. See Risk Factors Our amount of debt could significantly increase in the future. Our contractual obligations for short and long term debt arrangements, future interest on notes payable and long term debt, future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating lease arrangements, estimated future benefit payments to plan and capital commitments as of August 31, 2011 are summarized below. We generally do not enter into non cancelable purchase orders for materials until we receive a corresponding purchase commitment from our customer. Non cancelable purchase orders do not typically extend beyond the normal lead time of several weeks at most. Purchase orders beyond this time frame are typically cancelable.

(b) At August 31, 2011, our notes payable and long term debt pay interest at predominantly fixed rates. (c) During the first quarter of fiscal year 2009, we committed $10.0 million to an independent private equity limited partnership which invests in companies that address resource limits in energy, water and materials (commonly referred to as the CleanTech sector). Of that amount, we have invested $5.6 million as of August 31, 2011. The remaining commitment of $4.4 million is callable over the next 24 months by the general partner. As the capital calls have no specified timing, this commitment has been excluded from the above table as we cannot currently determine when such commitment calls will occur. (d) At August 31, 2011, we have $0.5 million and $88.5 million recorded as a current and a long term liability, respectively, for uncertain tax positions. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of payments, or the amount by which our liability for these uncertain tax positions will increase or decrease over time, and accordingly, this liability has been excluded from the above table. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Currency Exchange Risks We transact business in various foreign countries and are, therefore, subject to risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We enter into forward contracts to economically hedge transactional exposure associated with commitments arising from 50 Table of Contents trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable, intercompany transactions and fixed purchase obligations denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective operating entity. We do not intend to use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. All derivative instruments are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at their respective fair values. At August 31, 2011, except for certain foreign currency contracts, with a notional amount outstanding of $329.8 million and a fair value of $2.8 million recorded in prepaid and other current assets and $2.8 million recorded in accrued expenses, we have elected not to prepare and maintain the documentation required for the transactions to qualify as accounting hedges and, therefore, changes in fair value are recorded within our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The aggregate notional amount of outstanding contracts at August 31, 2011 that do not qualify as accounting hedges was $591.6 million. The fair value of these contracts amounted to a $3.5 million asset recorded in prepaid and other current assets and a $4.0 million liability recorded to accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The forward contracts (both those that are designated as hedging instruments and those that are not) will generally expire in less than four months, with 11 months being the maximum term of the contracts outstanding at August 31, 2011. The change in fair value related to contracts designated as hedging instruments will be reflected in the revenue or expense line in which the underlying transaction occurs within our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The change in fair value related to contracts not designated as hedging instruments will be reflected in cost of revenue within our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The forward contracts are denominated in Brazilian reais, British pounds, Chinese yuan renminbis, Euros, Hungarian forints, Indian rupees, Japanese yen, Malaysian ringgits, Mexican pesos, Polish zlotys, Russian rubles, Singapore dollars, Swedish krona and U.S. dollars. Interest Rate Risk A portion of our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our domestic investment portfolio. We do not, and do not intend to, use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. We place cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions. We protect our invested principal funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk. We mitigate these risks by generally investing in investment grade securities and by frequently positioning the portfolio to try to respond appropriately to a reduction in credit rating of any investment issuer, guarantor or depository to levels below the credit ratings dictated by our investment policy. The portfolio typically includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. At August 31, 2011, there were no significant outstanding investments. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, we entered into a series of interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $200.0 million designated as fair value hedges of a portion of our 7.750% Senior Notes. Under these interest rate swaps, we received fixed rate interest payments and paid interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a spread. The effect of these swaps was to convert fixed rate interest expense on a portion of the 7.750% Senior Notes to floating rate interest expense. Gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were recorded to interest expense and offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying 7.750% Senior Notes. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, we terminated the interest rate swaps entered into in connection with the 7.750% Senior Notes with a fair value adjustment of $12.2 million, including accrued interest of $0.6 million at August 31, 2011. The portion of the fair value that is not accrued is recorded as a hedge accounting adjustment to the carrying amount of the 7.750% Senior Notes and is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the 7.750% Senior Notes. The effective interest rate for the 7.750% Senior Notes includes the interest on the notes, the amortization of the hedge accounting adjustment and the accretion of the discount. There were no amounts outstanding at August 31, 2010. We pay interest on several of our outstanding borrowings at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base interest rates. There were $72.1 million in borrowings outstanding under these facilities at August 31, 2011.
