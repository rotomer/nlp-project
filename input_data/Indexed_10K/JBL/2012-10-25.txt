Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We are one of the leading providers of worldwide electronic manufacturing services and solutions. We provide comprehensive electronics design, production and product management services to companies in the aerospace, automotive, computing, consumer, defense, industrial, instrumentation, medical, networking, peripherals, solar, storage and telecommunications industries. The industry in which we operate is composed of companies that provide a range of manufacturing, design and aftermarket services to companies that utilize electronics components. The industry experienced rapid change and growth through the 1990s as an increasing number of companies chose to outsource an increasing portion, and, in some cases, all of their manufacturing requirements. In mid 2001, the industrys revenue declined as a result of significant cut backs in customer production requirements, which was consistent with the overall downturn in the technology sector at the time. In response to this downturn in the technology sector, we implemented restructuring programs to reduce our cost structure and further align our manufacturing capacity with the geographic production demands of our customers. Industry revenues generally began to stabilize in 2003 and companies began to turn more to outsourcing versus internal manufacturing. In addition, the number of industries serviced, as well as the market penetration in certain industries, by electronic manufacturing service providers has increased over the past several years. In mid 2008, the industrys revenue declined when a deteriorating macro economic environment resulted in illiquidity in the overall credit markets and a significant economic downturn in the North American, European and Asian markets. In response to this downturn, we implemented additional restructuring programs to reduce our cost structure and further align our manufacturing capacity with the geographic production demands of our customers. Uncertainty remains regarding the extent and timing of the current economic recovery, particularly in those countries (such as those in much of Europe) where economic conditions have recently regressed. We will continue to monitor the current economic environment and its potential impact on both the customers that we serve as well as our end markets and closely manage our costs and capital resources so that we can respond appropriately as circumstances continue to change. We manage our business and operations in the following three segments: Diversified Manufacturing Services (DMS), Enterprise & Infrastructure (E&I) and High Velocity Systems (HVS). Our DMS segment is composed of dedicated resources to manage higher complexity global products in regulated industries and bring materials and process technologies including design and aftermarket services to our global customers. Our E&I and HVS segments offer integrated global supply chain solutions designed to provide cost effective solutions for our customers. Our E&I segment is focused on our customers primarily in the computing, storage, networking and telecommunication sectors. Our HVS segment is focused on the particular needs of the consumer products industry, including mobility, display, set top boxes and peripheral products such as printers and point of sale terminals. We derive revenue principally from manufacturing services related to electronic equipment built to customer specifications. We also derive revenue to a lesser extent from aftermarket services, design services and excess inventory sales. Revenue from manufacturing services and excess inventory sales is generally recognized, net of estimated product return costs, when goods are shipped; title and risk of ownership have passed; the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. Aftermarket service related revenue is recognized upon completion of the services. Design service related revenue is generally recognized upon completion and acceptance by the respective customer. We assume no significant obligations after product shipment. 32 Table of Contents Our cost of revenue includes the cost of electronic components and other materials that comprise the products we manufacture; the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead; and adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory. As a provider of turnkey manufacturing services, we are responsible for procuring components and other materials. This requires us to commit significant working capital to our operations and to manage the purchasing, receiving, inspection and stocking of materials. Although we bear the risk of fluctuations in the cost of materials and excess scrap, we periodically negotiate cost of materials adjustments with our customers. Net revenue from each product that we manufacture consists of an element based on the costs of materials in that product and an element based on the labor and manufacturing overhead costs allocated to that product. We refer to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on materials costs as material based revenue, and to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on labor and manufacturing overhead costs as manufacturing based revenue. Our gross margin for any product depends on the mix between the cost of materials in the product and the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead allocated to the product. We typically realize higher gross margins on manufacturing based revenue than we do on materials based revenue. As we gain experience in manufacturing a product, we usually achieve increased efficiencies, which result in lower labor and manufacturing overhead costs for that product. Our operating results are impacted by the level of capacity utilization of manufacturing facilities; indirect labor costs; and selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high production volume and high capacity utilization. During periods of low production volume, we generally have idle capacity and reduced operating income margins. We have consistently utilized advanced circuit design, production design and manufacturing technologies to meet the needs of our customers. To support this effort, our engineering staff focuses on developing and refining design and manufacturing technologies to meet specific needs of specific customers. Most of the expenses associated with these customer specific efforts are reflected in our cost of revenue. In addition, our engineers engage in R&D of new technologies that apply generally to our operations. The expenses of these R&D activities are reflected in the research and development line item within our Consolidated Statement of Operations. An important element of our strategy is the expansion of our global production facilities. The majority of our revenue and materials costs worldwide are denominated in U.S. dollars, while our labor and utility costs in operations outside the U.S. are denominated in local currencies. We economically hedge these local currency costs, based on our evaluation of the potential exposure as compared to the cost of the hedge, through the purchase of foreign currency exchange contracts. Changes in the fair market value of such hedging instruments are reflected within the Consolidated Statement of Operations and the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. See Risk Factors We are subject to risks of currency fluctuations and related hedging operations. We currently depend, and expect to continue to depend, upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue and upon their growth, viability and financial stability. A significant reduction in sales to any of our customers or a customer exerting significant pricing and margin pressures on us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In the past, some of our customers have terminated their manufacturing arrangements with us or have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of design, production or product management services ordered from us, including moving a portion of their manufacturing from us in order to more fully utilize their excess internal manufacturing capacity. There can be no assurance that present or future customers will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us or significantly reduce or delay the volume of design, production or product management services ordered from us, or move a portion of their manufacturing from us in order to more fully utilize their excess internal manufacturing capacity. Any such termination of a manufacturing relationship or change, reduction or delay in orders could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. See Risk Factors Because we depend on a limited number of customers, a reduction in sales to any one of our customers could cause a significant decline in our revenue, Risk Factors Most of our customers do not commit to long term production schedules, which makes it difficult for us to schedule production and capital expenditures, and to maximize the efficiency of our manufacturing capacity, Risk Factors Our customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities, delay production or change their sourcing strategy and Note 11 Concentration of Risk and Segment Data to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Summary of Results Net revenues for fiscal year 2012 increased approximately 3.8% to $17.2 billion compared to $16.5 billion for fiscal year 2011 largely due to increased revenue from certain of our existing customers, including new program wins with these customers. The following table sets forth, for the fiscal year ended August 31, certain key operating results and other financial information (in thousands, except per share data). Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2012 2011 2010 Net revenue $ 17,151,941 $ 16,518,827 $ 13,409,411 Gross profit $ 1,309,045 $ 1,254,570 $ 1,004,144 Operating income $ 621,931 $ 578,734 $ 327,566 Net income attributable to Jabil Circuit, Inc $ 394,687 $ 381,063 $ 168,840 Income per share basic $ 1.91 $ 1.78 $ 0.79 Income per share diluted $ 1.87 $ 1.73 $ 0.78 33 Table of Contents Key Performance Indicators Management regularly reviews financial and non financial performance indicators to assess the Companys operating results. The following table sets forth, for the quarterly periods indicated, certain of managements key financial performance indicators. Three Months Ended August 31,2012 May 31,2012 February 29,2012 November 30,2011 Sales cycle 7 days 12 days 15 days 7 days Inventory turns (annualized) 7 turns 7 turns 7 turns 7 turns Days in accounts receivable 23 days 24 days 24 days 23 days Days in inventory 51 days 55 days 54 days 54 days Days in accounts payable 67 days 67 days 63 days 70 days Three Months Ended August 31,2011 May 31,2011 February 28,2011 November 30,2010 Sales cycle 8 days 11 days 11 days 16 days Inventory turns (annualized) 7 turns 7 turns 7 turns 7 turns Days in accounts receivable 23 days 22 days 24 days 26 days Days in inventory 51 days 52 days 53 days 52 days Days in accounts payable 66 days 63 days 66 days 62 days The sales cycle is calculated as the sum of days in accounts receivable and days in inventory, less the days in accounts payable; accordingly, the variance in the sales cycle quarter over quarter is a direct result of changes in these indicators. During the three months ended August 31, 2012, days in accounts receivable decreased one day to 23 days as compared to the prior sequential quarter as a result of the timing of sales and cash collection efforts during the quarter. During the three months ended May 31, 2012, days in accounts receivable remained constant at 24 days as compared to the prior sequential quarter. During the three months ended February 29, 2012, days in accounts receivable increased one day to 24 days as compared to the prior sequential quarter largely as a result of the timing of sales and cash collection efforts during the quarter. During the three months ended November 30, 2011, days in accounts receivable remained constant at 23 days as compared to the prior sequential quarter. During the three months ended August 31, 2012, days in inventory decreased four days to 51 days, as compared to the prior sequential quarter due to continued focus on inventory management and increased sales activity during the quarter. Additionally, inventory decreased as some of the previously increased levels of inventory to support the transition of certain program wins have declined as the programs have been transitioned. During the three months ended May 31, 2012, days in inventory increased one day to 55 days, as compared to the prior sequential quarter, largely due to increased levels of inventory to support the transition of certain program wins. During the three months ended February 29, 2012, days in inventory remained constant at 54 days as compared to the prior sequential quarter. During the three months ended November 30, 2011, days in inventory increased three days to 54 days as compared to the prior sequential quarter largely due to increased levels of inventory to support the transition of certain program wins and higher revenue levels. Inventory turns, on an annualized basis, remained constant at seven turns during each quarter of fiscal year 2012. During the three months ended August 31, 2012, May 31, 2012, February 29, 2012 and November 30, 2011, days in accounts payable remained constant at 67 days, increased four days to 67 days, decreased seven days to 63 days and increased four days to 70 days, respectively, from the prior sequential quarter primarily due to the timing of purchases and cash payments for purchases during the respective quarters. The sales cycle was 7 days during the three months ended August 31, 2012, 12 days during the three months ended May 31, 2012, 15 days during the three months ended February 29, 2012 and 7 days during the three months ended November 30, 2011. The changes in the sales cycle are due to the changes in accounts receivable, accounts payable and inventory that are discussed above. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and 34 Table of Contents related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. Management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances. We have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. For further discussion of our significant accounting policies, refer to Note 1 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition We derive revenue principally from manufacturing services related to electronic equipment built to customer specifications. We also derive revenue to a lesser extent from aftermarket services, design services and excess inventory sales. Revenue from manufacturing services and excess inventory sales is generally recognized, net of estimated product return costs, when goods are shipped; title and risk of ownership have passed; the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. Aftermarket service related revenue is recognized upon completion of the services. Design service related revenue is generally recognized upon completion and acceptance by the respective customer. We assume no significant obligations after product shipment. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts related to receivables not expected to be collected from our customers. This allowance is based on managements assessment of specific customer balances, considering the age of receivables and financial stability of the customer. If there is an adverse change in the financial condition and circumstances of our customers, or if actual defaults are higher than provided for, an addition to the allowance may be necessary. Inventory Valuation We purchase inventory based on forecasted demand and record inventory at the lower of cost or market. Management regularly assesses inventory valuation based on current and forecasted usage, customer inventory related contractual obligations and other lower of cost or market considerations. If actual market conditions or our customers product demands are less favorable than those projected, additional valuation adjustments may be necessary. Long Lived Assets We review property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of property, plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the undiscounted projected cash flows that the asset(s) or asset group(s) are expected to generate. If the carrying amount of an asset or an asset group is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the long lived asset or asset group over its respective fair value, which is generally determined as either the present value of estimated future cash flows or the appraised value. The impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management, including revenue and cash flow projections. Circumstances that may lead to impairment of property, plant and equipment include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand and the restructuring of our operations resulting from a change in our business strategy or adverse economic conditions. For further discussion of our current restructuring program, refer to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Restructuring and Impairment Charges. We have recorded intangible assets, including goodwill, in connection with business acquisitions. Estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are determined by management based on an assessment of the period over which the asset is expected to contribute to future cash flows. The fair value of acquired amortizable intangible assets impacts the amounts recorded as goodwill. We perform a goodwill impairment analysis using the two step method on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting units carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. We determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an average weighting of both projected discounted future results and the use of comparative market multiples. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and a second test is performed to measure the amount of loss, if any. We perform an indefinite lived intangible asset impairment analysis on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount to the fair value. We determine the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets principally based on a variation of the income approach, known as the relief from royalty methodology. If the carrying amount of the indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the indefinite lived intangible asset is considered impaired. 35 Table of Contents We completed our annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 and determined that the fair values of our reporting units and the indefinite lived intangible assets are substantially in excess of the carrying values and that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test. Retirement Benefits We have pension and postretirement benefit costs and liabilities in certain foreign locations that are developed from actuarial valuations. Actuarial valuations require management to make certain judgments and estimates of discount rates, compensation rate increases and return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions on a regular basis taking into consideration current market conditions and historical market data. The discount rate is used to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date. This rate represents the market rate for high quality fixed income investments. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. When considering the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets, we take into account current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on plan assets. Other assumptions include demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover. For further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefits, refer to Note 8 Postretirement and Other Employee Benefits to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes We estimate our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, a process that includes estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities. We must also make judgments regarding the ability to realize the deferred tax assets. The carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets that we do not believe meet the more likely than not criteria. We assess whether an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return meets the threshold for recognition and measurement in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our judgments regarding future taxable income as well as tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return may change due to changes in market conditions, changes in tax laws or other factors. If our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future, the valuation allowances and or tax reserves established may be increased or decreased, resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) completed its field examination of our tax returns for the fiscal years 2003 through 2005 and issued a Revenue Agents Report (RAR) on April 30, 2010 proposing adjustments primarily related to the IRS contentions that (1) certain corporate expenses relate to services provided to foreign affiliates and therefore must be charged to those affiliates, and (2) valuable intangible property was transferred to certain foreign affiliates without charge. If the IRS ultimately prevails in its positions, our income tax payment due for the fiscal years 2003 through 2005 would be approximately an additional $69.3 million before utilization of any tax attributes arising in periods subsequent to fiscal year 2005. Also, the IRS has proposed interest and penalties with respect to fiscal years 2003 through 2005. The IRS also completed its field examination for fiscal years 2006 through 2008 and issued a RAR on April 25, 2012. The proposed adjustments primarily related to the carryforward impact of the adjustments proposed by the IRS for fiscal years 2003 through 2005 related to valuable intangible property transferred to certain foreign affiliates without charge in prior years. Due to the utilization of tax attributes, including net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards and NOL carrybacks, there is no proposed additional tax payment, interest, or penalties contained in the RAR with respect to fiscal years 2006 through 2008. In addition, the IRS will likely make similar claims in future audits with respect to these types of transactions (at this time, determination of the additional income tax due for these later years is not practicable). We also anticipate that the IRS may seek to impose interest and penalties in subsequent years with respect to the same types of issues. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and are vigorously contesting this matter through applicable IRS and judicial procedures, as appropriate. As the final resolution of the proposed adjustments remains uncertain, we continue to provide for the uncertain tax position based on the more likely than not standards. While the resolution of the issues may result in tax liabilities, interest and penalties, which are significantly higher than the amounts provided for this matter, management currently believes that the resolution will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Despite this belief, an unfavorable resolution, particularly if the IRS successfully asserts similar claims for later years, could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition (particularly during the quarter in which any adjustment is recorded or any tax is due or paid). For further discussion related to our income taxes, refer to Note 4 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Risk Factors We are subject to the risk of increased taxes.

Our net revenue increased 3.8% to $17.2 billion for fiscal year 2012, up from $16.5 billion in fiscal year 2011. Specific increases include a 48% increase in the sale of specialized services products; a 7% increase in the sale of instrumentation and healthcare products and a 2% increase in the sale of industrial and Clean Tech products. These increases were partially offset by a 14% decrease in the sale of HVS products and a 2% decrease in the sale of E&I products. The increases are primarily due to increased revenue from certain of our existing customers, most notably in DMS, including new program wins with these customers. The decreases in E&I and HVS revenues are primarily due to a decline in the end market demand for certain customer products in these segments, partially offset by an increase in the sale of printer and storage products due to new program wins. Generally, we assess revenue on a global customer basis regardless of whether the growth is associated with organic growth or as a result of an acquisition. Accordingly, we do not differentiate or report separately revenue increases generated by acquisitions as opposed to existing business. In addition, the added cost structures associated with our acquisitions have historically been relatively insignificant when compared to our overall cost structure. The distribution of revenue across our sectors has fluctuated, and will continue to fluctuate, as a result of numerous factors, including but not limited to the following: fluctuations in customer demand as a result of recessionary conditions; efforts to de emphasize the economic performance of certain sectors, most specifically, our former automotive and display sectors; seasonality in our business; and business growth from new and existing customers. On September 1, 2010, we reorganized our business into the following three segments: DMS, E&I and HVS. In conjunction with this reorganization, there have been certain reclassifications made within the reported sectors for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2010. 37 Table of Contents The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, revenue by segment expressed as a percentage of net revenue: Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2012 2011 2010 DMS Specialized Services 24 % 17 % 12 % Industrial & CleanTech 12 % 12 % 13 % Instrumentation & Healthcare 8 % 7 % 7 % Total DMS 44 % 36 % 32 % Total E&I 29 % 32 % 32 % Total HVS 27 % 32 % 36 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % Foreign source revenue represented 85.6% of our net revenue for fiscal year 2012 and 86.0% of net revenue for fiscal year 2011. We currently expect our foreign source revenue to slightly decrease as compared to current levels over the course of the next 12 months. Gross Profit. Gross profit remained constant at $1.3 billion (7.6% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011. Selling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $644.5 million (3.7% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2012 compared to $590.6 million (3.6% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2011. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue between fiscal years 2012 and 2011 is due to additional salary and salary related expenses associated with increased headcount to support the continued growth of our business and additional selling, general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions, including F I Holding Company (which directly or indirectly wholly owns certain French and Italian operations) during the second quarter of fiscal year 2011 and Telmar Network Technology, Inc. (Telmar) during the second quarter of fiscal year 2012. Research and Development. Research and development (R&D) expenses for fiscal year 2012 remained relatively constant at $25.8 million (0.2% of net revenue) from $25.0 million (0.2% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2011. Amortization of Intangibles. We recorded $16.8 million of amortization of intangibles in fiscal year 2012 as compared to $22.1 million in fiscal year 2011. The decrease is primarily attributable to certain intangible assets that became fully amortized since August 31, 2011, partially offset by an increase to amortization expense associated with the definite lived intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of Telmar. For additional information regarding purchased intangibles, see Acquisitions and Expansion below, Note 1(f) Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Note 6 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Note 14 Business Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Settlement of Receivables and Related Charges. We recorded a loss on settlement of receivables and related charges of $13.6 million during fiscal year 2011. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, we completed our acquisition of F I Holding Company, which directly or indirectly wholly owns Competence France Holdings SAS, a French entity which wholly owns Competence France SAS, and Competence EMEA S.r.l., an Italian entity which wholly owns Competence Italia S.r.l. (Competence France Holdings SAS, Competence France SAS, Competence EMEA S.r.l. and Competence Italia S.r.l. are collectively referred to as the Competence Sites herein). The Competence Sites were our former operations and were previously disposed of on July 16, 2010. Refer to Note 13 Loss on Disposal of Subsidiaries to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, immediately prior to the acquisition of the Competence Sites, we recognized a charge of $12.7 million in order to record $35.0 million in receivables and other relationships with the Competence Sites at their respective fair values. In addition, we recognized acquisition costs and other related charges of $0.9 million during the second quarter of fiscal year 2011. Refer to Note 14 Business Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. Loss on Disposal of Subsidiaries. We recorded a loss on disposal of subsidiaries of $23.9 million during fiscal year 2011. Other Expense. Other expense increased to $8.9 million for fiscal year 2012 compared to $3.0 million for fiscal year 2011, respectively. The increase was primarily due to an incremental loss of $2.3 million recognized during fiscal year 2012 under the foreign asset backed securitization program, largely due to such expense being recorded to interest expense during a portion of the comparable period (as the program was accounted for as a secured borrowing until May 11, 2011) and $3.4 million of expense 38 Table of Contents recognized during the fiscal year 2012 related to fair value adjustments associated with customer warrants. Refer to Note 2 Trade Accounts Receivable Securitization and Sale Programs to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the foreign asset backed securitization program. Interest Income. Interest income decreased to $2.0 million for fiscal year 2012 compared to $3.1 million for fiscal year 2011. The decrease during these periods was primarily due to reduced cash investments. Interest Expense. We recorded $106.1 million of interest expense in fiscal year 2012 as compared to $97.7 million in fiscal year 2011. The increase was primarily due to increased borrowings associated with our five year unsecured credit facility amended as of December 7, 2010 (the Old Amended and Restated Credit Facility) which was further amended and restated on March 19, 2012 by the Amended and Restated Credit Facility. These increases were partially offset by the losses recognized in connection with the asset backed securitization programs that were recorded to interest expense during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2011 because the asset backed securitization programs were accounted for as secured borrowings for a portion of the period. Refer to Note 2 Trade Accounts Receivable Securitization and Sale Programs to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the asset backed securitization programs. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of 22.2% for fiscal year 2012, as compared to an effective tax rate of 20.4% for fiscal year 2011. The effective tax rate increased from the previous period primarily due to the mix of tax rates and the expiration of tax incentives in various jurisdictions in which we do business, partially offset by the release of tax reserves related to the settlement of a non U.S. governmental tax audit in fiscal year 2012 and no tax benefit related to the acquisition losses of F I Holding Company in fiscal year 2011. Most of our international operations have historically been taxed at a lower rate than in the U.S., due to lower statutory tax rates and tax incentives granted to our sites in Brazil, China, Hungary, Malaysia, Poland, Singapore and Vietnam. The Hungarian incentive and the majority of the Chinese incentives expired during fiscal year 2012. The remaining material tax incentives expire at various dates through 2020. Such tax incentives are subject to conditions with which we expect to continue to comply. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Income Taxes, Risk Factors We are subject to the risk of increased taxes and Note 4 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements further discussion. Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2011 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2010 Net Revenue. Our net revenue increased 23.2% to $16.5 billion for fiscal year 2011, up from $13.4 billion in fiscal year 2010. Specific increases include a 76% increase in the sale of specialized services products; a 31% increase in the sale of instrumentation and healthcare products; a 19% increase in the sale of industrial and CleanTech products; an 18% increase in the sale of E&I products; and an 11% increase in the sale of HVS products. These increases for fiscal year 2011 are primarily due to increased revenue from certain of our existing customers, including new program wins with these customers. Foreign source revenue represented 86.0% of our net revenue for fiscal year 2011 and 84.7% of net revenue for fiscal year 2010. For further discussion of our net revenues, refer to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2012 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2011 Net Revenue. Gross Profit. Gross profit increased to $1.3 billion (7.6% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2011 from $1.0 billion (7.5% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2010. The increase in gross profit on an absolute basis and as a percentage of net revenue from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to increased revenue from certain of our existing customers, including new program wins with these customers, which allow us to better utilize capacity and absorb fixed costs, an increased focus on controlling costs and improving productivity and additional growth in the DMS segment, which typically has higher margins than the E&I and HVS segments. Selling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses remained relatively constant at $590.6 million (3.6% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2011 compared to $589.7 million (4.4% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2010. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue between fiscal years 2011 and 2010 is due to an increased focus on controlling costs, as well as being able to better absorb fixed costs as revenue levels increase. Research and Development. R&D expenses for fiscal year 2011 decreased to $25.0 million (0.2% of net revenue) from $28.1 million (0.2% of net revenue) for fiscal year 2010. The decrease is primarily due to a greater portion of engineering resources working on customer funded design projects and R&D activity being moved to our design centers in lower cost geographies. Amortization of Intangibles. We recorded $22.1 million of amortization of intangibles in fiscal year 2011 as compared to $25.9 million in fiscal year 2010. The decrease is primarily attributable to certain intangible assets that became fully amortized since August 31, 2010. For additional information regarding purchased intangibles, see Acquisitions and Expansion below, Note 1(f) Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Note 6 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 39 Table of Contents Restructuring and Impairment Charges. a. 2009 Restructuring Plan During fiscal year 2011, we reversed $0.1 million of previously recognized restructuring and impairment costs, compared to charges of $7.7 million of restructuring and impairment costs recorded during fiscal year 2010 to our Consolidated Statement of Operations. b. 2006 Restructuring Plan During fiscal year 2011, we recorded approximately $0.7 million of restructuring and impairment costs, compared to charges of $0.5 million of restructuring and impairment charges recorded during fiscal year 2010. The restructuring and impairment costs for fiscal year 2011 are primarily related to lease commitment costs. Settlement of Receivables and Related Charges. We recorded a loss on settlement of receivables and related charges of $13.6 million during fiscal year 2011. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, we completed our acquisition of F I Holding Company, which directly or indirectly wholly owns Competence France Holdings SAS, a French entity which wholly owns Competence France SAS, and Competence EMEA S.r.l., an Italian entity which wholly owns Competence Italia S.r.l. (Competence France Holdings SAS, Competence France SAS, Competence EMEA S.r.l. and Competence Italia S.r.l. are collectively referred to as the Competence Sites herein). The Competence Sites were our former operations and were previously disposed of on July 16, 2010. Refer to Note 13 Loss on Disposal of Subsidiaries to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, immediately prior to the acquisition of the Competence Sites, we recognized a charge of $12.7 million in order to record $35.0 million in receivables and other relationships with the Competence Sites at their respective fair values. In addition, we recognized acquisition costs and other related charges of $0.9 million during the second quarter of fiscal year 2011. Refer to Note 14 Business Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. Loss on Disposal of Subsidiaries. We recorded a loss on disposal of subsidiaries of $23.9 million during fiscal year 2011 and $24.6 million during fiscal year 2010. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2010, we sold the operations of Jabil Circuit Automotive, SAS, an automotive electronic manufacturing subsidiary located in Western Europe to an unrelated third party. In connection with this sale, we recorded a loss on disposition of approximately $15.7 million, which includes approximately $4.2 million in transaction costs incurred in connection with the sale during the three months ended November 30, 2009. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010, we sold F I Holding Company, which directly or indirectly wholly owns the Competence Sites, to an unrelated third party. In connection with this transaction, we provided an aggregate $25.0 million working capital loan to the disposed operations. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010, we recorded a charge of $8.9 million to loss on disposal of subsidiaries within the Consolidated Statement of Operations, including $1.7 million of transaction related costs and $6.5 million in order to record the working capital loan at its respective fair market value at August 31, 2010 based upon a discounted cash flow analysis. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, we recorded a charge of $23.9 million to loss on disposal of subsidiaries within the Consolidated Statement of Operations, including $18.5 million to fully write off the remaining balance of the working capital loan and $5.4 million to write off a purchase price related receivable that we were due from the third party purchaser as they were deemed no longer collectible. Refer to Note 13 Loss on Disposal of Subsidiaries to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Other Expense. Other expense remained relatively constant at $3.0 million for fiscal year 2011 compared to $4.1 million for fiscal year 2010, respectively. Interest Income. Interest income remained relatively constant at $3.1 million for fiscal year 2011 compared to $3.0 million for fiscal year 2010. Interest Expense. We recorded $97.7 million of interest expense in fiscal year 2011 as compared to $79.2 million in fiscal year 2010. The increase was primarily due to interest associated with the issuance of our 5.625% Senior Notes during the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 and the refinancing of the credit facility dated as of July 19, 2007 (the Old Credit Facility) at market rates, which were higher than the Old Credit Facilitys, during the second quarter of fiscal year 2011. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of 20.4% for fiscal year 2011, as compared to an effective tax rate of 30.9% for fiscal year 2010. The effective tax rate differs from the previous period due to the amount of earnings, mix of tax rates, and increase in tax incentives in the various jurisdictions in which we do business and the sale of F I Holding Company (which owns the Competence Sites) in fiscal year 2010, partially offset by the acquisition of F I Holding Company in fiscal year 2011. Most of our international operations have historically been taxed at a lower rate than in the U.S., primarily due to tax incentives granted to our sites in Brazil, China, Hungary, Malaysia, Poland, Singapore and Vietnam. The material tax incentives 40 Table of Contents expire at various dates through 2020. Such tax incentives are subject to conditions with which we expect to continue to comply. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Income Taxes, Risk Factors We are subject to the risk of increased taxes and Note 4 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements further discussion. Non U.S. GAAP Core Financial Measures The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations include certain non U.S. GAAP financial measures as identified in the reconciliation below. The non U.S. GAAP financial measures disclosed herein do not have standard meaning and may vary from the non U.S. GAAP financial measures used by other companies or how we may calculate those measures in other instances from time to time. Non U.S. GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Also, our core financial measures should not be construed as an inference by us that our future results will be unaffected by those items which are excluded from our core financial measures. Management believes that the non U.S. GAAP core financial measures set forth below are useful to facilitate evaluating the past and future performance of our ongoing manufacturing operations over multiple periods on a comparable basis by excluding the effects of the amortization of intangibles, distressed customer charges, stock based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and impairment charges, settlement of receivables and related charges and loss on disposal of subsidiaries. Among other uses, management uses non U.S. GAAP core financial measures as a factor in determining certain employee performance when determining incentive compensation. We are reporting core operating income and core earnings to provide investors with an additional method for assessing operating income and earnings, by presenting what we believe are our core manufacturing operations. A significant portion (based on the respective values) of the items that are excluded for purposes of calculating core operating income and core earnings also impacted certain balance sheet assets, resulting in a portion of an asset being written off without a corresponding recovery of cash we may have previously spent with respect to the asset. In the case of restructuring charges, we may be making associated cash payments in the future. In addition, although, for purposes of calculating core operating income and core earnings, we exclude stock based compensation expense (which we anticipate continuing to incur in the future) because it is a non cash expense, the associated stock issued may result in an increase in our outstanding shares of stock, which may result in the dilution of our stockholders ownership interest. We encourage you to evaluate these items and the limitations for purposes of analysis in excluding them. Included in the table below is a reconciliation of the non U.S. GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures as provided in our Consolidated Financial Statements (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2012 2011 2010 Operating income (U.S. GAAP) $ 621,931 $ 578,734 $ 327,566 Amortization of intangibles 16,825 22,051 25,934 Distressed customer charges 16,014 Stock based compensation and related charges 81,409 76,230 104,609 Restructuring and impairment charges 628 8,217 Settlement of receivables and related charges 13,607 Loss on disposal of subsidiaries 23,944 24,604 Core operating income (Non U.S. GAAP) $ 736,179 $ 715,194 $ 490,930 Net income attributable to Jabil Circuit, Inc.

Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the operating results of each business from the date of acquisition. See Risk Factors We have on occasion not achieved, and may not in the future achieve, expected profitability from our acquisitions. Liquidity and Capital Resources At August 31, 2012, we had cash and cash equivalent balances totaling $1.2 billion, total notes payable and long term debt of $1.7 billion, $1.3 billion in available liquidity under our revolving credit facilities and up to $184.3 million in available liquidity under our trade accounts receivable securitization and uncommitted sale programs. As the sale programs are uncommitted, we can offer no assurance that if we attempt to draw on such programs in the future that we will receive funding from the associated banks which would require us to utilize other available sources of liquidity, including our revolving credit facilities. Cash Flows The following table sets forth, for the fiscal years ended August 31 selected consolidated cash flow information (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2012 2011 2010 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 634,226 $ 828,009 $ 427,410 Net cash used in investing activities (605,870 ) (426,278 ) (440,257 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 317,358 (267,722 ) (100,280 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (17,069 ) 10,273 (18,816 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 328,645 $ 144,282 $ (131,943 ) Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2012 was approximately $634.2 million. This resulted primarily from net income of $396.1 million, $353.5 million in non cash depreciation and amortization expense and $81.4 million in stock based compensation expense; which were partially offset by a $141.6 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a $53.3 million increase in inventories. The increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily driven by increases in the deferred purchase price notes receivable under our asset backed securitization programs due to higher levels of sales and the timing of cash funding provided by the unaffiliated conduits and financial institutions discussed further below and advanced deposits made for machinery and equipment purchases and facility expansion primarily within our DMS segment. The increase in inventories was primarily to support the transition of certain program wins. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2012 was $605.9 million. This consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $497.7 million principally for machinery and equipment for new business, particularly within our DMS segment, maintenance levels of machinery and equipment and information technology infrastructure upgrades and $125.1 million of net cash paid to acquire Telmar. These increases were partially offset by $16.4 million of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment. Net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year 2012 was $317.4 million. This resulted from our receipt of approximately $0.5 billion of proceeds from borrowings under the 4.700% Senior Notes and $8.7 billion of proceeds from borrowings under existing debt agreements, which primarily included $8.3 billion of borrowings under the Old Amended and Restated Credit Facility and the Amended and Restated Credit Facility. This was offset by repayments in an aggregate amount of approximately $8.7 billion during fiscal year 2012, which primarily included an aggregate of $8.3 billion of repayments under the Old Amended and Restated Credit Facility and the Amended and Restated Credit Facility. In addition, we paid $71.0 million to repurchase 3,212,418 of our common shares, $65.2 million in dividends to stockholders, $20.5 million related to the purchase of a portion of our noncontrolling interest of a subsidiary within our DMS segment and $31.2 million to the IRS on behalf of certain employees to satisfy minimum tax obligations related to the vesting of certain restricted stock awards (as consideration for these payments to the IRS, we withheld $31.2 million of employee owned common stock related to this vesting) during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2012. 44 Table of Contents Sources We may need to finance day to day working capital needs, as well as future growth and any corresponding working capital needs, with additional borrowings under our Amended and Restated Credit Facility (which is further discussed in the following paragraphs) and our other revolving credit facilities described below, as well as additional public and private offerings of our debt and equity. Currently, we have a shelf registration statement with the SEC registering the potential sale of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities in the future, from time to time over the three years following the registration, to augment our liquidity and capital resources. The current shelf registration statement will expire in the first quarter of fiscal year 2015 at which time we currently anticipate filing a new shelf registration statement. Any future sale or issuance of equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to current or future shareholders. Further, we may issue debt securities that have rights and privileges senior to those of holders of ordinary shares, and the terms of this debt could impose restrictions on operations, increase debt service obligations, limit our flexibility as a result of debt service requirements and restrictive covenants, potentially negatively affect our credit ratings, and limit our ability to access additional capital or execute our business strategy. We continue to assess our capital structure and evaluate the merits of redeploying available cash to reduce existing debt or repurchase common shares. We regularly sell designated pools of trade accounts receivable under two asset backed securitization programs, a factoring program and two uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs (collectively referred to herein as the programs). Transfers of the receivables under the programs are accounted for as sales and, accordingly, net receivables sold under the programs are excluded from accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are reflected as cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Discussion of each of the programs is included in the following paragraphs. In addition, refer to Note 2 Trade Accounts Receivable Securitization and Sale Programs to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the programs. a. Asset Backed Securitization Programs We continuously sell designated pools of trade accounts receivable under our asset backed securitization programs to special purpose entities, which in turn sell 100% of the receivables to conduits administered by unaffiliated financial institutions (for the North American asset backed securitization program) and an unaffiliated financial institution (for the foreign asset backed securitization program). Any portion of the purchase price for the receivables which is not paid in cash upon the sale taking place is recorded as a deferred purchase price receivable, which is paid from available cash as payments on the receivables are collected. Net cash proceeds up to a maximum of $300.0 million for the North American asset backed securitization program and $200.0 million for the foreign asset backed securitization program are available at any one time. The foreign asset backed securitization program was amended on May 15, 2012 to expire on May 15, 2015. In connection with our asset backed securitization programs, at August 31, 2012, we had sold $861.9 million of eligible trade accounts receivable, which represents the face amount of total outstanding receivables at that date. In exchange, we received cash proceeds of $379.4 million, and a net deferred purchase price receivable. At August 31, 2012, the net deferred purchase price receivable totaled approximately $477.4 million. The deferred purchase price receivable was recorded initially at fair value as prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. b. Trade Accounts Receivable Factoring Agreement In connection with a factoring agreement, we transfer ownership of eligible trade accounts receivable of a foreign subsidiary without recourse to a third party purchaser in exchange for cash. Proceeds from the transfer reflect the face value of the account less a discount. In April 2012, the factoring agreement was extended through September 30, 2012, at which time it was automatically renewed for an additional six month period. During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2012, we sold $76.0 million of trade accounts receivable and received cash proceeds of $76.0 million. c. Trade Accounts Receivable Sale Programs In connection with two separate uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale agreements with banks, the second of which was entered into during the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, we may elect to sell and the banks may elect to purchase at a discount, on an ongoing basis, up to a maximum of $250.0 million and $40.0 million of specific trade accounts receivable at any one time. The $250.0 million uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale agreement has no defined termination date and either party can elect to cancel the agreement by giving prior written notification to the other party of no less than 30 days. The $40.0 million uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale agreement was amended during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012. Prior 45 Table of Contents to the amendment, the capacity was $50.0 million. The $40.0 million agreement will expire no later than June 1, 2015, though either party can elect to cancel the agreement by giving prior written notification to the other party of no less than 30 days. A $200.0 million uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale agreement, which we were previously party to, was terminated on May 31, 2012. During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2012, we sold $2.1 billion of trade accounts receivable under these programs and we received cash proceeds of $2.1 billion. Notes payable and long term debt outstanding at August 31, 2012 and August 31, 2011 are summarized below (in thousands): August 31,2012 August 31,2011 7.750% Senior Notes due 2016 (a) $ 305,221 $ 303,501 8.250% Senior Notes due 2018 (b) 397,903 397,521 5.625% Senior Notes due 2020 (c) 400,000 400,000 4.700% Senior Notes due 2022 (d) 500,000 Borrowings under credit facilities (e) 8,000 72,100 Borrowings under loans (f) 56,036 2,062 Fair value adjustment related to terminated interest rate swap on the 7.750% Senior Notes (g) 9,197 11,570 Total notes payable and long term debt 1,676,357 1,186,754 Less current installments of notes payable and long term debt 18,031 74,160 Notes payable and long term debt, less current installments $ 1,658,326 $ 1,112,594 (a) During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009, we issued the 7.750% Senior Notes at 96.1% of par, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $300.0 million. The 7.750% Senior Notes mature on July 15, 2016 and pay interest semiannually on January 15 and July 15. Also, the 7.750% Senior Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all other existing and future senior unsecured debt obligations. We are subject to covenants such as limitations on our and or our subsidiaries ability to: consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to, another person; create certain liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; create, incur, issue, assume or guarantee funded debt (which only applies to our restricted subsidiaries); and guarantee any of our indebtedness (which only applies to our subsidiaries). We are also subject to a covenant requiring our repurchase of the 7.750% Senior Notes upon a change of control repurchase event. (b) During the second and third quarters of fiscal year 2008, we issued $250.0 million and $150.0 million, respectively, of ten year, unregistered 8.250% notes at 99.965% of par and 97.5% of par, respectively, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $245.7 million and $148.5 million, respectively. On July 18, 2008, we completed an exchange whereby all of the outstanding unregistered 8.250% Notes were exchanged for the 8.250% Senior Notes that are substantially identical to the unregistered notes except that the 8.250% Senior Notes are registered under the Securities Act and do not have any transfer restrictions, registration rights or rights to additional special interest. The 8.250% Senior Notes mature on March 15, 2018 and pay interest semiannually on March 15 and September 15. The interest rate payable on the 8.250% Senior Notes is subject to adjustment from time to time if the credit ratings assigned to the 8.250% Senior Notes increase or decrease, as provided in the 8.250% Senior Notes. The 8.250% Senior Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all other existing and future senior unsecured debt obligations. We are subject to covenants such as limitations on our and or our subsidiaries ability to: consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to, another person; create certain liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; create, incur, issue, assume or guarantee any funded debt (which only applies to our restricted subsidiaries); and guarantee any of our indebtedness (which only applies to our subsidiaries). We are also subject to a covenant requiring our repurchase of the 8.250% Senior Notes upon a change of control repurchase event. (c) During the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, we issued the 5.625% Senior Notes at par. The net proceeds from the offering of $400.0 million were used to fully repay the term portion of the Old Credit Facility and partially repay amounts outstanding under our foreign asset backed securitization program. The 5.625% Senior Notes mature on December 15, 2020. Interest on the 5.625% Senior Notes is payable semiannually on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on June 15, 2011. The 5.625% Senior Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all other existing and future senior unsecured debt obligations. We are subject to covenants such as limitations on our and or our subsidiaries ability to: consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to, another person; create certain liens; enter into sale and 46 Table of Contents leaseback transactions; create, incur, issue, assume or guarantee any funded debt (which only applies to our restricted subsidiaries); and guarantee any of our indebtedness (which only applies to our subsidiaries). We are also subject to a covenant requiring our repurchase of the 5.625% Senior Notes upon a change of control repurchase event. (d) During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, we issued the 4.700% Senior Notes at 99.992% of par. The net proceeds from the offering of $500.0 million were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving Amended and Restated Credit Facility and for general corporate purposes. The 4.700% Senior Notes mature on September 15, 2022 and pay interest semiannually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2013. The 4.700% Senior Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all other existing and future senior unsecured debt obligations. We are subject to covenants such as limitations on our and or our subsidiaries ability to: consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to, another person; create certain liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; create, incur, issue, assume or guarantee any funded debt (which only applies to our restricted subsidiaries); and guarantee any of our indebtedness (which only applies to our subsidiaries). We are also subject to a covenant requiring our repurchase of the 4.700% Senior Notes upon a change of control repurchase event. (e) As of August 31, 2012, six of our foreign subsidiaries have credit facilities that finance their future growth and any corresponding working capital needs. Five of the credit facilities are denominated in U.S. dollars and one is denominated in Brazilian reais. The credit facilities incur interest at fixed and variable rates ranging from 2.1% to 12.4%. On March 19, 2012, we entered into the Amended and Restated Credit Facility, which amended and restated the Old Amended and Restated Credit Facility. The Amended and Restated Credit Facility provides for a revolving credit facility in the initial amount of $1.3 billion, which may, subject to lenders discretion, potentially be increased up to $1.6 billion and expires on March 19, 2017. Interest and fees on the Amended and Restated Credit Facility advances are based on our non credit enhanced long term senior unsecured debt rating as determined by S&P and Moodys. Interest is charged at a rate equal to either 0.175% to 0.850% above the base rate or 1.175% to 1.850% above the Eurocurrency rate, where the base rate represents the greatest of Citibank, N.A.s prime rate, 0.50% above the federal funds rate, or 1.0% above one month LIBOR, and the Eurocurrency rate represents adjusted LIBOR for the applicable interest period, each as more fully described in the Amended and Restated Credit Facility agreement. Fees include a facility fee based on the revolving credit commitments of the lenders and a letter of credit fee based on the amount of outstanding letters of credit. We, along with our subsidiaries, are subject to the following financial covenants: (1) a maximum ratio of (a) Debt (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Facility agreement) to (b) Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Facility agreement) and (2) a minimum ratio of (a) Consolidated EBITDA to (b) interest payable on, and amortization of debt discount in respect of, all Debt (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Facility agreement) and loss on sale of accounts receivables. In addition, we are subject to other covenants, such as: limitation upon liens; limitation upon mergers, etc.; limitation upon accounting changes; limitation upon subsidiary debt; limitation upon sales, etc. of assets; limitation upon changes in nature of business; payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries; compliance with laws, etc.; payment of taxes, etc.; maintenance of insurance; preservation of corporate existence, etc.; visitation rights; keeping of books; maintenance of properties, etc.; transactions with affiliates; and reporting requirements. During fiscal year 2012, we borrowed and repaid $8.3 billion against the Old Amended and Restated Credit Facility and the Amended and Restated Credit Facility under multiple draws. In addition, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, we borrowed and repaid $1.6 billion against the Amended and Restated Credit Facility under multiple draws. (f) On May 2, 2012, we entered into a master lease agreement with a variable interest entity (the VIE) whereby we sell to and subsequently lease back from the VIE up to $60.0 million in certain machinery and equipment for a period of up to five years. In connection with this transaction, we hold a variable interest in the VIE, which was designed to hold debt obligations payable to third party creditors. The proceeds from such debt obligations are utilized to finance the purchase of the machinery and equipment that is then leased by us. We are the primary beneficiary of the VIE as we have both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Therefore, we consolidate the financial statements of the VIE and eliminate all intercompany transactions. At August 31, 2012, the VIE had approximately $55.1 million of total assets, of which approximately $53.6 million was comprised of a note receivable due from us, and approximately $54.8 million of total liabilities, of which approximately $54.7 million were debt obligations to the third party creditors (as the VIE has utilized approximately $54.7 million of the $60.0 million debt obligation capacity). The third party creditors have recourse to our general credit only in the event that we default on our obligations under the terms of the master lease agreement. In addition, the assets held by the VIE can be used only to settle the obligations of the VIE. 47 Table of Contents In addition to the loans described above, at August 31, 2012, we have borrowings outstanding to fund working capital needs. These additional loans total approximately $1.2 million and are denominated in Euros. The loans are due and payable within 12 months and are classified as short term on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. (g) This amount represents the fair value hedge accounting adjustment related to the 7.750% Senior Notes. For further discussion of our fair value hedges, see Note 12 Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At August 31, 2012 and 2011, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Amended and Restated Credit Facility and the Old Amended and Restated Credit Facility, respectively and our securitization programs. Uses On October 20, 2011, January 25, 2012 April 19, 2012, and July 19, 2012, our Board of Directors approved payment of a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share to shareholders of record as of November 15, 2011, February 16, 2012, May 15, 2012, and August 15, 2012 respectively. The total cash dividend declared on October 20, 2011 of $17.4 million was paid on December 1, 2011, the total cash dividend declared on January 25, 2012 of $17.3 million was paid on March 1, 2012, the total cash dividend declared on April 19, 2012 of $17.3 million was paid on June 1, 2012 and the total cash dividend declared on July 19, 2012 of $17.2 million was paid on September 4, 2012. We currently expect to continue to declare and pay regular quarterly dividends of an amount similar to our past declarations. However, the declaration and payment of future dividends are discretionary and will be subject to determination by our Board of Directors each quarter following its review of our financial performance. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $100.0 million of our common shares. We repurchased 3,212,418 shares during the course of fiscal year 2012 for approximately $71.0 million. In addition, following the end of fiscal year 2012, we repurchased 1,583,815, which is the remaining amount authorized by our Board of Directors. On September 25, 2012, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $100.0 million of our common shares during the twelve month period following their authorization. As of October 22, 2012 we repurchased 3,580,104 shares for approximately $62.3 million. The remaining shares will be repurchased from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions at the Companys discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors. On December 1, 2011, we completed our acquisition of Telmar by acquiring 100% of the issued and outstanding common shares of Telmar for approximately $128.9 million in cash which was primarily funded through the Old Amended and Restated Credit Facility. Refer to Note 14 Business Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details surrounding the Telmar acquisition. Our working capital requirements and capital expenditures could continue to increase in order to support future expansions of our operations through construction of greenfield operations or acquisitions. It is possible that future expansions may be significant and may require the payment of cash. Future liquidity needs will also depend on fluctuations in levels of inventory and shipments, changes in customer order volumes and timing of expenditures for new equipment. At August 31, 2012, we had approximately $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. As our growth remains predominantly outside of the United States, a significant portion of such cash and cash equivalents are held by our foreign subsidiaries. We estimate that approximately $476.0 million of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries could not be repatriated to the United States without potential income tax consequences. For discussion of our cash management and risk management policies see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We currently anticipate that during the next 12 months, our capital expenditures will be in the range of $400.0 million to $500.0 million, principally for machinery and equipment for new business within our DMS segment, maintenance levels of machinery and equipment, information technology infrastructure upgrades and construction of new greenfield facilities. We believe that our level of resources, which include cash on hand, available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, additional proceeds available under our trade accounts receivable securitization programs and potentially available under our uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs and funds provided by operations, will be adequate to fund these capital expenditures, the payment of any declared quarterly dividends, the repurchase of common shares and our working capital requirements for the next 12 months. Our $300.0 million North American asset backed securitization program expires in October 2014 and our $200.0 million foreign asset backed securitization program expires in May 2015, and we may be unable to renew either of these. Our $250.0 million 48 Table of Contents uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale program does not have a defined termination date and either party can elect to cancel the agreement by giving prior written notification to the other party of no less than 30 days. Our $40.0 million uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale program will expire no later than June 1, 2015, though either party can elect to cancel the agreement by giving prior written notification to the other party of no less than 30 days. As the sales programs are uncommitted, we can offer no assurance that if we attempt to draw on such programs in the future that we will receive funding from the associated banks which would require us to utilize other available sources of liquidity, including our revolving credit facilities. Should we desire to consummate significant additional acquisition opportunities or undertake significant additional expansion activities, our capital needs would increase and could possibly result in our need to increase available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities or access public or private debt and equity markets. There can be no assurance, however, that we would be successful in raising additional debt or equity on terms that we would consider acceptable. See Risk Factors Our amount of debt could significantly increase in the future. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations for short and long term debt arrangements, future interest on notes payable and long term debt, future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating lease arrangements, pensions and employee benefit obligations and capital commitments as of August 31, 2012 are summarized below. We generally do not enter into non cancelable purchase orders for materials until we receive a corresponding purchase commitment from our customer. Non cancelable purchase orders do not typically extend beyond the normal lead time of several weeks at most. Purchase orders beyond this time frame are typically cancelable.

(b) Certain of our notes payable and long term debt pay interest at variable rates. In the contractual obligations table above, we have elected to apply estimated interest rates to determine the value of these future interest payments. (c) Consists of purchase commitments entered into as of August 31, 2012 for property, plant and equipment pursuant to legally enforceable and binding agreements. (d) Includes the estimated company contributions to funded pension plans during fiscal 2013 and the expected benefit payments for unfunded pension and postretirement plans from fiscal 2013 through 2022. These future payments are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet but will be recorded as incurred. (e) During the first quarter of fiscal year 2009, we committed $10.0 million to an independent private equity limited partnership which invests in companies that address resource limits in energy, water and materials (commonly referred to as the CleanTech sector). Of that amount, we have invested $6.8 million as of August 31, 2012. The remaining commitment of $3.2 million is callable over the next 12 months by the general partner. (f) At August 31, 2012, we have $7.3 million and $68.5 million recorded as a current and a long term liability, respectively, for uncertain tax positions. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of payments, or the amount by which our liability for these uncertain tax positions will increase or decrease over time, and accordingly, this liability has been excluded from the above table. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Currency Exchange Risks We transact business in various foreign countries and are, therefore, subject to risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We enter into forward contracts to economically hedge transactional exposure associated with commitments arising from trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable, intercompany transactions and fixed purchase obligations denominated in a 49 Table of Contents currency other than the functional currency of the respective operating entity. We do not intend to use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. All derivative instruments are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at their respective fair values. At August 31, 2012, except for certain foreign currency contracts with a notional amount outstanding of $199.7 million and a fair value of $1.3 million recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $1.2 million recorded in accrued expenses, we have elected not to prepare and maintain the documentation required for the transactions to qualify as accounting hedges and, therefore, changes in fair value are recorded within our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The aggregate notional amount of outstanding contracts at August 31, 2012 that do not qualify as accounting hedges was $837.3 million. The fair value of these contracts amounted to a $4.4 million asset recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a $3.0 million liability recorded to accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The forward contracts (both those that are designated as accounting hedging instruments and those that are not) will generally expire in less than three months, with five months being the maximum term of the contracts outstanding at August 31, 2012. The change in fair value related to contracts designated as accounting hedging instruments will be reflected in the revenue or expense line in which the underlying transaction occurs within our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The change in fair value related to contracts not designated as accounting hedging instruments will be reflected in cost of revenue within our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The forward contracts are denominated in Brazilian reais, British pounds, Canadian dollars, Chinese yuan renminbis, Euros, Hungarian forints, Indian rupees, Japanese yen, Malaysian ringgits, Mexican pesos, Polish zlotys, Russian rubles, Swedish krona, Tawain dollars and U.S. dollars. Based on our overall currency rate exposures as of August 31, 2012, including the derivative financial instruments intended to hedge the nonfunctional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, an immediate 10% hypothetical change of foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest Rate Risk A portion of our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our domestic investment portfolio. We do not, and do not intend to, use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. We place cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions. We protect our invested principal funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk. We mitigate these risks by generally investing in investment grade securities and by frequently positioning the portfolio to try to respond appropriately to a reduction in credit rating of any investment issuer, guarantor or depository to levels below the credit ratings dictated by our investment policy. The portfolio typically includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. At August 31, 2012, there were no significant outstanding investments. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, we entered into a series of interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $200.0 million designated as fair value hedges of a portion of our 7.750% Senior Notes. Under these interest rate swaps, we received fixed rate interest payments and paid interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a spread. The effect of these swaps was to convert fixed rate interest expense on a portion of the 7.750% Senior Notes to floating rate interest expense. Gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were recorded to interest expense and offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying 7.750% Senior Notes. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, we terminated the interest rate swaps entered into in connection with the 7.750% Senior Notes with a fair value of $12.2 million, including accrued interest of $0.6 million at August 31, 2011. The portion of the fair value that is not accrued interest is recorded as a hedge accounting adjustment to the carrying amount of the 7.750% Senior Notes and is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the 7.750% Senior Notes. At August 31, 2012, the hedge accounting adjustment recorded is $9.2 million in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We pay interest on several of our outstanding borrowings at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base interest rates. There were $8.0 million in borrowings outstanding under these facilities at August 31, 2012. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note 7 Notes Payable and Long Term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our outstanding debt obligations. The effect of an immediate hypothetical 10% change in variable interest rates would not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
