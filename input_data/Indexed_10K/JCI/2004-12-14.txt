Net income also includes a $3 million loss, net of income taxes, from discontinued operations and a $123 million loss on sale of discontinued operations, net of income taxes. (2)In 2003, Tyco consolidated variable interest entities in accordance with the transition provisions of FIN 46, as more fully described in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result, Tyco recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $75 million, net of income taxes. (3)Income from continuing operations for the year ended September 30, 2003 includes charges for the impairment of long lived assets of $815 million, charges for changes in estimates of $389 million which arose from the Companys intensified internal audits and detailed controls and operating reviews (includes net restructuring credits of $72 million and charges for the impairment of long lived assets of $10 million), other charges of $148 million, charges for the impairment of goodwill of $278 million, a net loss related to the retirement of debt of $128 million, a charge of $91 million for a retroactive incremental premium on prior period directors and officers insurance, a charge of $12 million relating to the write down of investments, other interest expense of $2 million, other interest income of $19 million, and net restructuring credits of $12 million. Net income also includes $20 million of income, net of income taxes, from discontinued operations. (4)Loss from continuing operations for the year ended September 30, 2002 includes net restructuring and other charges of $1,872 million, charges of $3,310 million for the impairment of long lived assets, goodwill impairment charges of $1,344 million, and a charge for the write off of purchased research and development 26 of $18 million. In addition, loss from continuing operations for the year ended September 30, 2002 includes a loss on investments of $271 million, a net gain on divestiture of $24 million and $30 million of income relating to the retirement of debt. Net loss also includes a $6,270 million loss, net of income taxes, from discontinued operations and a $59 million loss on sale of discontinued operations for the year ended September 30, 2002. (5)In 2001, Tyco changed its revenue recognition accounting policy to conform to the requirements of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 issued by the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result, Tyco recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $654 million, net of income taxes. Pro forma amounts for 2000 have not been presented since the effect of the change in accounting principles for that period could not be reasonably determined. In 2001, Tyco also recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $29 million, net of income taxes, in accordance with the transition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." (6)Income from continuing operations for the year ended September 30, 2001 includes a net charge of $585 million for restructuring and other charges, a charge for the write off of purchased in process research and development of $184 million and charges of $120 million for the impairment of long lived assets. Income from continuing operations for the year ended September 30, 2001 also includes a net gain on sale of businesses of $410 million, a loss on investments of $134 million, a loss of $26 million relating to the retirement of debt and a net gain on the sale of common shares of a subsidiary of $25 million. Net income includes $280 million of income, net of income taxes, from discontinued operations for the year ended September 30, 2001. (7)The increase in assets in 2001 is primarily attributable to the acquisition of The CIT Group, Inc. ("CIT") which increased assets by $11 billion, as well as a $12 billion increase in goodwill related to acquisition activity during the year. (8)Income from continuing operations for the year ended September 30, 2000 includes a net charge of $176 million for restructuring and other charges, and charges of $99 million for the impairment of long lived assets. Income from continuing operations for the year ended September 30, 2000 also includes a pretax gain of $1,760 million related to the sale by a subsidiary of its common shares. Net income also includes $46 million of income, net of income taxes, from discontinued operations for the year ended September 30, 2000. (9)Income from continuing operations includes goodwill amortization of $532 million and $338 million for the years ended September 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Effective October 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," under which goodwill is no longer amortized. (10)Tyco has paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.0125 per common share for all periods presented. On December 9, 2004, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend on our common shares from $0.0125 to $0.10 per share. The payment of dividends by Tyco in the future will depend on business conditions, Tycos financial condition and earnings and other factors. 27 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the Selected Financial Data and our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those under the headings "Risk Factors" and "Forward Looking Information." Introduction The Consolidated Financial Statements include the consolidated accounts of Tyco International Ltd., a company organized under the laws of Bermuda, and its subsidiaries (Tyco and all its subsidiaries, hereinafter collectively referred to as "we," the "Company" or "Tyco") and have been prepared in United States dollars, and in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ("GAAP"). The Company operates in the following business segments: Fire and Security designs, manufactures, installs, monitors and services electronic security and fire protection systems. Electronics designs, manufactures and distributes electrical and electronic components. Healthcare designs, manufactures and distributes medical devices and supplies, imaging agents, pharmaceuticals and adult incontinence and infant care products. Engineered Products and Services designs, manufactures, distributes and services engineered products, including industrial valves and controls, as well as steel tubular goods, and provides environmental and other industrial consulting services. Plastics and Adhesives designs, manufactures and distributes plastic products, adhesives and films. Unless otherwise indicated, references in this Annual Report to 2004, 2003 and 2002 are to Tycos fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Overview Our business strategy focuses on enhancing internal growth and operational efficiency for existing Tyco businesses. We achieve this goal primarily through new product innovation, increased market share, increasing the service and repair components of our existing businesses and continued geographic expansion. We have implemented and continue to implement additional Six Sigma initiatives across our business segments. The Company has engaged in a series of restructuring programs through which we have made our operations more efficient by exiting certain non core businesses or business lines, or streamlining general operations. The restructuring program announced in November 2003, designed to improve our cost structure primarily in Fire and Security, but also in Plastics and Adhesives and Engineered Products and Services, was substantially completed in 2004. The impact of these restructuring programs on the operations of the Company are discussed in "Operating Results" and "Segment Results." Additionally, the details related to the Companys divestiture program and the related discontinued operations are discussed in "Divestitures and Discontinued Operations." 28 References to Tyco are to the Companys continuing operations and prior year amounts have been reclassified to exclude the results of discontinued operations. During 2004, Tycos Precision Interconnect business was transferred from Healthcare to Electronics. During 2003, the Company finalized its plan to sell the Tyco Global Network ("TGN") and, as a result, reorganized its reporting structure such that the results of the TGN business held for sale are presented within Corporate and Other. Also during 2003, the Company changed its internal reporting structure such that the operations of Tycos plastics and adhesives businesses (previously reported within Healthcare and Specialty Products) now comprise the Plastics and Adhesives reportable segment. The Company has conformed its segment reporting accordingly and has reclassified comparative prior period information to reflect these changes. Operating Results The following table details net revenue and earnings for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 ($ in millions): 2004 2003 2002 Revenue from product sales $ 32,079 $ 28,844 $ 28,187 Service revenue 8,074 7,143 6,637 Net revenue $ 40,153 $ 35,987 $ 34,824 Operating income (loss) $ 5,317 $ 3,059 $ (1,472 ) Interest income 91 107 117 Interest expense (963 ) (1,148 ) (1,076 ) Other expense, net (286 ) (223 ) (217 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest 4,159 1,795 (2,648 ) Income taxes (1,140 ) (757 ) (202 ) Minority interest (14 ) (3 ) (1 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations 3,005 1,035 (2,851 ) (Loss) income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes (3 ) 20 (6,270 ) Loss on sale of discontinued operations, net of income taxes (123 ) (59 ) Income (loss) before cumulative effect of accounting change 2,879 1,055 (9,180 ) Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of income taxes (75 ) Net income (loss) $ 2,879 $ 980 $ (9,180 ) The Company made significant progress in 2004 towards meeting our strategic objectives. As described more fully in Segment Results below, over the course of 2004 we experienced solid revenue growth in Electronics, Healthcare, Engineered Products and Services, and to a lesser extent Fire and Security. We also expanded operating margins due in large part to the momentum and strong results from our operational intensity programs. In addition to the strong operating performance, favorable foreign currency exchange rates contributed positively to net revenue and operating income growth in 2004, as well as in 2003. Net revenue increased 11.6% during 2004 to $40.2 billion from $36.0 billion in 2003. Net revenue increased 3.3% during 2003 as compared to $34.8 billion in 2002. Tyco had income from continuing operations of $3,005 million in 2004, compared to $1,035 million in 2003, and a loss from continuing operations of $2,851 million in 2002. 29 The effect of changes in foreign exchange rates for 2004 compared to 2003 was an increase in net revenue and operating income of $1,685 million and $230 million, respectively. The effect of changes in foreign exchange rates for 2003 compared to 2002 was an increase in net revenue and operating income of $1,508 million and $191 million, respectively. The 2004 and 2003 impact of foreign currency was primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro against the U.S. Dollar. Income from continuing operations for 2004 included net charges totaling $755 million ($564 million after tax), consisting of the following: (i) charges for the impairment of long lived assets of $99 million, of which $34 million is attributable to machinery and equipment impairments at Fire and Security; (ii) net restructuring and other charges of $256 million, of which charges of $7 million are included in cost of sales; (iii) net losses and impairments on divestitures totaling $116 million; (iv) a loss of $284 million associated with the retirement of debt; and (v) a $5 million write down of investments. Income from continuing operations for 2003 included net charges totaling $1,832 million ($1,566 million after tax) consisting of the following: (i) charges for the impairment of long lived assets of $815 million; (ii) charges recorded for changes in estimates of $389 million which arose from the Companys intensified internal audits and detailed controls and operating reviews (includes net restructuring credits of $72 million, of which credits of $12 million are included in costs of sales, charges for the impairment of long lived assets of $10 million, charges of $243 million included in selling, general and administrative expenses, charges of $123 million included in cost of sales, a charge of $76 million relating to the write down of investments and other expense of $9 million, both of which are included in other (expenses) income, net); (iii) charges for the impairment of goodwill of $278 million; (iv) other net loss of $128 million related to the retirement of debt; (v) other charges of $148 million, of which $34 million is included in cost of sales related primarily to product warranty reserves and the dismantlement of customers ADT security systems, and $114 million is included in selling, general and administrative expenses related primarily to uncollectible accounts receivable, internal investigation fees, as well as severance and facility closures, slightly offset by a credit for changes in estimates of charges recorded in prior periods; (vi) a charge of $91 million for a retroactive, incremental premium on prior period directors and officers insurance included in selling, general and administrative expenses; (vii) a charge of $12 million relating to the write down of investments; (viii) other interest expense of $2 million; (ix) other interest income of $19 million; and (x) net restructuring credits of $12 million, of which charges of $2 million are included in cost of sales. Loss from continuing operations for 2002 included a net charge totaling $6,759 million ($6,091 million after tax), consisting of the following: (i) goodwill impairment charge of $1,344 million relating to continuing operations; (ii) charges for the impairment of long lived assets of $3,310 million primarily related to the write down of the TGN; (iii) net restructuring and other charges of $1,872 million, of which $636 million is included in cost of sales and $115 million related to a bad debt provision is included in selling, general and administrative expenses; (iv) a write off of purchased in process research and development of $18 million; (v) a loss on the write off of investments of $271 million; (vi) a gain on divestiture of $24 million; and (vii) gain from the retirement of debt of $30 million. Segment Results The segment discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in results for each segment. During 2004, divestitures impacted certain of our segments as we implemented a divestiture program in early 2004. During 2003 and 2002, acquisitions were a significant element of our growth strategy and, therefore, were a significant component of our results. See further details in "Divestitures and Discontinued Operations" and "Acquisitions" below. 30 Fire and Security The following table sets forth net revenue and operating income and margin for Fire and Security for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 ($ in millions): 2004 2003 2002 Revenue from product sales $ 5,343 $ 4,893 $ 4,733 Service revenue 6,104 5,939 5,472 Net revenue $ 11,447 $ 10,832 $ 10,205 Operating income $ 899 $ 342 $ 900 Operating margin 7.9 % 3.2 % 8.8 % Net revenue for Fire and Security increased 5.7% in 2004 as compared to 2003, including a 9.2% increase in product revenue and a 2.8% increase in service revenue. Revenue from product sales include sales and installation of security, fire protection and other systems. The increase in net revenue was primarily due to favorable currency exchange rates ($526 million) slightly offset by the effects of divestitures ($82 million). To a lesser extent, the increase in net revenue was due to stronger sales to retailers within worldwide security and higher sales volume of breathing systems and video and access control products at Tyco Safety Products. This increase was partially offset by weakness in the worldwide fire service business and Continental Europe Security. Operating income and margin increased significantly in 2004 as compared to 2003 due partially to total charges of $512 million which were recorded during 2003, discussed below. Additionally, the increase in operating income and margin was due to improvements within worldwide security related primarily to the combined impact of a stronger retailer market environment and cost reductions. Also contributing to the increase, to a lesser extent, were improvements within Continental Europe Security as a result of cost saving initiatives and a changing business model and Tyco Safety Products due primarily to increased volumes. The cost savings partly reflect the benefits of the restructuring activities described below. Operating income for 2004 also includes charges totaling $264 million, consisting primarily of restructuring ($175 million, of which $4 million is included in cost of sales), impairment ($34 million) and divestiture ($55 million) charges, substantially all of which are associated with the comprehensive cost reduction measures that began during 2003. Attrition rates for customers in our global electronic security services business decreased to an average of 15.1% on a trailing twelve month basis for 2004, as compared to 15.9% for 2003. Net revenue for Fire and Security increased 6.1% in 2003 as compared to 2002, including a 3.4% increase in product revenue and an 8.5% increase in service revenue. The increase in net revenue was due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates ($459 million) and 2002 acquisitions ($214 million calculated in the manner described below in "Acquisitions"). Acquisitions included SBC/Smith Alarm Systems, DSC Group ("DSC") and Sensormatic Electronics Corporation ("Sensormatic") in early 2002, and all other acquisitions with a purchase price of $10 million or more. In addition, an increase in net revenues due to customer contracts purchased through the ADT dealer program ($371 million) and generated through our internal sales force offset a decline in net revenue due to increased attrition rates in worldwide security. The overall increase was also partially offset by a decline in net revenue at the worldwide fire protection business due to softness in the commercial construction market. Operating income and margin decreased significantly in 2003 as compared to 2002 due to charges totaling $512 million recorded during 2003. Included within the $512 million are charges of $266 million (includes charges of $128 million primarily related to adjustments to liabilities such as workers compensation, professional fees, and environmental exposure, a charge of $98 million primarily due to adjusting allowances for doubtful accounts and slow and non moving inventory, as well 31 as a write off of subscriber systems, charges of $34 million for other adjustments primarily related to deferred commissions, and charges of $6 million related to reconciling items in the current period) recorded in connection with the Companys intensified internal audits, detailed controls and operating reviews performed during the year. Also included within the $512 million are impairment charges of $143 million primarily related to the impairment of intangible assets associated with the ADT dealer program mostly as a result of increased attrition rates (discussed below), and to the impairment of property, plant and equipment of subscriber systems and other fixed assets; net restructuring and other charges of $10 million, of which charges of $4 million are included in cost of sales and $3 million is for the write off of non current assets, related to streamlining the business; and other charges of $93 million, of which $34 million is included in cost of sales and $59 million is included in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily related to uncollectible receivables, product warranty and the dismantlement of customers ADT security systems. Included within the $143 million impairment charge and the $10 million net restructuring charge is a charge of $10 million and a credit of $2 million, respectively, also related to changes in estimates recorded during the quarter ended March 31, 2003. The decrease in operating income and margins was also due to increased depreciation and amortization expense in the security business due to growth in the subscriber asset and dealer asset base as well as the impact of the acquisitions of Sensormatic and DSC in 2002; decline in operating income in the Continental European Security business; and a weaker worldwide fire and contracting environment. Attrition rates for customers in our global electronic security services business averaged 15.9% on a trailing twelve month basis for 2003, as compared to 13.2% for 2002. This increase relates to attrition in customer accounts acquired through our worldwide dealer program, as well as internally generated commercial customer accounts in continental Europe and internally generated residential customer accounts in the United States (both of which were partly driven by increased management and control of delinquent accounts). For those account pools experiencing increased attrition, prior lifing studies were re examined. The Company concluded that existing amortization methods and asset lives continue to be appropriate given the observed actual attrition data for these pools. Operating income and margin in 2002 include a net restructuring and other charge of $95 million. The net $95 million charge includes charges of $113 million, of which inventory write downs of $19 million are reflected in cost of sales. These charges are primarily related to severance and facility exit costs associated with streamlining the business, slightly offset by a credit of $18 million relating to current and prior years restructuring charges. Also included within operating income in 2002 is a charge of $18 million for the write off of purchased in process research and development associated with the acquisitions of Sensormatic and DSC and a charge of $115 million for the impairment of property, plant and equipment resulting primarily from the termination of a software development project and, to a lesser extent, from the curtailment, and in certain markets, the termination of the ADT dealer program in certain non U.S. markets. 32 Electronics The following table sets forth net revenue and operating income and margin for Electronics for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 ($ in millions): 2004 2003 2002 Revenue from product sales $ 11,372 $ 10,052 $ 10,151 Service revenue 450 440 441 Net revenue $ 11,822 $ 10,492 $ 10,592 Operating income $ 1,749 $ 1,241 $ (1,142 ) Operating margin 14.8 % 11.8 % (10.8 )% Net revenue for Electronics increased 12.7% in 2004 as compared to 2003, including a 13.1% increase in product revenue and a 2.3% increase in service revenue. The increase in net revenue was primarily a result of growth in our existing businesses, specifically, the automotive, computer, consumer electronics, communications and industrial and commercial markets. However, we continue to experience a decrease in sales of Power Systems products in North America and in our Electrical Contracting Services, which was divested in September 2004. To a lesser extent, the increase in net revenue resulted from favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates ($560 million). The 40.9% increase in operating income and the 3.0% increase in margin in 2004 as compared to 2003 were primarily due to the revenue growth discussed above, cost saving initiatives that were executed in 2003, the positive impact of foreign currency ($90 million) and fewer charges recorded in 2004 as compared to 2003. These increases in operating income were partially offset by an 80 basis point impact of increased metal prices for copper and gold. Operating income for 2004 includes net restructuring, divestiture and impairment charges totaling $22 million. These net charges include a $52 million charge related to the divestiture of the Electrical Contracting Services business, partially offset by $33 million of net restructuring credits related to changes in estimates of severance, facility exit costs, distributor and supplier cancellation fees recorded in prior periods and the impact of the sale of assets that were impaired in prior years for amounts greater than originally anticipated. These net charges also include a $3 million charge related to the impairment of property, plant and equipment. Net revenue for Electronics decreased slightly in 2003 as compared to 2002. Net revenue at the electronic components group increased $442 million, or 4.5% due primarily to the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Net revenue for the submarine telecommunications business declined $542 million, or 79.9%, due to completion of third party undersea fiber optic system installations in 2002. Overall, the decrease in net revenue for the submarine telecommunications business more than offset the increase in total net revenue due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $524 million, and $69 million (calculated in the manner described below in "Acquisitions") due to the acquisitions of Transpower Technologies in November 2001, Communications Instruments, Inc. in January 2002, and all other acquisitions with a purchase price of $10 million or more. The increase in operating income and margin in 2003 as compared to 2002 was due to operating losses in the prior year, primarily as a result of charges totaling $1,965 million (discussed below) that were recorded in 2002. Operating income and margin for 2003 include net charges totaling $236 million. The $236 million consists primarily of charges for the impairment of goodwill of $278 million in Power Systems, Electrical Contracting Services and the Printed Circuit Group, restructuring credits of $72 million, of which $20 million is included in cost of sales, related primarily to changes in estimates of severance and facility exit costs recorded in prior years and charges for the impairment of long lived assets of $1 million. The net restructuring credit of $72 million includes $55 million of credits, which were changes in estimates recorded in connection with the Companys intensified internal audits and detailed controls and operating reviews performed during 2003. Also 33 included within the $236 million are charges of $14 million related to adjusting asset reserves, $6 million related to the adjustments to accrual balances, $9 million of reconciliation and other accounting adjustments, which were also recorded in connection with the Companys intensified internal audits and detailed controls and operating reviews performed during 2003. The operating loss in 2002 was primarily due to restructuring and other charges as well as the impairment of long lived assets and goodwill in addition to the decrease in revenue. In the electronic components business, the overall decrease in demand resulted in much lower manufacturing volumes across all business units, which increased per unit costs. In the Submarine Telecommunications business, margin was impacted significantly by a significant reduction in third party system builds. Operating loss and margin for 2002 include net restructuring and other charges of $1,115 million. The $1,115 million net charge includes charges totaling $1,141 million, of which inventory reserves of $609 million are included in cost of sales. These charges primarily relate to initiatives taken to reduce fixed costs, due to the significant downturn in the telecommunications business and certain electronics end markets, including facility closures, headcount reductions, inventory reserves and purchase commitment cancellations. These charges were slightly offset by a restructuring credit of $26 million primarily relating to a revision in estimates of current and prior years severance and facilities charges. Total inventory charges of $833 million include $609 million of inventory write downs and $212 million of supplier contract termination fees. In 2002, $20 million was originally included in the inventory written down and was recorded as a restructuring credit to cost of sales in 2003. Also included within operating loss and margins for 2002 are charges of $569 million for the impairment of long lived assets, and goodwill impairment charges of $281 million related to Tyco Submarine Telecommunications. Healthcare The following table sets forth net revenue and operating income and margin for Healthcare for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 ($ in millions): 2004 2003 2002 Revenue from product sales $ 9,040 $ 8,344 $ 7,693 Service revenue 70 76 71 Net revenue $ 9,110 $ 8,420 $ 7,764 Operating income $ 2,365 $ 2,104 $ 1,833 Operating margin 26.0 % 25.0 % 23.6 % Net revenue for Healthcare increased 8.2% in 2004 as compared to 2003. The increase in net revenue resulted primarily from growth in our existing businesses and favorable foreign currency exchange rates ($292 million). Growth in Healthcares underlying businesses was primarily a result of increased net revenue within Medical Devices & Supplies, and to a lesser extent, at Pharmaceuticals. The increase at Medical Devices & Supplies was largely driven by higher sales volume within our International division, particularly in Europe, due to benefits realized from the sales force investment, back order recovery, growth in Spain and Italy and the absence of an unfavorable $47 million contractual adjustment recorded in 2003. Also contributing to the increase in Medical Devices and Supplies were higher sales within the Medical division resulting primarily from new SharpSafety product launches and gain in market share within the wound care market. The 12.4% increase in operating income in 2004 as compared to 2003 was due primarily to the favorable margin impact of the increased sales discussed above, favorable foreign currency exchange rates and a continued focus on maximizing operating efficiencies. Operating income was adversely impacted by a $29 million increase in legal liabilities for an ongoing patent infringement suit, and a $59 million increase in research and development costs. Additionally, 2004 operating income includes 34 net restructuring, divestiture and impairment charges of $18 million, composed of: (i) restructuring charges of $13 million related to the closure of various facilities offset by a credit of $2 million due to costs being less than anticipated; (ii) a $4 million divestiture charge resulting from a loss on the sale of a business and (iii) $3 million of impairment charges related to the closure of various facilities. Net revenue for Healthcare increased 8.4% in 2003 as compared to 2002, including an 8.5% increase in product revenue and a 7.0% increase in service revenue. The increase in net revenue resulted primarily from growth in our existing businesses and favorable foreign currency exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, acquisitions, net of divestitures. Growth in our existing businesses was due to the following: increases in the Surgical division concurrent with the award of a major contract and continued organic growth within certain surgical stapling lines; increases in the Medical division resulting from the award of a significant wound care contract, coupled with the exit of a major competitor from the traditional wound care business; new product launches and higher demand in the ultrasound market; increases in Pharmaceuticals and Imaging due to higher volumes and increased market share; and, strong sales within the Respiratory division. These sales increases were partially offset by a decrease in the diaper product segment of the Retail business largely resulting from the adverse impact of the industry wide down count issues, and a decline in the International division due to lower sales in continental Europe and Latin America. The increase in net revenue also resulted from favorable changes in foreign exchange rates ($268 million) and incremental revenue generated from the acquisition of Paragon Trade Brands ("Paragon") in January 2002 ($124 million calculated in the manner described below in "Acquisitions"), slightly offset by a decline in revenue ($48 million) related to the divestiture of Surgical Dynamics, Inc. in July 2002. The 14.8% increase in operating income and increase in margin in 2003 as compared to 2002 were due primarily to favorable margin impact as a result of higher sales and favorable manufacturing variances as a result of increased production volumes, a shift to a more favorable product mix, and cost savings as a result of the closure of certain Paragon facilities, back office consolidations and our continued focus on optimizing operating expenses. Slightly offsetting the effect of those items were increased legal fees, insurance and pension expense, and higher sales and marketing expense as a result of program development aimed at supporting organic growth initiatives. Also contributing to the increase in operating income and margins were favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. During 2003, we recorded net credits totaling $2 million, including restructuring credits of $8 million due to actual costs being less than anticipated, and a credit of $7 million related to an insurance reimbursement for certain legal fees associated with product liability cases. These credits were largely offset by charges of $12 million related to asset reserves for inventory and charges of $1 million for adjustments to accrual balances related to workers compensation, which were changes in estimates recorded in connection with the Companys intensified internal audits, detailed controls and operating reviews and as a result of applying managements judgments and estimates. Operating income and margin for 2002 reflect net restructuring and other charges of $45 million. The $45 million net charge includes charges of $49 million, of which inventory write downs of $1 million are included in cost of sales. These charges primarily relate to severance associated with the consolidation of operations and facility related costs due to exiting certain business lines, and are partially offset by a credit of $4 million relating to current and prior years restructuring charges. Operating income and margin for 2002 also include a charge for the impairment of long lived assets of $2 million. 35 Engineered Products and Services The following table sets forth net revenue and operating income and margin for Engineered Products and Services for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 ($ in millions): 2004 2003 2002 Revenue from product sales $ 4,582 $ 3,824 $ 3,888 Service revenue 1,425 674 645 Net revenue $ 6,007 $ 4,498 $ 4,533 Operating income $ 620 $ 362 $ 251 Operating margin 10.3 % 8.0 % 5.5 % Net revenue for Engineered Products and Services increased $1,509 million or 33.5% in 2004 as compared to 2003, of which $739 million, or 16.4%, represents a change in how we classify certain sub contract and other costs that are paid by Infrastructure Services and re billed to their customers. These costs have historically been treated as "pass through" and were therefore not included in reported revenue and cost of revenue of Infrastructure Services. For the year ended September 30, 2004, the Company began reflecting these sub contract costs in both revenue and cost of revenue of Infrastructure Services. The Company has not adjusted revenue or cost of revenue for the years ended September 30, 2003 and 2002 as such change was not material. Further, such adjustment would have no impact on previously reported operating income, net income (loss) or cash flow. The remaining increase in net revenue resulted primarily from increased demand and higher selling prices at Electrical & Metal Products and at Tyco Fire & Building Products and favorable foreign currency exchange rates in all businesses ($298 million). Further contributing to the increase, although to a much lesser extent, were improved business conditions at Infrastructure Services due primarily to an improved construction market and continued market share growth. Sales remained flat at Flow Control as the impact of lower levels of non residential construction and industrial capital spending, primarily in North America, were offset by improved activity in other end markets and geographic regions. The 71.3% increase in operating income and the 2.3% increase in margin in 2004 as compared to 2003 were due primarily to increased net revenue discussed above, the impact of cost reduction programs initiated in prior periods and the positive impact of foreign currency ($31 million). These favorable increases were partly offset by the impact of higher raw material costs. Additionally, operating income includes net restructuring, impairment and divestiture charges of $62 million in 2004 compared to $56 million (discussed below) in 2003. Included in the $62 million charge is $53 million of restructuring and $4 million of impairment charges related to the consolidation of manufacturing, distribution and office locations and activities at Flow Control and Infrastructure Services. The remaining $5 million divestiture charge primarily relates to an impairment of goodwill related to the sale of a business. The revenue reclassification at Infrastructure Services discussed above had no impact on operating income for 2004; however, this adjustment lowered 2004 operating margin by 1.5 percentage points. Net revenue for Engineered Products and Services slightly decreased in 2003 as compared to 2002, including a 1.6% decrease in product revenue partially offset by a 4.5% increase in service revenue. Net revenue decreased year over year, as the increase in net revenue due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates ($219 million) and the effect of acquisitions ($41 million calculated in a manner described below in "Acquisitions") was more than offset by weak conditions in major markets at Flow Control and Electrical & Metal Products, most notably in non residential construction. Also contributing to the overall decrease were lower levels of capital spending and increased pricing pressure, resulting in lower selling prices. The $41 million effect from acquisitions included Century 36 Tube Corporation in October 2001, Water & Power Technologies in November 2001, Clean Air Systems in February 2002 and all other acquisitions with a purchase price of $10 million or more. The 44.2% increase in operating income and the increase in margin in 2003 compared to 2002 was due to lower than usual operating income in the prior year period as a result of recording charges of $377 million (discussed below). During 2003, we recorded charges totaling $56 million, which includes charges of $32 million related to changes in estimates recorded in connection with the Companys intensified internal audits, detailed controls and operating reviews, and as a result of applying managements judgments and estimates (including $19 million related to adjustments to workers compensation and $13 million associated with asset reserves). These charges also include charges of $8 million, of which a $6 million charge is included in cost of sales, for 2003 restructuring plans partially offset by changes in estimates due to actual costs being less than originally anticipated, charges for the impairment of long lived assets of $2 million relating to manufacturing and distribution consolidation at Flow Control and cost reduction projects, and other costs of $14 million included within selling, general and administrative expenses primarily related to the reorganization and consolidation of a manufacturing facility and certain business offices. Operating income and margin were also negatively impacted by the lower sales discussed above, competitive conditions in major markets for valves and controls, thermal controls, and electrical and metal products, and increased raw material costs, primarily steel. Operating income and margin for 2002 reflect $377 million of restructuring and other charges consisting of $48 million, of which inventory write downs of $6 million are included in cost of sales, primarily related to severance and facility exit costs associated with streamlining the business. Also included are charges of $10 million for the impairment of property, plant and equipment associated with the closure of facilities, and goodwill impairment charges of $319 million relating to Tyco Infrastructure Services. Plastics and Adhesives The following table sets forth net revenue and operating income and margin for Plastics and Adhesives for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 ($ in millions): 2004 2003 2002 Revenue from product sales $ 1,742 $ 1,731 $ 1,722 Operating income $ 69 $ 171 $ 196 Operating margin 4.0 % 9.9 % 11.4 % Net revenue increased slightly in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to an increase in price ($44 million) and volume ($4 million) in Plastics. Additionally, foreign currency had a positive impact of $9 million on net revenue, and increased volume in Ludlow Coated Products ($5 million) from its building products and flexible packaging business also contributed to the overall increase. These increases were largely offset by softness in A&E Products ($49 million), particularly in the Americas Hangers business, in Asia and in the Catering business and a slight decline in Adhesives sales volume in the Corrosion Protection business. The significant decreases in operating income and operating margin in 2004 as compared to 2003 were primarily due to impairment ($47 million) and restructuring charges ($44 million) incurred during 2004 totaling $91 million associated with the closure of various facilities. The decreases in net revenue discussed above and margin declines at A&E Products due to lower volumes and pricing pressure also contributed to the decrease in operating income and margin. Operating income and margin for 2003 includes a net credit of $1 million discussed below. Net revenue at Tyco Plastics and Adhesives increased slightly in 2003 as compared to 2002 due to the effect of favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates ($38 million) and acquisitions 37 ($21 million calculated in the manner described below in "Acquisitions"), which included LINQ Industrial Fabrics, Inc. in December 2001 and all other acquisitions with a purchase price of $10 million or more. Sales increases were achieved by higher selling prices as a result of higher raw material costs, increased sales volume of plastic sheeting and duct tape products as a result of the heightened level of security related to the potential likelihood of terrorist attacks, and a strong residential construction market for Ludlow Coated Products. These increases were more than offset by increased competition and decreases in our Corrosion Protection business, which had been negatively impacted by a slow down in the oil and gas pipeline construction markets created by uncertainty in the Middle East and Venezuela, and a decline in hanger sales due to weak demand in the retail garment industry. The significant decrease in operating income and decrease in operating margin in 2003 as compared to 2002 were primarily due to increased raw material costs (primarily polyethylene) and increased pricing competition driven by excess production capacity and an increase in lower priced imported goods. During 2003, Tyco Plastics and Adhesives recorded net credits totaling $1 million. These credits include charges of $6 million related to changes in estimates recorded in connection with the Companys intensified internal audits, detailed controls and operating reviews and as a result of applying managements judgments and estimates (including $3 million for adjustments to accrual balances, and $3 million related to asset reserves for inventory), restructuring credits of $1 million due to costs being less than anticipated and a credit of $6 million related to the settlement of a lawsuit. Operating income and margin for 2002 reflect net restructuring and other charges of $10 million, of which inventory write downs of $1 million are included in cost of sales. These charges primarily relate to severance associated with the consolidation of operations and facility related costs due to exiting certain business lines. Operating income and margins for 2002 also include a charge for the write off of long lived assets of $3 million primarily related to the impairment of long lived assets. Corporate and Other Corporate net revenue of $25 million, $14 million and $8 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, relates to the TGN business, which is classified as held for sale. Corporate expense was $385 million, $1,161 million and $3,510 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, which includes operating losses of $73 million, $760 million and $3,090 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, related to the TGN business held for sale. Corporate expense for 2004 includes net charges of $14 million, which consists of charges for the impairment of long lived assets of $8 million and net restructuring charges of $6 million primarily attributable to severance related to the relocation of the corporate headquarters. Corporate expense for 2003 includes charges totaling $824 million. Included within the $824 million is a charge of $91 million for an incremental increase in directors and officers insurance and charges of $39 million related to internal investigation fees. Also included is a charge of $20 million primarily related to severance and benefits for corporate employees and a restructuring credit of $11 million due to actual costs being less than anticipated, both of which were changes in estimates recorded in connection with the Companys intensified internal audits, detailed controls and operating reviews and as a result of applying managements judgments and estimates. Also included within the $824 million are net restructuring credits of $10 million, other net charges of $16 million included in selling, general and administrative expenses, and charges for the impairment of long lived assets of $679 million primarily related to the TGN business held for sale and, to a lesser extent, the closure and relocation of corporate offices and related severance and benefits. 38  Corporate expense in 2002 includes net restructuring, impairment and other charges of $3,914 million including $2,582 million related to the impairment of the TGN, $29 million related to the impairment of certain properties associated with the consolidation of corporate headquarters, $744 million related to goodwill impairment within the TGN business held for sale, and net restructuring and other charges of $559 million primarily related to charges within the TGN business held for sale and, to a lesser extent, the write off of investment banking fees and other deal costs associated with the terminated breakup plan and certain acquisitions that were not completed, costs incurred for the internal investigation, and severance. The significant restructuring charges recorded in 2002 were primarily related to the restructuring of the TGN business held for sale to address the significant overcapacity in the market and resulting lack of demand for new system construction. In the fourth quarter of 2002, management decided to focus the business for the foreseeable future on maintenance revenue and capacity sales on the TGN, to discontinue future additions to the TGN, and to limit construction activities to small projects that were cash flow positive with at least breakeven earnings. As a result of this strategy, management devised a plan to significantly downsize the manufacturing footprint, decrease project management staffing, reduce the research and development function and minimize staffing and expense in all other administrative areas of the business to decrease cash outflows and losses to the maximum extent possible. This plan was carefully crafted to ensure that both the technical and construction competencies of the business would be preserved in the event industry conditions improve. Results by Geographic Area Net revenue by geographic area for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 is as follows ($ in millions): 2004 2003 2002 Net revenue: United States $ 21,156 $ 19,822 $ 20,292 Other Americas 2,169 1,844 2,007 Europe 11,018 9,366 8,026 Asia Pacific 5,810 4,955 4,499 Net revenue(1) $ 40,153 $ 35,987 $ 34,824 (1)Revenue from external customers are attributed to individual countries based on the reporting entity that records the transaction. Interest Income and Expense Interest income was $91 million in 2004, as compared to $107 million and $117 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Interest expense was $963 million in 2004, as compared to $1,148 million in 2003 and $1,076 million in 2002. The decrease in interest expense in 2004 as compared to 2003 is primarily the result of a lower average debt balance in 2004 and the favorable impact of interest rate swap agreements executed during the year. The increase in interest expense in 2003 over 2002 is primarily the result of the benefit from the cancellation of certain swaps in 2002 and a decrease in capitalized interest due to the completion of the TGN, partially offset by a lower average outstanding debt balance during 2003. The weighted average rates of interest on total debt outstanding during 2004, 2003 and 2002 were 5.4%, 4.9% and 4.5%, respectively. The weighted average interest rate during 2004 increased due to the retirement of lower interest rate debt. 39 Other Expense, Net During 2004, net other expense of $286 million consisted primarily of a $284 million loss related to the repurchase of a portion of its outstanding convertible debt prior to its scheduled maturity. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding debt repurchases. During 2003, net other expense of $223 million consisted primarily of a net loss on the retirement of debt of $128 million. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding debt repurchases. Additionally, net other expense included an $87 million loss relating to the write down of various investments when it became evident that the declines in the fair value of the investments were other than temporary, predominately due to the continuing depressed economic conditions, specifically within the telecommunications industry. During 2002, net other expense of $217 million consisted primarily of a $271 million loss on various investments, mainly related to its investments in FLAG Telecom Holdings Ltd. ("FLAG") when it became evident that the declines in the fair value of FLAG and other investments were other than temporary. This loss was partially offset by a gain of $30 million related to the retirement of debt and a net gain on divestiture of $24 million (see "Divestitures and Discontinued Operations" below). Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 27.4%, 42.2% and (7.6)% for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decline in the effective rate from 2003 to 2004 is principally the result of increased profitability in operations primarily in jurisdictions with lower tax rates and a decrease in nondeductible charges. The change in the effective tax rate from 2002 to 2003 is primarily the result of a decrease in impairment and other charges which did not provide a tax benefit and a decrease in other non deductible charges. During 2004, the Company made substantial changes to its tax reporting and compliance processes, including preparation of amended U.S. federal income tax returns, hiring and training of additional tax personnel and the completion of a comprehensive review, analysis and reconciliation of its deferred tax assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2003 and September 30, 2004. The presentation of deferred tax assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2003 has been reclassified for comparability purposes as a result of this comprehensive deferred tax analysis. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $1,992 million and $1,879 million at September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109 which requires a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is "more likely than not" that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company and its subsidiaries income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. The Company is currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") for the years 1997 to 2000. In connection with such examinations, certain tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax deficiencies. The Company is reviewing the issues raised by the tax authorities and is contesting certain proposed tax deficiencies. Amounts related to these tax deficiencies and other tax contingencies that management has assessed as probable and estimable have been recorded through the income tax provision. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. 40 These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by these taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as payment is not expected within one year. In connection with the IRS audits for the years 1997 2000, the Company prepared proposed amendments to these prior period U.S. federal income tax returns resulting in a reduction in the taxable income previously reported. The IRS is currently reviewing the proposed amendments. The Company has not recorded the impact of the proposed amendments, pending the completion of the IRS review. The proposed amendments, if accepted, will result in receipt of refunds or credits and a corresponding reduction to the deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company may prepare proposed amendments to prior period U.S. federal income tax returns for additional periods. The proposed amendments are not expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Except for earnings that are currently distributed, no additional provision has been made for U.S. or non U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or the Company has concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of distribution of such earnings. A liability could arise if amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries. Divestitures and Discontinued Operations During 2003, we conducted a comprehensive review of our core businesses, and as a result, implemented a divestiture program in early 2004. This strategy is intended to sharpen our focus on core businesses, simplify operations and improve cost structure. This divestiture program is designed to increase the focus on our core operations by exiting certain operations that do not meet our criteria for strategic fit or financial returns. In November 2003, we estimated that the potential proceeds excluding the proceeds from the sale of the TGN could be at least $400 million once the program is completed. Cumulative proceeds through the date of this filing are approximately $412 million. As part of this program, we planned to sell the TGN, our undersea fiber optic telecommunications network. The market for the TGN is challenged by significant overcapacity and severe pricing pressure and the industry is in need of consolidation. However, we plan to retain ownership of the telecommunications systems supply business which provides maintenance and undersea cable construction. In November 2004, we agreed to sell the TGN to one of Indias telephone and internet service providers for $130 million. As discussed in Note 3, the entire value of the TGN has been written off. The sale is subject to governmental approval in the United States, India and other countries. 2004 Activity During 2004, the Company recorded net losses and impairments of divestitures of $116 million in continuing operations in connection with the divestiture or write down to fair value of certain held for sale businesses. In addition, the Company also recorded losses on the sale of discontinued operations of $132 million ($123 million after tax) to write the carrying value of such assets down to their estimated fair value. 41 In connection with the divestiture program announced in November 2003, the Company divested twenty one and liquidated four non core businesses across all business segments, except Plastics and Adhesives and primarily within Fire and Security, for aggregate proceeds of $252 million in cash, of which $16 million of the proceeds are currently held in escrow. Total assets and total liabilities of the divested businesses were $445 million and $115 million, respectively. Total assets include cash retained by the businesses sold of $13 million. Subsequent to September 30, 2004, the Company divested an additional seven non core businesses realizing aggregate proceeds of approximately $160 million. Net revenue and net loss for 2004 through the date of disposition were $460 million and $43 million, respectively, for divested companies that did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations. Net revenue and net income for the year ended September 30, 2003 were $587 million and $24 million, respectively, for divested companies that did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations. Net revenue of 2004 discontinued operations for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $889 million, $815 million and $766 million, respectively. Pretax (loss) income of these discontinued operations for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $(135) million, $7 million and $19 million, respectively. The following table presents balance sheet information for discontinued operations and other businesses held for sale at September 30, 2004 and 2003 ($ in millions): 2004 2003 Accounts receivable, net $ 209 $ 160 Inventories 95 61 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 95 27 Property, plant and equipment, net 96 121 Other assets 120 120 Total assets $ 615 $ 489 Accounts payable $ 155 $ 119 Accrued and other current liabilities 243 73 Other liabilities 125 Total liabilities $ 523 $ 192 2003 Activity During 2003, Tyco recorded income from discontinued operations of $20 million for a restitution payment made by Frank E. Walsh Jr., a former director (see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 2002 Activity During 2002, the Company sold certain of its businesses for net proceeds of $139 million in cash that consisted primarily of businesses within Healthcare and Fire and Security. In connection with these dispositions, the Company recorded a net gain of $24 million, which is included in other expense, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. On July 8, 2002, the Company divested Tyco Capital (CIT Group Inc.) through the sale of 100% of the common shares of CIT Group Inc. ("CIT"), its principal operating subsidiary, in an initial public offering ("IPO"). Accordingly, the results of Tyco Capital are presented as discontinued operations. Operating results from the discontinued operations of Tyco Capital from October 1, 2001 through July 8, 2002 were $3.3 billion of finance income, $6.0 billion of pre tax loss and $6.3 billion of net loss. The net loss includes a goodwill impairment charge of $6,638 million. 42 During the quarter ended March 31, 2002, Tyco experienced disruptions to its business surrounding its announced break up plan, a downgrade in its credit ratings, and a significant decline in its market capitalization. During this same time period, CIT also experienced credit downgrades and a disruption to its historical funding base. Further, market based information developed in connection with the Companys preliminary consideration of the proposed IPO of CIT indicated that CITs book value exceeded its estimated fair value as of March 31, 2002. As a result, the Company performed a SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," first step impairment analysis as of March 31, 2002 and concluded that an impairment charge was warranted at that time. Managements objective in performing the first step goodwill impairment analysis was to obtain relevant market based data to calculate the estimated fair value of CIT as of March 31, 2002 based on its projected earnings and market factors expected to be used by market participants in ascribing value to CIT in the planned separation of CIT from Tyco. Management obtained relevant market data from financial advisors regarding the range of price to earnings multiples and market condition discounts applicable to CIT as of March 31, 2002 and applied these market data to CITs projected annual earnings as of March 31, 2002 to calculate an estimated fair value and any resulting goodwill impairment. The estimated fair value was compared to the corresponding carrying value of CIT at March 31, 2002. As a result, the Company recorded a $4,513 million impairment charge as of March 31, 2002, which is included in discontinued operations. A second step goodwill impairment analysis is required whenever a reporting units book value exceeds estimated fair value. This analysis required the Company to estimate the fair value of the reporting units individual assets and liabilities to complete the analysis of goodwill as of March 31, 2002. The Company completed this second step analysis for CIT during the quarter ended June 30, 2002 and, as a result, recorded an additional goodwill impairment charge of $132 million. During the June 30, 2002 quarter, CIT experienced further credit downgrades and the business environment and other factors continued to negatively impact the likely proceeds of the IPO. As a result, the Company performed another first step and second step analysis as of June 30, 2002 in a manner consistent with the March 2002 process described above. Each of these analyses was based upon updated market data at June 30, 2002 and through the period immediately following the IPO, including the IPO proceeds. These analyses resulted in a goodwill impairment of $1,867 million. Tyco also recorded an additional impairment charge of $126 million in order to write down its investment in CIT to fair value for a total CIT goodwill impairment of $2,125 million. This write down was based upon net IPO proceeds of approximately $4.4 billion, after deducting estimated out of pocket expenses, and is included in the $6,283 million loss from discontinued operations. During the fourth quarter of 2002, Tyco recorded a loss on the sale of Tyco Capital of $59 million. Acquisitions Prior to 2003, acquisitions were a significant element of our growth strategy. When we acquired a business, we began to integrate the acquired company with our existing operations immediately, and, consequently, we were generally unable to separately identify the post acquisition financial results of acquired companies. The revenue growth or decline attributable to such acquisitions, which are included in segment discussions for 2003 and 2002, were estimates calculated by assuming the acquisitions were made at the beginning of the relevant year by adding back pre acquisition revenue of the acquired companies for both periods. These calculations included all acquisitions with a purchase price of $10 million or more and did not include acquisitions with a purchase price of less than $10 million, due to the relative size of these smaller acquisitions compared to Tycos operating results and the large number of acquisitions during 2003 and 2002. These smaller acquisitions represent approximately 6% of the total purchase price for all acquisitions during 2003 and 2002. Since these estimates are based on pre acquisition revenue, they are not necessarily indicative of post acquisition results. This calculation is similar to the method used in calculating the acquisition related pro forma 43 results of operations in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements pursuant to SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations." Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change As discussed in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has three synthetic lease programs utilized, to some extent, by all of the Companys segments to finance capital expenditures for manufacturing machinery and equipment and for ships used by Tyco Submarine Telecommunications. During 2003, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation ("FIN") No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," (revised December 2003 as FIN No. 46R) and, accordingly, restructured one of the synthetic leases to meet the requirements of FIN 46 for off balance sheet accounting. The Company reclassified the remaining two leases as capital leases and, consequently, recorded a $75 million after tax loss ($115 million pretax) cumulative effect adjustment. In addition, total debt increased by $498 million at the time of consolidation, July 1, 2003. In 2003 in conjunction with adopting FIN 46, the Company also evaluated other investments and concluded that four joint ventures that were previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting within Tyco Infrastructure Services, in which we own a minority interest, met the consolidation criteria set forth in FIN 46. Accordingly, these ventures were consolidated onto the Companys balance sheet effective July 1, 2003. The assets and liabilities of these joint ventures included on the Companys balance sheet at that time were $112 million and $96 million, respectively. Subsequently, these four joint ventures were deconsolidated as of March 31, 2004 with the adoption of FIN 46R. The assets and liabilities of these joint ventures included in the Companys balance sheet at September 30, 2003 were $96 million and $69 million, respectively. Change in Fiscal Year On November 4, 2004, the Board of Directors approved the change in our fiscal year end from a calendar fiscal year ending September 30 to a "52 53 week" year ending on the Friday nearest September 30, such that each quarterly period will be 13 weeks in length. Once every seven years, starting in 2011, the fourth quarter reporting period will be 14 weeks. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries have consistently closed their books up to one month prior to our fiscal period end. We plan to report results for these subsidiaries using the same period as the reported results of the consolidated Company. While the expected December holiday related slow down in certain customer sales is expected to shift from the second fiscal quarter to the first fiscal quarter, the impact of this change is not expected to be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This change is also consistent with our ongoing efforts to enhance controls and improve the transparency of its reporting, as this change better aligns our external reporting with our internal operational processes. This change will be effective for our first fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2004. The results for the transition period related to this change will be reported as an adjustment within Shareholders Equity. No transition report is required for these changes.  Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ("GAAP") requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. 44 Depreciation and Amortization Method for Security Monitoring Systems Tyco generally considers its electronic security assets in three asset pools: internally generated residential systems, internally generated commercial systems and customer accounts acquired through the ADT dealer program. The determination of the depreciable lives of subscriber systems included in property, plant and equipment, and the amortizable lives of customer contracts and related customer relationships included in intangible assets, are primarily based on historical attrition rates, third party lifing studies and the useful life of the underlying tangible asset. The realizable value and remaining useful lives of these assets could be impacted by changes in customer attrition rates. If the attrition rates were to rise, Tyco may be required to accelerate the depreciation and amortization. With respect to Tycos depreciation policy for security monitoring systems installed in residential and commercial customer premises, the costs of these systems are combined in separate pools for internally generated residential and internally generated commercial account customers (collectively "subscriber systems"), and generally depreciated over ten to fourteen years. Tyco concluded that for residential and commercial account pools the straight line method of depreciation over a ten to fourteen year period continues to be appropriate given the observed actual attrition data for these pools. Tyco purchases residential security monitoring contracts from an external network of independent dealers who operate under the ADT dealer program. The purchase price of these customer contracts is recorded as an intangible asset (i.e., contracts and related customer relationships). Intangible assets arising from the ADT dealer program are amortized in pools determined by the month of contract acquisition on an accelerated basis over the period and pattern of economic benefit that is expected to be obtained from the customer relationship. Tyco believes that the accelerated method that presently best achieves the matching objective described above is the double declining balance method based on a ten year life for the first eight years of the estimated life of the customer relationships converting to the straight line method of amortization for the remaining four years of the estimated relationship period. Actual attrition data is regularly reviewed in order to assess the continued applicability of the accelerated method of amortization described above. Attrition rates for customers in our Global Electronic Security Services business were 15.1%, 15.9% and 13.2% on a trailing 12 month basis as of September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Goodwill In performing the annual goodwill assessment, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. Since managements judgment is involved in performing goodwill valuation analyses, there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated or understated. We elected to make July 1 the annual impairment assessment date for all reporting units. Goodwill valuations have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. This approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors and income tax rates. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in a goodwill impairment in future periods. Disruptions to our business such as end market conditions and protracted economic weakness, unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units, the divestiture of a significant component of a reporting unit and market capitalization declines may result in our having to perform a SFAS No. 142 first step valuation analysis for some or all of our reporting units prior to the required annual assessment. These types of events and the resulting analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future. 45 During 2004, the Company recorded goodwill impairments of $60 million of which $48 million related to divested businesses and $12 million related to businesses classified as held for sale, respectively. The Company also recorded goodwill impairments of $278 million and $1,344 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Revenue Recognition Contract sales for the installation of fire protection systems, large security intruder systems, undersea cable systems and other construction related projects are recorded primarily on the percentage of completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon contracted revenue and related estimated cost to completion. The risk of this methodology is its dependence upon estimates of costs to completion, which are subject to the uncertainties inherent in long term contracts. Revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they first become determinable. If estimates are inaccurate, there is risk that our revenue and profits for the period may be overstated or understated. Income Taxes In determining income (loss) for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. Deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and international pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income. Any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. If a change in a valuation allowance occurs, which was established in connection with an acquisition, such adjustment may impact goodwill rather than the income tax provision. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If the tax 46 liabilities relate to tax uncertainties existing at the date of the acquisition of a business, the adjustment of such tax liabilities will result in an adjustment to the goodwill recorded at the date of acquisition. Long Lived Assets Assets held and used by the Company, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of evaluating the recoverability of long lived assets to be held and used, a recoverability test is performed based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk. Impairments to long lived assets to be disposed of are recorded based upon the fair value of the applicable assets. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of long lived assets, there is a risk that the carrying value of our long lived assets may be overstated or understated.  Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes the sources of our cash flow from operating activities and the use of a portion of that cash in our operations for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 ($ in millions): 2004 2003 2002 Cash flows from operating activities: Operating income (loss) $ 5,317 $ 3,059 $ (1,472 ) Non cash restructuring and other (credits) charges, net (30 ) (46 ) 796 Impairment of long lived assets 99 825 3,310 Non cash losses (gains) and impairments on divestitures, net 111 (24 ) Goodwill impairment 278 1,344 Write off of purchased in process research and development 18 Depreciation and amortization(1) 2,176 2,183 2,073 Deferred income taxes 172 357 (578 ) Provision for losses on accounts receivable and inventory 321 580 499 Debt and refinancing cost amortization 55 116 194 Other, net(2) 81 100 112 Net (increase) decrease in working capital 23 (226 ) 368 Decrease in sale of accounts receivable (929 ) (119 ) (56 ) Interest income 91 107 117 Interest expense (963 ) (1,148 ) (1,076 ) Income tax expense (1,140 ) (757 ) (202 ) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 5,384 $ 5,309 $ 5,423 Other cash flow items: Capital expenditures, net(3) $ (1,015 ) $ (1,274 ) $ (2,823 ) Dividends paid (100 ) (101 ) (100 ) Decrease in sale of accounts receivable 929 119 56 Acquisition of customer accounts (ADT dealer program) (254 ) (597 ) (1,138 ) Cash paid for purchase accounting and holdback/earn out liabilities (107 ) (272 ) (625 ) (1)This amount is the sum of depreciation ($1,478 million, $1,459 million and $1,454 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively) and amortization of intangible assets ($698 million, $724 million and $619 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively). (2)This amount includes the add back of net losses on the retirement of debt of $284 million and $128 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, and income from the retirement of debt of $33 million in 2002. (3)This includes net proceeds of $141 million, $124 million and $166 million received for the sale/disposition of property, plant and equipment in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. It also includes proceeds of $30 million received in sale leaseback transactions in 2002. 47 The following table shows cash flow from operating activities and other cash flow items by segment for the year ended September 30, 2004 ($ in millions): Fire and Security Electronics Healthcare Engineered Products and Services Plastics and Adhesives Corporate and Other Total Cash flows from operating activities: Operating income (loss) $ 899 $ 1,749 $ 2,365 $ 620 $ 69 $ (385 ) $ 5,317 Non cash restructuring and other charges (credits), net 4 (33 ) (1 ) 4 (4 ) (30 ) Impairment of long lived assets 34 3 3 4 47 8 99 Non cash losses and impairments on divestitures, net 51 51 4 5 111 Depreciation 589 472 249 114 50 4 1,478 Intangible assets amortization 543 68 78 2 7 698 Depreciation and amortization 1,132 540 327 116 57 4 2,176 Deferred income taxes 172 172 Provision for losses on accounts receivable and inventory 150 54 63 50 4 321 Debt and refinancing cost amortization 55 55 Net decrease (increase) in working capital and other(1) (154 ) (197 ) (157 ) (45 ) 8 649 104 Decrease in sale of accounts receivable(2) (97 ) (20 ) (112 ) (700 ) (929 ) Interest income 91 91 Interest expense (963 ) (963 ) Income tax expense (1,140 ) (1,140 ) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 2,019 $ 2,147 $ 2,493 $ 749 $ 189 $ (2,213 ) $ 5,384 Other cash flow items: Capital expenditures, net (335 ) (370 ) (239 ) (45 ) (28 ) 2 $ (1,015 ) Dividends paid (100 ) (100 ) Decrease in sale of accounts receivable programs 97 20 112 700 929 Acquisition of customer accounts (ADT dealer program) (254 ) (254 ) Cash paid for purchase accounting and holdback/earn out liabilities (31 ) (48 ) (12 ) (14 ) (2 ) (107 ) (1)This amount includes the add back of $284 million related to a loss on the retirement of debt. (2)Fire and Security and Electronics include $91 million and $21 million, respectively, related to Corporate programs. The net change in total working capital, net of the effects of divestitures and acquisitions, was a cash decrease of $906 million in 2004, including cash paid for restructuring and other charges of $266 million. The components of this change are set forth in detail in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The significant changes in working capital included a $225 million increase in inventories and a $153 million increase in accounts receivable, offset by an increase of $406 million in income taxes payable. Also, during 2004 we significantly decreased our participation in our sale of accounts receivable programs resulting in an additional $929 million increase in accounts receivable. We strive to maximize our cash flow by minimizing the working capital employed in our businesses. During 2004, 2003 and 2002 we paid out $266 million, $503 million and $518 million, respectively, in cash related to restructuring activities. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our restructuring activities. 48 During 2004, 2003 and 2002, Tyco paid $254 million, $597 million and $1,138 million of cash, respectively, to acquire 0.3 million, 0.6 million and 1.4 million customer contracts for electronic security services through the ADT dealer program. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, we paid $107 million, $272 million and $625 million, respectively, in cash for purchase accounting and holdback/earn out liabilities. Holdback liabilities represent a portion of the purchase price that is withheld from the seller pending finalization of the acquisition balance sheet. Certain acquisitions have provisions which require Tyco to make additional "earn out" payments to the sellers if the acquired company achieves certain milestones subsequent to its acquisition by Tyco. These earn out payments are tied to certain performance measures, such as revenue, gross margin or earnings growth. At September 30, 2004, the acquisition liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets were $123 million, of which $29 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and $94 million is included in other liabilities. In addition, holdback/earn out liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets were $167 million, of which $59 million are included in accrued and other current liabilities and $108 million are included in other liabilities. As previously discussed, during 2003, we conducted a comprehensive review of Tycos core businesses, and as a result, implemented a divestiture program in early 2004. In November 2003 we estimated that the potential proceeds, excluding the proceeds from the sale of the TGN, could be at least $400 million once the program is completed. Cumulative proceeds through the date of this filing are approximately $412 million. As part of this program, we planned to sell the TGN, our undersea fiber optic telecommunications network. In November 2004, we agreed to sell the TGN to one of Indias telephone and internet service providers for $130 million. As discussed in Note 3, the entire value of the TGN has been written off. The sale is subject to governmental approval in the United States, India and other countries. We continue to fund capital expenditures to improve the cost structure of our businesses, to invest in new processes and technology, and to maintain high quality production standards. During 2003 and 2002, we spent $113 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, on construction of the TGN. Construction of the TGN was completed during 2003. Consequently, the level of capital expenditures in Electronics decreased in 2004. The level of capital expenditures in the other segments is not expected to exceed depreciation in 2005 and is expected to increase slightly relative to the level of spending in 2004. The provision for income taxes relating to continuing operations in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for 2004 was $1,140 million, and the amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during the year was $550 million. The difference is due to timing differences, as well as net operating loss carryforward and carryback utilization. Capitalization Shareholders equity was $30.3 billion at September 30, 2004, compared to $26.4 billion at September 30, 2003. This increase was due primarily to net income of $2.9 billion and foreign currency translation of $704 million. At September 30, 2004, total debt decreased $4.2 billion to $16.7 billion, as compared to $21.0 billion at September 30, 2003. Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization (total debt and shareholders equity) was 36% at September 30, 2004 and 44% at September 30, 2003. The decrease in debt resulted principally from the repayments of debt detailed below partially offset by the issuance of $1.0 billion 6.0% notes due 2013 by Tyco International Group S.A. ("TIGSA") in November 2003. Our cash balance increased to $4,467 million at September 30, 2004, as compared to $4,186 million at September 30, 2003. 49 In November 2003, TIGSA issued $1.0 billion 6.0% notes due 2013 in a private placement offering. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Tyco. The net proceeds of approximately $988 million were used to repay a portion of the $2.0 billion outstanding under the 5 year revolving credit facility due 2006. These notes were subsequently exchanged for registered notes with substantially identical terms in an exchange offer that expired on May 3, 2004. In November 2003, holders of principal amount at maturity of $3,197 million of zero coupon convertible debentures due 2020 notified Tyco that they had exercised their option to require Tyco to repurchase their debentures at a price of $775.66 per $1,000 principal at maturity, representing the accreted value of the debentures on that date. On November 18, 2003, Tyco purchased these debentures for cash of $2,480 million. In December 2003, TIGSA entered into a $1.0 billion 364 day revolving bank credit facility, which includes a one year term out option, and a $1.5 billion 3 year revolving bank credit facility. These facilities have a variable interest rate based on LIBOR. The margin over LIBOR payable by TIGSA can vary based on changes in its credit rating. These new facilities replaced the $1.5 billion undrawn 364 day revolving credit facility, which had been due to expire in January 2004, and the $2.0 billion drawn 5 year revolving credit facility, which had been due to expire in February 2006. As of September 30, 2004, there were no outstanding borrowings under either facility. The $1.0 billion 364 day revolving credit facility expires on December 20, 2004, and we expect that the facility will be replaced by a $1.0 billion 5 year revolving credit facility prior to its expiration. The $1.5 billion 3 year revolving credit facility expires on December 22, 2006. In June 2004, the Company purchased $303 million of its 8.2% notes due 2008 for cash of $341 million, which resulted in a $38 million loss, including unamortized debt issuance costs, on the retirement of debt. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company repurchased $517 million of its outstanding 2.75% convertible senior debentures with a 2008 put option. The total purchase price paid was $750 million and the repurchase resulted in a $241 million loss on the retirement of debt, including the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs. Our bank credit agreements contain a number of financial covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and minimum levels of net worth, and other covenants that limit our ability to pledge assets and to make substantial payments in connection with our capital shares. At September 30, 2004, we had three synthetic lease facilities, of which one has since expired on December 10, 2004, with other covenants, including interest coverage and leverage ratios. Our outstanding indentures contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges, subsidiary debt and sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants is presently considered restrictive to our operations. We are currently in compliance with all of our debt covenants. In 2004, we made voluntary contributions to our pension plans totaling approximately $575 million. The above transactions support Tycos previously discussed strategy to strengthen its balance sheet by using a portion of its excess cash to reduce debt. We plan to use available cash to continue to fund internal growth and cost reduction opportunities within our businesses. Additionally, we believe that our cash flow generation capability will allow us to continue to strengthen the balance sheet and return capital to shareholders. While debt reduction remains our focus in the near term, we may consider an appropriate acquisition should the opportunity arise. On December 9, 2004, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend on our common shares from $0.0125 to $0.10 per share. 50 The following table details the trend of our debt ratings: At September 30, 2004 At September 30, 2003 Short Term Long Term Short Term Long Term Moodys Prime 3 Baa3 Not prime Ba2 Standard & Poors A2 BBB A3 BBB Fitch F2 BBB+ B BB During 2004, Fitch upgraded our rating on the senior unsecured debt of the Company, as well as on the unconditionally guaranteed debt of TIGSA, to BBB+ from BB, and raised our commercial paper rating to F2 from B. Standard and Poors upgraded our corporate credit and senior unsecured ratings to BBB from BBB and our short term corporate credit and commercial paper ratings to A2 from A3. Moodys upgraded our long term rating to Baa3 from Ba2, as well as our short term rating to Prime 3 from Not Prime. The security ratings set forth above are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 51   Commitments and Contingencies Contractual Obligations A summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for debt, minimum lease payment obligations under non cancelable operating leases and other obligations at September 30, 2004 is as follows ($ in millions): 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Debt(1) $ 2,116 $ 2,026 $ 764 $ 2,608 $ 1,648 $ 7,571 Operating leases(2) 658 529 377 273 212 862 Purchase obligations(3) 192 10 2 1 1 12 Total contractual cash obligations(4) $ 2,966 $ 2,565 $ 1,143 $ 2,882 $ 1,861 $ 8,445 (1)Includes capital lease obligations and excludes interest. (2)Includes obligations under an off balance sheet leasing arrangement under which a subsidiary of the Company has the option to buy five cable laying sea vessels (see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). (3)Purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of good and services. (4)Minimum pension funding requirements are not included as such amounts have not been determined for all periods presented. The minimum required contributions to our pension plans are expected to be approximately $194 million in 2005. At September 30, 2004, the Company had outstanding letters of credit and letters of guarantee in the amount of $1.6 billion. At September 30, 2004, TIGSA had unsecured credit facilities of $1.0 billion due December 20, 2004, and $1.5 billion due December 22, 2006, both of which were undrawn and available (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). We expect that the existing $1.0 billion facility will be replaced by a $1.0 billion 5 year revolving credit facility prior to its expiration. In addition, certain of the Companys operating subsidiaries have overdraft and similar types of facilities, which total $434 million, of which $326 million was undrawn and available at September 30, 2004. These facilities expire at various dates through the year 2013, most of which are renewable and are established primarily within our international operations. At September 30, 2004, the Company had a contingent liability of $80 million related to the 2001 acquisition of Com Net by Electronics. This represents the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of Com Net only after the construction and installation of a communications system for the State of Florida is finished and the State has approved the system based on the guidelines set forth in the contract. No provision has been made in the Consolidated Financial Statements, as the outcome of this contingency cannot be reasonably determined. In June 2004, TIGSA entered into a $500 million 3 year unsecured letter of credit facility. The facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit, supported by a related line of credit facility. TIGSA may only borrow under the line of credit agreement to reimburse the bank for obligations with respect to letters of credit issued under this facility. The covenants under this facility are substantially similar to TIGSAs bank credit facilities entered into during December 2003 and the indenture related to TIGSAs 6% notes due 2013 issued in November 2003. TIGSA would pay interest on any outstanding borrowings at a variable interest rate, based on the banks base rate or the Eurodollar rate, as defined. Upon the occurrence of certain credit events, the interest rate on the outstanding borrowings becomes fixed. The issuance of letters of credit under this facility during 2004 enabled the 52 Company to release approximately $480 million of restricted cash and investments. As of September 30, 2004, there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility. In the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Legal Matters Class Actions For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos securities class actions, shareholder derivative litigation, ERISA litigation and investigation, and litigation against our former senior management, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings. We are generally obligated to indemnify our directors and officers and our former directors and officers who are named as defendants in some or all of these matters to the extent required by Bermuda law. In addition, our insurance carriers may decline coverage, or our coverage may be insufficient to cover our expenses and liability, in some or all of these matters. We are unable at this time to estimate what our ultimate liability in these matters may be, and it is possible that we will be required to pay judgments or settlements and incur expenses, in excess of any insurance coverage, in aggregate amounts that would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or probable losses, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters. Investigation For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to governmental investigations related to Tyco see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Subpoenas and Document Requests From Governmental Entities. We cannot predict when these investigations will be completed, nor can we predict what the results of these investigations may be. It is possible that we will be required to pay material fines, consent to injunctions on future conduct, lose the ability to conduct business with government instrumentalities (which in turn could negatively impact our business with non governmental customers) or suffer other penalties, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. It is not possible to estimate the amount of loss, or range of possible loss, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters. Intellectual Property Litigation For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos intellectual property litigation, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Intellectual Property Litigation. Environmental Matters For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos environmental matters, see Item 1. Business Environmental Matters. Asbestos Matters Like many other companies, Tyco and some of our subsidiaries are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials. Consistent with the national trend of increased asbestos related litigation, we have observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits in the past several years. The majority of these cases have been filed against subsidiaries in Healthcare and Engineered Products and Services. A limited number of the cases allege premises liability, based on claims that individuals were exposed to asbestos while on a subsidiarys property. A majority of the cases involve product liability claims, based principally on allegations of past distribution 53 of heat resistant industrial products incorporating asbestos or the past distribution of industrial valves that incorporated asbestos containing gaskets or packing. Each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants. Tycos involvement in asbestos cases has been limited because our subsidiaries did not mine or produce asbestos. Furthermore, in our experience, a large percentage of these claims were never substantiated and have been dismissed by the courts. We will continue to vigorously defend these lawsuits and we have not suffered an adverse verdict in a trial court proceeding related to asbestos claims. When appropriate, we settle claims. However, the total amount paid to date to settle and defend all asbestos claims has been immaterial. As of September 30, 2004, there were approximately 14,500 asbestos liability cases pending against us and our subsidiaries. We believe that we and our subsidiaries have substantial indemnification protection and insurance coverage, subject to applicable deductibles, with respect to asbestos claims. These indemnitors and the relevant carriers typically have been honoring their duty to defend and indemnify. We believe that we have valid defenses to these claims and intend to continue to defend them vigorously. Additionally, based on our historical experience in asbestos litigation and an analysis of our current cases, we believe that we have adequate amounts recorded for potential settlements and adverse judgments in asbestos related litigation. While it is not possible at this time to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome of these asbestos related proceedings, we believe that the final outcome of all known and anticipated future claims, after taking into account our substantial indemnification rights and insurance coverage, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Income Tax Matters Tyco and its subsidiaries income tax returns are periodically examined by various regulatory tax authorities. In connection with such examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax deficiencies. We are reviewing the issues raised by the tax authorities and are contesting certain of the proposed tax deficiencies. Amounts related to these tax deficiencies and other tax contingencies that management has assessed as probable and estimable have been recorded through the income tax provision. We cannot provide assurance that the ultimate resolution of these tax deficiencies and contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "AJCA"), signed into law in October 2004, replaces an export incentive with a deduction from domestic manufacturing income. It is not expected that the AJCA will have a material impact on the Companys income tax provision. The AJCA also allows the Company to repatriate up to $500 million of permanently reinvested foreign earnings in 2005 or 2006 at an effective tax rate of 5.25%. The Company is currently reviewing whether to take advantage of this new provision of the AJCA. Other Matters The Company is a defendant in a number of other pending legal proceedings incidental to present and former operations, acquisitions and dispositions. The Company does not expect the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As new internal controls and procedures are implemented, any reported allegations or violations of our guide to ethical conduct are investigated and appropriate disciplinary and remedial measures are taken. An allegation was brought to our attention that during the period from 1999 through 2003 certain improper payments were made by a non U.S. subsidiary of Tyco with 2004 revenue of 54 $40 million. With the assistance of outside counsel, we conducted an internal investigation into these allegations and whether certain payments were correctly recorded in the books and records of the subsidiary. We have taken remedial steps and have reported the results of our investigation to the Department of Justice and the SEC and are cooperating with their inquiry. We do not believe this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Backlog At September 30, 2004, we had a backlog of unfilled orders of $13.2 billion, compared to a backlog of $11.3 billion at September 30, 2003. We expect that approximately 80% of our backlog at September 30, 2004 will be filled during 2005. Backlog by reportable industry segment at September 30 is as follows ($ in millions): 2004 2003(1) Fire and Security $ 6,726 $ 6,782 Engineered Products and Services 3,469 2,025 Electronics 2,454 2,025 Healthcare 280 297 Plastics and Adhesives 118 96 Corporate and Other 120 76 $ 13,167 $ 11,301 (1)During the first quarter of 2004, our Precision Interconnect business was transferred from Healthcare to Electronics. In addition, the results of the TGN business held for sale are presented within Corporate and Other. The Company has conformed its segment reporting accordingly and has reclassified comparative prior period information to reflect these changes. Within Fire and Security, backlog decreased primarily as a result of the sale of Sonitrol by ADT Security in the second quarter of 2004. Backlog for Fire and Security includes recurring revenue in force, which represents twelve months fees for monitoring and maintenance services under contract in the security business. The amount of recurring revenue in force at September 30, 2004 and September 30, 2003 was $3,559 million and $3,607 million, respectively. Within Engineered Products and Services, backlog increased primarily as a result of a $1.4 billion adjustment related to a change in how we classify sub contract costs that are paid by Infrastructure Services and re billed to their customers. These costs have historically been treated as "pass through" and were therefore not previously included in reported revenue and cost of revenue of Infrastructure Services. During 2004, the Company began reflecting these subcontract costs in both revenue and cost of revenue of Infrastructure Services. Within Electronics, backlog increased primarily due to stronger orders resulting from an overall improvement in business conditions across the vast majority of its end markets. Backlog in Healthcare and Plastics and Adhesives represents unfilled orders, which, in the nature of the businesses, are normally shipped shortly after purchase orders are received. We do not view backlog in Healthcare and Plastics and Adhesives to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity. 55   Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale of Accounts Receivable Tyco has several programs under which it may sell participating interests in accounts receivable to investors who, in turn, purchase and receive ownership and security interests in those receivables. As collections reduce accounts receivable included in the pool, the Company sells new receivables. The Company has the risk of credit loss on the receivables and, accordingly, the full amount of the reserve has been retained on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The proceeds from the sales were used to repay short term and long term borrowings and for working capital and other corporate purposes and are reported as operating cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The sale proceeds are less than the face amount of accounts receivable sold by an amount that approximates the cost that would be incurred if commercial paper were issued backed by these accounts receivable. The discount from the face amount is accounted for as a loss on the sale of receivables and has been included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Such discount aggregated $18 million, $29 million, and $17 million, or 3.1%, 3.5%, and 2.7% of the weighted average balance of the receivables outstanding, during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company retains collection and administrative responsibilities for the participating interests in the defined pool. During 2004, the Company reduced outstanding balances under its accounts receivable programs by $929 million, of which $812 million relates to three of its corporate accounts receivable programs. At September 30, 2004 and 2003, the availability under corporate programs was $625 million and $1,025 million, respectively. Subsequent to September 30, 2004, the Company further reduced the availability under these programs to $550 million. At September 30, 2004 and 2003, the amounts utilized under these programs was zero and $803 million, respectively. The remaining reduction related to certain of our international businesses selling fewer accounts receivable as a short term financing mechanism. These transactions qualify as true sales. The aggregate amount outstanding under these arrangements was $99 million and $202 million at September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Variable Interest Entities The Company has programs under which it sells machinery and equipment to investors who, in turn, purchase and receive ownership and security interests in those assets. As such, the Company may have certain investments in those affiliated companies whereby it provides varying degrees of financial support and where the investors are entitled to a share in the results of those entities but do not consolidate these entities. While these entities may be substantive operating companies, they have been evaluated for potential consolidation under FIN 46. As previously discussed, during 2003 the Company restructured one of the synthetic leases to meet the requirements of FIN 46 for off balance sheet accounting. In 2003 in conjunction with adopting FIN 46, the Company also evaluated other investments and concluded that four joint ventures that were previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting within Tyco Infrastructure Services, in which we own a minority interest, met the consolidation criteria set forth in FIN 46. Accordingly, these ventures were consolidated onto the Companys balance sheet effective July 1, 2003, and were subsequently deconsolidated as of March 31, 2004 upon the adoption of FIN 46R. The assets and liabilities of these joint ventures included in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2003 were $96 million and $69 million, respectively. Guarantees Certain of the Companys business segments have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from 2005 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance and the potential exposure for 56 nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In disposing of assets or businesses, the Company often provides representations, warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. The Company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, we have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows. The Company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item I. Business Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. The Company has guaranteed the fair value of certain vessels not to exceed $235 million, and as of September 30, 2004 expects the obligation to be $54 million, which is recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, based on its estimate of fair value of the vessels (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources Contractual Obligations" above). As a result of exiting certain facilities as part of restructuring and acquisition plans, or otherwise, the Company continues to lease certain properties which it has vacated but has sub let to third parties. In the event the third parties vacate the premises, the Company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements. The Company believes that the financial risk of default by sub lessors is not material, individually and in the aggregate, to the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company generally records estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. For further information on estimated product warranty, see Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 57  Accounting Pronouncements In November 2003, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03 1, "The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments." EITF 03 1 provides guidance on determining other than temporary impairments and its application to marketable equity securities and debt securities accounted for under SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") EITF Issue 03 1 1 which delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in the EITF 03 1 pending finalization of the draft FSP EITF Issue 03 1 a, "Implementation Guidance for the Application of Paragraph 16 of EITF 03 1." The disclosure requirements of EITF 03 1 remain in effect. The Company adopted the disclosure requirement of EITF 03 1 as of September 30, 2004. The adoption of the recognition and measurement provisions of EITF 03 1 are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46 (revised December 2003 as FIN 46R). FIN 46R further explains how to identify Variable Interest Entities ("VIE") and how to determine when a business enterprise should include the assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interest and results of VIE in its financial statements. The Company adopted FIN 46R as of March 31, 2004. As a result, the joint ventures that were previously consolidated under FIN 46 were deconsolidated effective March 31, 2004. See Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the impact of FIN 46R. In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to SFAS No. 132, "Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits," to improve financial statement disclosure for defined benefit plans. This statement requires additional disclosures about the assets (including plan assets by category), obligations and cash flows of defined pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans. It also requires reporting of various elements of pension and other postretirement benefit costs on a quarterly basis. Generally, the disclosure requirements are effective for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2003; however, information about foreign plans is effective for fiscal years ending after June 15, 2004. Tyco adopted the revised SFAS No. 132 during the quarter ended March 31, 2004. See Note 19 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of retirement plans. In December 2003, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 104, "Revenue Recognition," which supercedes SAB 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements." SAB 104s primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in SAB 101 related to multiple element revenue arrangements, superceded as a result of the issuance of EITF 00 21, "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables." The issuance of SAB 104 reflects the concepts contained in EITF 00 21. The other revenue recognition concepts contained in SAB 101 remain largely unchanged. The issuance of SAB 104 did not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In May 2004, the FASB issued FSP No. 106 2, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003." FSP No. 106 2 provides guidance on the accounting for the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the "Act") on postretirement health care plans that provide prescription drug benefits. FSP No. 106 2 also requires certain disclosures regarding the effect of the federal subsidy provided by the Act. FSP No. 106 2 is effective for Tyco in the fourth quarter of 2004. The adoption of FSP No. 106 2 did not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In September 2004, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 04 8 "The Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted Earnings per Share." This EITF requires that contingently convertible debt securities with a market price trigger be included in diluted earnings per share, regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met. EITF 04 8 is effective for all 58 periods ending after December 15, 2004 and requires retroactive restatement of previously reported earnings per share. Any contingently convertible instrument that is settled in cash before December 31, 2004 would not be reflected in the retroactive restatement. The adoption of this EITF is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4." SFAS No. 151 amends Accounting Research Bulletin ("ARB") No. 43, Chapter 4, to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials (spoilage) should be recognized as current period charges. In addition, SFAS No. 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No. 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company is currently assessing the impact that SFAS No. 151 will have on the results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 59   Risk Factors You should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our publicly traded securities. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as competition, technological obsolescence, labor relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations and our liquidity. Risks Relating to Actions of Tycos Former Senior Corporate Management Pending litigation could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition. As a result of actions taken by our former senior corporate management, Tyco, some members of our former senior corporate management, former members of our Board of Directors and our current Chief Executive Officer are named defendants in a number of purported class actions alleging violations of the disclosure provisions of the federal securities laws. Tyco, certain of our current and former employees, some members of our former senior corporate management and some former members of our Board of Directors also are named as defendants in several ERISA class actions. In addition, Tyco and some members of our former senior corporate management are subject to an SEC inquiry, and some members of our former senior corporate management are named as defendants in criminal cases being prosecuted by the District Attorney of New York County. The findings and outcomes of the prosecutions and the SEC civil action may affect the course of the purported securities class actions and ERISA class actions pending against Tyco. We are generally obligated to indemnify our directors and officers and our former directors and officers who are also named as defendants in some or all of these matters to the extent required by Bermuda law. In addition, our insurance carriers may decline coverage, or our coverage may be insufficient to cover our expenses and liability, in some or all of these matters. We are unable at this time to estimate what our ultimate liability in these matters may be, and it is possible that we will be required to pay judgments or settlements and incur expenses, in excess of any insurance coverage, in aggregate amounts that would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or probable losses, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters. Continued scrutiny resulting from ongoing governmental investigations may have an adverse effect on our business. We and others have received subpoenas and requests from the SECs Division of Enforcement, the District Attorney of New York County, the Department of Labor and others seeking the production of voluminous documents in connection with various investigations into our governance, management, operations, accounting and related controls. Certain current and former employees in Fire and Security received subpoenas from the SECs Division of Enforcement seeking testimony related to past accounting practices regarding the ADT dealer connect fees. As previously reported in our periodic filings, these practices have been discontinued. The Department of Labor is investigating Tyco and the administrators of certain of our benefit plans. We cannot predict when these investigations will be completed, nor can we predict what the results of these investigations may be. It is possible that we will be required to pay material fines, consent to injunctions on future conduct, lose the ability to conduct business with government instrumentalities (which in turn could negatively impact our business with non governmental customers) or suffer other penalties, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot provide assurance that the effects and results of these or other investigations will not be material and adverse to our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 60 Examinations and audits by tax authorities, including the IRS, could result in additional tax payments for prior periods. Tyco and our subsidiaries income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. Tyco is currently under audit by the IRS for the years 1997 to 2000. In connection with such examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax deficiencies. We are reviewing the issues raised by the tax authorities and are contesting certain of the proposed tax deficiencies. Amounts related to these tax deficiencies and other tax contingencies that management has assessed as probable and estimable have been accrued through the income tax provision. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. In connection with the IRS audits for the years 1997 2000, the Company prepared proposed adjustments to these prior period U.S. federal income tax returns. The proposed amendments are currently being reviewed by the IRS and if accepted will result in receipt of refunds or credits and a corresponding reduction to our deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company may prepare proposed amendments to prior period U.S. federal income tax returns for additional periods. Ongoing SEC inquiries may require us to further amend or restate our public disclosures. We are subject to inquiries by the SECs Division of Enforcement. We cannot provide assurance that the resolution of the Division of Enforcements inquiries will not necessitate further amendments or restatements to our previously filed periodic reports or lead to some enforcement proceedings against Tyco. The SECs Division of Enforcement has not completed its review of prior managements actions and our accounting, including the matters covered by the Companys Current Report on Form 8 K filed on December 30, 2002. Further instances of breakdowns in our internal controls and procedures could have an adverse effect on us. Management has determined that, in the past, Tyco in general suffered from: poor documentation; inadequate policies and procedures to prevent the misconduct of senior corporate executives; inadequate procedures for proper corporate authorizations; inadequate approval procedures and documentation; a lack of oversight by senior management at the corporate level; a pattern of using aggressive accounting that, even when in accordance with GAAP, was intended to increase reported earnings above what they would have been if more conservative accounting had been employed; pressure on, and inducements to, segment and unit managers to increase current earnings, including decisions as to what accounting treatment to employ; and a lack of a stated and demonstrable commitment by former senior corporate management to set high standards of ethics, integrity, accounting, and corporate governance. 61 While we have implemented new procedures, we cannot provide assurance that we will not discover that there have been further instances of breakdowns in our internal controls and procedures. Material adverse legal judgments, fines, penalties or settlements could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness. We estimate that our available cash and our cash flow from operations will be adequate to fund our operations and service our debt for the forseeable future. In making this estimate, we have not assumed the need to make any material payments in connection with our pending litigation or investigations. Any material adverse legal judgments, fines, penalties or settlements arising from our pending investigations and litigation could require additional funding. If such developments require us to obtain additional funding, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain the additional funding that we need on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Such an outcome could have important consequences to you. For example, it could: require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes, including debt reduction or dividend payments; increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate; restrict our ability to introduce new technologies or exploit business opportunities; make it more difficult for us to satisfy our payment obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness; and increase the difficulty and or cost to us of refinancing our indebtedness. Additional negative publicity may adversely affect our business. As a result of actions taken by our former senior corporate management, Tyco was the subject of continuing negative publicity focusing on these actions. This negative publicity contributed to significant declines in the prices of our publicly traded securities in 2002 and brought increased regulatory scrutiny upon us. Additional negative publicity related to former senior corporate managements actions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows and the market price of our publicly traded securities. Our senior corporate management team is required to devote significant attention to matters arising from actions of prior management. We replaced our senior corporate executives with a new team during 2002 through 2004, and all of the former members of our Board of Directors determined not to stand for reelection in March 2003. A new Board of Directors was elected at our annual general meeting of shareholders in March 2003. We cannot provide assurance that this major restructuring of our Board of Directors and senior management team, and the accompanying distractions related to matters arising from the actions of prior management will not adversely affect our results of operations. 62 Risks Relating to Our Businesses Cyclical industry and economic conditions have affected and may continue to adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our operating results in some of our segments are affected adversely by the general cyclical pattern of the industries in which they operate. For example, demand for the products and services of Fire and Security and Engineered Products and Services is significantly affected by levels of commercial construction and consumer and business discretionary spending. Also, the electronic components business within Electronics is heavily dependent on the end markets it serves and therefore can be affected by the demand and capital investment patterns of these markets, which could impact the margins in this business. This cyclical impact can be amplified because some of our businesses purchase products from other of our businesses. For example, Fire and Security purchases certain products sold by Engineered Products and Services. Therefore, a drop in demand for our fire prevention products due to lower new residential or office construction or other factors can cause a drop in demand for certain of our products sold by Engineered Products and Services. Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities, litigation and violations. We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing, among other things: the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials; emissions or discharges of substances into the environment; and the health and safety of our employees. There can be no assurances that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with environmental and health and safety laws. If we violate these laws, we could be fined, criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. For example, on August 17, 2004, one of our subsidiaries in Electronics was sentenced for Clean Water Act violations at three of its manufacturing plants in Connecticut, pursuant to which it paid a $6 million fine and an additional $4 million to fund environmental projects designed to improve the environment for local residents. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings Environmental Litigation. Certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances and costs to restore natural resources. In addition to cleanup costs resulting from environmental laws, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances used, stored or disposed of by us or contained in our products. We have been notified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, certain foreign and state environmental agencies, and some third parties that conditions at a number of sites where we and others disposed of hazardous substances require cleanup and other possible remedial action and may require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the cost of cleanup of those sites and or for natural resource damages. We also have a number of projects underway at several of our current and former manufacturing facilities in order to comply with environmental laws or otherwise remediate environmental contamination. These projects relate to a variety of activities, including: radioactive materials decontamination and decommissioning; solvent, metal and other hazardous substance contamination cleanup; and oil spill equipment upgrades and replacement. 63 These projects, some of which are voluntary and some of which are required under applicable law, involve both remediation expenses and capital improvements. In addition, we remain responsible for certain environmental issues at manufacturing locations previously sold by us. The ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods. We have concluded that it is probable that we would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately $167 million to $443 million. We concluded that the best estimate within this range is approximately $265 million, of which $42 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and $223 million is included in other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2004. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. While we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with such laws, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations or that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past, present or future business activities. We may be required to recognize additional impairment charges. Pursuant to GAAP, we are required to periodically assess our goodwill, intangibles and other long lived assets to determine if they are impaired. Disruptions to our business, end market conditions and protracted economic weakness, unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units, divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in additional charges to goodwill and other asset impairments. Future impairment charges could substantially affect our reported earnings in the period of such charge. In addition, such charges would reduce our consolidated net worth and our shareholders equity, increasing our debt to total capitalization ratio. Such reduction in consolidated net worth and increase in debt as a percentage of total capitalization could result in a default under our credit facilities. Foreign currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results. We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Our net revenue derived from sales in non U.S. markets for 2004, 2003 and 2002 were 47.4%, 45.0% and 41.8%, respectively, and we expect revenue from non U.S. markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenue. Therefore, when the U.S. Dollar strengthens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries where we sell our products, such as the Euro, our U.S. Dollar reported revenue and income will decrease. changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and may, in some instances, have a significant effect on our results of operations. Our financial statements reflect recalculations of items denominated in non U.S. currencies to U.S. Dollars, our functional currency. We are a large buyer of steel and resin in the United States. We are also a large buyer of other commodities, including copper, brass, gold, paper, pulp and cotton. Volatility in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services. We may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers and this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. 64 We monitor these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program. In some cases, we purchase hedges or enter into contracts to insulate our results of operations from these fluctuations. Nevertheless, changes in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates may have a material adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to a significant amount of litigation, including litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights, litigation alleging anti competitive behavior and product liability litigation. In certain circumstances, patent infringement and anti trust laws permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages. In addition, our Healthcare business is subject to regulation and potential litigation. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our managements attention, and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, that could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our Healthcare business is subject to extensive regulation by the government and failure to comply with those regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulates the approval, manufacturing and sale and marketing of many of our healthcare products. Failure to comply with current Good Manufacturing Practices and other applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead to temporary manufacturing shutdowns, product shortages or delays in product manufacturing. Efficacy or safety concerns, an increase in trends of adverse events in the marketplace, and or manufacturing quality issues with respect to our products could lead to product recalls, withdrawals or declining sales. Our ADT business has generally experienced higher rates of customer attrition, which may reduce our future revenue and has caused us to change the useful life of accounts, increasing our depreciation and amortization expense. Attrition rates for customers in our global electronic security services business were 15.1%, 15.9% and 13.2% on a trailing 12 month basis as of September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. If attrition rates show an upward trend, ADTs recurring revenue and results of operations will be adversely affected. Tyco amortizes the costs of ADTs contracts and related customer relationships purchased through the ADT dealer program using a double declining balance method based on a ten year life for the first eight years of the estimated life of the customer relationships, converting to the straight line method of amortization to completely amortize the asset pool by the end of the twelfth year. Internally generated residential and commercial account pools are amortized using a straight line method over ten to fourteen years. If the attrition rates were to rise for these account pools, then Tyco may be required to accelerate the amortization of the costs related to these pools, which could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our reputation and our ability to do business may be impaired by reckless or corrupt behavior by any of our employees or agents or those of our subsidiaries. Tyco and its subsidiaries operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, including, but not limited to, Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. Tycos policy mandates strict compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as amended, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials. Nonetheless, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or 65 criminal acts committed by our employees that would violate the U.S. and or foreign laws governing payments to government officials. These actions could result in criminal or civil penalties, including substantial monetary fines, against us or our subsidiaries and could damage our reputation and, therefore, our ability to do business. An allegation was brought to our attention that during the period from 1999 through 2003 certain improper payments were made by a non U.S. subsidiary of Tyco with 2004 revenue of $40 million. With the assistance of outside counsel, we conducted an internal investigation into these allegations and whether certain payments were correctly recorded in the books and records of the subsidiary. We have taken remedial steps and have reported the results of our investigation to the Department of Justice and the SEC and are cooperating with their inquiry. Covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us. Our bank credit agreements contain financial covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and minimum levels of net worth, and other covenants that limit our ability to pledge assets and to make substantial payments in connection with our capital shares. We have synthetic lease facilities with other covenants, including interest coverage and leverage ratios. Our outstanding indentures contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges, subsidiary debt and sale/leaseback transactions. Although we believe none of these covenants are presently restrictive to our operations, our ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot provide assurance that we will meet those tests. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreements or indentures. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our credit facilities or indentures, the lenders or trustees could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If the lenders or trustees accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our credit facilities and our other indebtedness. Acceleration of any obligation under any of our material debt instruments will permit the holders of our other material debt to accelerate their obligations. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources. Downgrades of our debt ratings would adversely affect us. Certain downgrades by Moodys and S&P would permit the providers of our receivables facilities, to the extent that our receivables facilities are utilized, to cease further purchases under the facilities and would increase the interest cost of our credit facility borrowings. Downgrades may also increase our cost of capital and make it more difficult for us to obtain new financing. Risks Relating to Our Jurisdiction of Incorporation Legislation and negative publicity regarding Bermuda companies could increase our tax burden and affect our operating results. Legislation Relating to Government Contracts We continue to assess the potential impact of various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals that would deny government contracts to U.S. companies that move their corporate location abroad. The legislative proposals could cover the 1997 acquisition of Tyco International Ltd., a Massachusetts corporation, by ADT Limited (a public company that had been located in Bermuda since the 1980s with origins dating back to the United Kingdom since the early 1900s), as a result of which ADT changed its name to Tyco International Ltd. and became the parent to the Tyco group. 66 In 2003, the State of California adopted legislation intended to limit the eligibility of certain Bermuda and other foreign chartered companies to participate in certain state contracts. To date Tyco companies have requested waivers which have been granted or are still pending with only one request having been denied. However, there is no reliable process for how that waiver authority will be exercised and how the provision for such waivers will affect Tycos business. In addition, the U.S. federal government and various other states and municipalities have proposed or may propose legislation that would deny government contracts to U.S. companies that move their corporate location abroad. We are unable to predict with any level of certainty the likelihood or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law, the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments, or the impact such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business. Tycos revenues related to direct sales to the U.S. federal government and the State of California accounted for less than 2.0% and 0.1%, respectively, of our total net revenues for 2004. We are unable to predict, however, whether the final form of the proposed legislation discussed above would also affect Tycos indirect sales to the U.S. federal or state governments or the willingness of Tycos non governmental customers to do business with us. As a result of these uncertainties, we are unable to assess the potential impact on us of any proposed legislation in this area and can provide no assurance that the impact will not be materially adverse. Tax Legislation The U.S. Congress has in the past considered legislation affecting the tax treatment of U.S. companies that have undertaken certain types of expatriation transactions. Recently, the U.S. Congress enacted such legislation, which did not, however, retroactively apply to the 1997 acquisition of Tyco International Ltd. by ADT Limited. We expect various tax proposals to be introduced in the U.S. Congress in the future and cannot provide assurance that these proposals would not have adverse effects on Tyco if enacted. Such adverse effects could include substantially reducing the tax benefits of our corporate structure, materially increasing our tax burden or otherwise adversely affecting our business. Negative Publicity There is continuing negative publicity regarding, and criticism of, U.S. companies use of, or relocation to, offshore jurisdictions, including Bermuda. As a Bermuda company, this negative publicity could harm our reputation and impair our ability to generate new business if companies or government agencies decline to do business with us as a result of the negative public image of Bermuda companies or the possibility of our customers receiving negative media attention from doing business with a Bermuda company. Bermuda law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of our securities. We are organized under the laws of Bermuda. It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the United States against us in Bermuda based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some doubt as to whether the courts of Bermuda would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the United States and Bermuda do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any 67 U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Bermuda. As a Bermuda company, Tyco is governed by the Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda, which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to United States corporations and shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to interested director and officer transactions, shareholder lawsuits and indemnification. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of a Bermuda company are generally owed to the company only. Shareholders of Bermuda companies do not generally have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may only exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company in limited circumstances. Under Bermuda law, a company may also agree to indemnify directors and officers for any personal liability, not involving fraud or dishonesty, incurred in relation to the company. Thus, holders of Tyco securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are subject to market risk associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. In order to manage the volatility relating to our more significant market risks, we enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts, cross currency swaps, foreign currency options, and interest rate swaps. We do not anticipate any material changes in our primary market risk exposures in 2005. We utilize established risk management policies and procedures in executing derivative financial instrument transactions. We do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Derivative financial instruments related to interest rate sensitivity of debt obligations, intercompany cross border transactions and anticipated non functional currency cash flows, are used with the goal of mitigating a significant portion of these exposures when it is cost effective to do so. Counterparties to derivative financial instruments are limited to financial institutions with at least an A/A2 long term debt rating.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the Selected Financial Data and our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those under the headings "Risk Factors" and "Forward Looking Information." Introduction The Consolidated Financial Statements include the consolidated accounts of Tyco International Ltd., a company organized under the laws of Bermuda, and its subsidiaries (Tyco and all its subsidiaries, hereinafter collectively referred to as "we," the "Company" or "Tyco") and have been prepared in United States dollars, and in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ("GAAP"). The Company operates in the following business segments: Fire and Security designs, manufactures, installs, monitors and services electronic security and fire protection systems. Electronics designs, manufactures and distributes electrical and electronic components. Healthcare designs, manufactures and distributes medical devices and supplies, imaging agents, pharmaceuticals and adult incontinence and infant care products. Engineered Products and Services designs, manufactures, distributes and services engineered products, including industrial valves and controls, as well as steel tubular goods, and provides environmental and other industrial consulting services. Plastics and Adhesives designs, manufactures and distributes plastic products, adhesives and films. Unless otherwise indicated, references in this Annual Report to 2004, 2003 and 2002 are to Tycos fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Overview Our business strategy focuses on enhancing internal growth and operational efficiency for existing Tyco businesses. We achieve this goal primarily through new product innovation, increased market share, increasing the service and repair components of our existing businesses and continued geographic expansion. We have implemented and continue to implement additional Six Sigma initiatives across our business segments. The Company has engaged in a series of restructuring programs through which we have made our operations more efficient by exiting certain non core businesses or business lines, or streamlining general operations. The restructuring program announced in November 2003, designed to improve our cost structure primarily in Fire and Security, but also in Plastics and Adhesives and Engineered Products and Services, was substantially completed in 2004. The impact of these restructuring programs on the operations of the Company are discussed in "Operating Results" and "Segment Results." Additionally, the details related to the Companys divestiture program and the related discontinued operations are discussed in "Divestitures and Discontinued Operations." 28 References to Tyco are to the Companys continuing operations and prior year amounts have been reclassified to exclude the results of discontinued operations. During 2004, Tycos Precision Interconnect business was transferred from Healthcare to Electronics. During 2003, the Company finalized its plan to sell the Tyco Global Network ("TGN") and, as a result, reorganized its reporting structure such that the results of the TGN business held for sale are presented within Corporate and Other. Also during 2003, the Company changed its internal reporting structure such that the operations of Tycos plastics and adhesives businesses (previously reported within Healthcare and Specialty Products) now comprise the Plastics and Adhesives reportable segment. The Company has conformed its segment reporting accordingly and has reclassified comparative prior period information to reflect these changes. Operating Results The following table details net revenue and earnings for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 ($ in millions): 2004 2003 2002 Revenue from product sales $ 32,079 $ 28,844 $ 28,187 Service revenue 8,074 7,143 6,637 Net revenue $ 40,153 $ 35,987 $ 34,824 Operating income (loss) $ 5,317 $ 3,059 $ (1,472 ) Interest income 91 107 117 Interest expense (963 ) (1,148 ) (1,076 ) Other expense, net (286 ) (223 ) (217 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest 4,159 1,795 (2,648 ) Income taxes (1,140 ) (757 ) (202 ) Minority interest (14 ) (3 ) (1 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations 3,005 1,035 (2,851 ) (Loss) income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes (3 ) 20 (6,270 ) Loss on sale of discontinued operations, net of income taxes (123 ) (59 ) Income (loss) before cumulative effect of accounting change 2,879 1,055 (9,180 ) Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of income taxes (75 ) Net income (loss) $ 2,879 $ 980 $ (9,180 ) The Company made significant progress in 2004 towards meeting our strategic objectives. As described more fully in Segment Results below, over the course of 2004 we experienced solid revenue growth in Electronics, Healthcare, Engineered Products and Services, and to a lesser extent Fire and Security. We also expanded operating margins due in large part to the momentum and strong results from our operational intensity programs. In addition to the strong operating performance, favorable foreign currency exchange rates contributed positively to net revenue and operating income growth in 2004, as well as in 2003. Net revenue increased 11.6% during 2004 to $40.2 billion from $36.0 billion in 2003. Net revenue increased 3.3% during 2003 as compared to $34.8 billion in 2002. Tyco had income from continuing operations of $3,005 million in 2004, compared to $1,035 million in 2003, and a loss from continuing operations of $2,851 million in 2002. 29 The effect of changes in foreign exchange rates for 2004 compared to 2003 was an increase in net revenue and operating income of $1,685 million and $230 million, respectively. The effect of changes in foreign exchange rates for 2003 compared to 2002 was an increase in net revenue and operating income of $1,508 million and $191 million, respectively. The 2004 and 2003 impact of foreign currency was primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro against the U.S. Dollar. Income from continuing operations for 2004 included net charges totaling $755 million ($564 million after tax), consisting of the following: (i) charges for the impairment of long lived assets of $99 million, of which $34 million is attributable to machinery and equipment impairments at Fire and Security; (ii) net restructuring and other charges of $256 million, of which charges of $7 million are included in cost of sales; (iii) net losses and impairments on divestitures totaling $116 million; (iv) a loss of $284 million associated with the retirement of debt; and (v) a $5 million write down of investments. Income from continuing operations for 2003 included net charges totaling $1,832 million ($1,566 million after tax) consisting of the following: (i) charges for the impairment of long lived assets of $815 million; (ii) charges recorded for changes in estimates of $389 million which arose from the Companys intensified internal audits and detailed controls and operating reviews (includes net restructuring credits of $72 million, of which credits of $12 million are included in costs of sales, charges for the impairment of long lived assets of $10 million, charges of $243 million included in selling, general and administrative expenses, charges of $123 million included in cost of sales, a charge of $76 million relating to the write down of investments and other expense of $9 million, both of which are included in other (expenses) income, net); (iii) charges for the impairment of goodwill of $278 million; (iv) other net loss of $128 million related to the retirement of debt; (v) other charges of $148 million, of which $34 million is included in cost of sales related primarily to product warranty reserves and the dismantlement of customers ADT security systems, and $114 million is included in selling, general and administrative expenses related primarily to uncollectible accounts receivable, internal investigation fees, as well as severance and facility closures, slightly offset by a credit for changes in estimates of charges recorded in prior periods; (vi) a charge of $91 million for a retroactive, incremental premium on prior period directors and officers insurance included in selling, general and administrative expenses; (vii) a charge of $12 million relating to the write down of investments; (viii) other interest expense of $2 million; (ix) other interest income of $19 million; and (x) net restructuring credits of $12 million, of which charges of $2 million are included in cost of sales. Loss from continuing operations for 2002 included a net charge totaling $6,759 million ($6,091 million after tax), consisting of the following: (i) goodwill impairment charge of $1,344 million relating to continuing operations; (ii) charges for the impairment of long lived assets of $3,310 million primarily related to the write down of the TGN; (iii) net restructuring and other charges of $1,872 million, of which $636 million is included in cost of sales and $115 million related to a bad debt provision is included in selling, general and administrative expenses; (iv) a write off of purchased in process research and development of $18 million; (v) a loss on the write off of investments of $271 million; (vi) a gain on divestiture of $24 million; and (vii) gain from the retirement of debt of $30 million. Segment Results The segment discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in results for each segment. During 2004, divestitures impacted certain of our segments as we implemented a divestiture program in early 2004. During 2003 and 2002, acquisitions were a significant element of our growth strategy and, therefore, were a significant component of our results. See further details in "Divestitures and Discontinued Operations" and "Acquisitions" below. 30 Fire and Security The following table sets forth net revenue and operating income and margin for Fire and Security for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 ($ in millions): 2004 2003 2002 Revenue from product sales $ 5,343 $ 4,893 $ 4,733 Service revenue 6,104 5,939 5,472 Net revenue $ 11,447 $ 10,832 $ 10,205 Operating income $ 899 $ 342 $ 900 Operating margin 7.9 % 3.2 % 8.8 % Net revenue for Fire and Security increased 5.7% in 2004 as compared to 2003, including a 9.2% increase in product revenue and a 2.8% increase in service revenue. Revenue from product sales include sales and installation of security, fire protection and other systems. The increase in net revenue was primarily due to favorable currency exchange rates ($526 million) slightly offset by the effects of divestitures ($82 million). To a lesser extent, the increase in net revenue was due to stronger sales to retailers within worldwide security and higher sales volume of breathing systems and video and access control products at Tyco Safety Products. This increase was partially offset by weakness in the worldwide fire service business and Continental Europe Security. Operating income and margin increased significantly in 2004 as compared to 2003 due partially to total charges of $512 million which were recorded during 2003, discussed below. Additionally, the increase in operating income and margin was due to improvements within worldwide security related primarily to the combined impact of a stronger retailer market environment and cost reductions. Also contributing to the increase, to a lesser extent, were improvements within Continental Europe Security as a result of cost saving initiatives and a changing business model and Tyco Safety Products due primarily to increased volumes. The cost savings partly reflect the benefits of the restructuring activities described below. Operating income for 2004 also includes charges totaling $264 million, consisting primarily of restructuring ($175 million, of which $4 million is included in cost of sales), impairment ($34 million) and divestiture ($55 million) charges, substantially all of which are associated with the comprehensive cost reduction measures that began during 2003. Attrition rates for customers in our global electronic security services business decreased to an average of 15.1% on a trailing twelve month basis for 2004, as compared to 15.9% for 2003. Net revenue for Fire and Security increased 6.1% in 2003 as compared to 2002, including a 3.4% increase in product revenue and an 8.5% increase in service revenue. The increase in net revenue was due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates ($459 million) and 2002 acquisitions ($214 million calculated in the manner described below in "Acquisitions"). Acquisitions included SBC/Smith Alarm Systems, DSC Group ("DSC") and Sensormatic Electronics Corporation ("Sensormatic") in early 2002, and all other acquisitions with a purchase price of $10 million or more. In addition, an increase in net revenues due to customer contracts purchased through the ADT dealer program ($371 million) and generated through our internal sales force offset a decline in net revenue due to increased attrition rates in worldwide security. The overall increase was also partially offset by a decline in net revenue at the worldwide fire protection business due to softness in the commercial construction market. Operating income and margin decreased significantly in 2003 as compared to 2002 due to charges totaling $512 million recorded during 2003. Included within the $512 million are charges of $266 million (includes charges of $128 million primarily related to adjustments to liabilities such as workers compensation, professional fees, and environmental exposure, a charge of $98 million primarily due to adjusting allowances for doubtful accounts and slow and non moving inventory, as well 31 as a write off of subscriber systems, charges of $34 million for other adjustments primarily related to deferred commissions, and charges of $6 million related to reconciling items in the current period) recorded in connection with the Companys intensified internal audits, detailed controls and operating reviews performed during the year. Also included within the $512 million are impairment charges of $143 million primarily related to the impairment of intangible assets associated with the ADT dealer program mostly as a result of increased attrition rates (discussed below), and to the impairment of property, plant and equipment of subscriber systems and other fixed assets; net restructuring and other charges of $10 million, of which charges of $4 million are included in cost of sales and $3 million is for the write off of non current assets, related to streamlining the business; and other charges of $93 million, of which $34 million is included in cost of sales and $59 million is included in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily related to uncollectible receivables, product warranty and the dismantlement of customers ADT security systems. Included within the $143 million impairment charge and the $10 million net restructuring charge is a charge of $10 million and a credit of $2 million, respectively, also related to changes in estimates recorded during the quarter ended March 31, 2003. The decrease in operating income and margins was also due to increased depreciation and amortization expense in the security business due to growth in the subscriber asset and dealer asset base as well as the impact of the acquisitions of Sensormatic and DSC in 2002; decline in operating income in the Continental European Security business; and a weaker worldwide fire and contracting environment. Attrition rates for customers in our global electronic security services business averaged 15.9% on a trailing twelve month basis for 2003, as compared to 13.2% for 2002. This increase relates to attrition in customer accounts acquired through our worldwide dealer program, as well as internally generated commercial customer accounts in continental Europe and internally generated residential customer accounts in the United States (both of which were partly driven by increased management and control of delinquent accounts). For those account pools experiencing increased attrition, prior lifing studies were re examined. The Company concluded that existing amortization methods and asset lives continue to be appropriate given the observed actual attrition data for these pools. Operating income and margin in 2002 include a net restructuring and other charge of $95 million. The net $95 million charge includes charges of $113 million, of which inventory write downs of $19 million are reflected in cost of sales. These charges are primarily related to severance and facility exit costs associated with streamlining the business, slightly offset by a credit of $18 million relating to current and prior years restructuring charges. Also included within operating income in 2002 is a charge of $18 million for the write off of purchased in process research and development associated with the acquisitions of Sensormatic and DSC and a charge of $115 million for the impairment of property, plant and equipment resulting primarily from the termination of a software development project and, to a lesser extent, from the curtailment, and in certain markets, the termination of the ADT dealer program in certain non U.S. markets. 32 Electronics The following table sets forth net revenue and operating income and margin for Electronics for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 ($ in millions): 2004 2003 2002 Revenue from product sales $ 11,372 $ 10,052 $ 10,151 Service revenue 450 440 441 Net revenue $ 11,822 $ 10,492 $ 10,592 Operating income $ 1,749 $ 1,241 $ (1,142 ) Operating margin 14.8 % 11.8 % (10.8 )% Net revenue for Electronics increased 12.7% in 2004 as compared to 2003, including a 13.1% increase in product revenue and a 2.3% increase in service revenue. The increase in net revenue was primarily a result of growth in our existing businesses, specifically, the automotive, computer, consumer electronics, communications and industrial and commercial markets. However, we continue to experience a decrease in sales of Power Systems products in North America and in our Electrical Contracting Services, which was divested in September 2004. To a lesser extent, the increase in net revenue resulted from favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates ($560 million). The 40.9% increase in operating income and the 3.0% increase in margin in 2004 as compared to 2003 were primarily due to the revenue growth discussed above, cost saving initiatives that were executed in 2003, the positive impact of foreign currency ($90 million) and fewer charges recorded in 2004 as compared to 2003. These increases in operating income were partially offset by an 80 basis point impact of increased metal prices for copper and gold. Operating income for 2004 includes net restructuring, divestiture and impairment charges totaling $22 million. These net charges include a $52 million charge related to the divestiture of the Electrical Contracting Services business, partially offset by $33 million of net restructuring credits related to changes in estimates of severance, facility exit costs, distributor and supplier cancellation fees recorded in prior periods and the impact of the sale of assets that were impaired in prior years for amounts greater than originally anticipated. These net charges also include a $3 million charge related to the impairment of property, plant and equipment. Net revenue for Electronics decreased slightly in 2003 as compared to 2002. Net revenue at the electronic components group increased $442 million, or 4.5% due primarily to the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Net revenue for the submarine telecommunications business declined $542 million, or 79.9%, due to completion of third party undersea fiber optic system installations in 2002. Overall, the decrease in net revenue for the submarine telecommunications business more than offset the increase in total net revenue due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $524 million, and $69 million (calculated in the manner described below in "Acquisitions") due to the acquisitions of Transpower Technologies in November 2001, Communications Instruments, Inc. in January 2002, and all other acquisitions with a purchase price of $10 million or more. The increase in operating income and margin in 2003 as compared to 2002 was due to operating losses in the prior year, primarily as a result of charges totaling $1,965 million (discussed below) that were recorded in 2002. Operating income and margin for 2003 include net charges totaling $236 million. The $236 million consists primarily of charges for the impairment of goodwill of $278 million in Power Systems, Electrical Contracting Services and the Printed Circuit Group, restructuring credits of $72 million, of which $20 million is included in cost of sales, related primarily to changes in estimates of severance and facility exit costs recorded in prior years and charges for the impairment of long lived assets of $1 million. The net restructuring credit of $72 million includes $55 million of credits, which were changes in estimates recorded in connection with the Companys intensified internal audits and detailed controls and operating reviews performed during 2003. Also 33 included within the $236 million are charges of $14 million related to adjusting asset reserves, $6 million related to the adjustments to accrual balances, $9 million of reconciliation and other accounting adjustments, which were also recorded in connection with the Companys intensified internal audits and detailed controls and operating reviews performed during 2003. The operating loss in 2002 was primarily due to restructuring and other charges as well as the impairment of long lived assets and goodwill in addition to the decrease in revenue. In the electronic components business, the overall decrease in demand resulted in much lower manufacturing volumes across all business units, which increased per unit costs. In the Submarine Telecommunications business, margin was impacted significantly by a significant reduction in third party system builds. Operating loss and margin for 2002 include net restructuring and other charges of $1,115 million. The $1,115 million net charge includes charges totaling $1,141 million, of which inventory reserves of $609 million are included in cost of sales. These charges primarily relate to initiatives taken to reduce fixed costs, due to the significant downturn in the telecommunications business and certain electronics end markets, including facility closures, headcount reductions, inventory reserves and purchase commitment cancellations. These charges were slightly offset by a restructuring credit of $26 million primarily relating to a revision in estimates of current and prior years severance and facilities charges. Total inventory charges of $833 million include $609 million of inventory write downs and $212 million of supplier contract termination fees. In 2002, $20 million was originally included in the inventory written down and was recorded as a restructuring credit to cost of sales in 2003. Also included within operating loss and margins for 2002 are charges of $569 million for the impairment of long lived assets, and goodwill impairment charges of $281 million related to Tyco Submarine Telecommunications. Healthcare The following table sets forth net revenue and operating income and margin for Healthcare for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 ($ in millions): 2004 2003 2002 Revenue from product sales $ 9,040 $ 8,344 $ 7,693 Service revenue 70 76 71 Net revenue $ 9,110 $ 8,420 $ 7,764 Operating income $ 2,365 $ 2,104 $ 1,833 Operating margin 26.0 % 25.0 % 23.6 % Net revenue for Healthcare increased 8.2% in 2004 as compared to 2003. The increase in net revenue resulted primarily from growth in our existing businesses and favorable foreign currency exchange rates ($292 million). Growth in Healthcares underlying businesses was primarily a result of increased net revenue within Medical Devices & Supplies, and to a lesser extent, at Pharmaceuticals. The increase at Medical Devices & Supplies was largely driven by higher sales volume within our International division, particularly in Europe, due to benefits realized from the sales force investment, back order recovery, growth in Spain and Italy and the absence of an unfavorable $47 million contractual adjustment recorded in 2003. Also contributing to the increase in Medical Devices and Supplies were higher sales within the Medical division resulting primarily from new SharpSafety product launches and gain in market share within the wound care market. The 12.4% increase in operating income in 2004 as compared to 2003 was due primarily to the favorable margin impact of the increased sales discussed above, favorable foreign currency exchange rates and a continued focus on maximizing operating efficiencies. Operating income was adversely impacted by a $29 million increase in legal liabilities for an ongoing patent infringement suit, and a $59 million increase in research and development costs. Additionally, 2004 operating income includes 34 net restructuring, divestiture and impairment charges of $18 million, composed of: (i) restructuring charges of $13 million related to the closure of various facilities offset by a credit of $2 million due to costs being less than anticipated; (ii) a $4 million divestiture charge resulting from a loss on the sale of a business and (iii) $3 million of impairment charges related to the closure of various facilities. Net revenue for Healthcare increased 8.4% in 2003 as compared to 2002, including an 8.5% increase in product revenue and a 7.0% increase in service revenue. The increase in net revenue resulted primarily from growth in our existing businesses and favorable foreign currency exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, acquisitions, net of divestitures. Growth in our existing businesses was due to the following: increases in the Surgical division concurrent with the award of a major contract and continued organic growth within certain surgical stapling lines; increases in the Medical division resulting from the award of a significant wound care contract, coupled with the exit of a major competitor from the traditional wound care business; new product launches and higher demand in the ultrasound market; increases in Pharmaceuticals and Imaging due to higher volumes and increased market share; and, strong sales within the Respiratory division. These sales increases were partially offset by a decrease in the diaper product segment of the Retail business largely resulting from the adverse impact of the industry wide down count issues, and a decline in the International division due to lower sales in continental Europe and Latin America. The increase in net revenue also resulted from favorable changes in foreign exchange rates ($268 million) and incremental revenue generated from the acquisition of Paragon Trade Brands ("Paragon") in January 2002 ($124 million calculated in the manner described below in "Acquisitions"), slightly offset by a decline in revenue ($48 million) related to the divestiture of Surgical Dynamics, Inc. in July 2002. The 14.8% increase in operating income and increase in margin in 2003 as compared to 2002 were due primarily to favorable margin impact as a result of higher sales and favorable manufacturing variances as a result of increased production volumes, a shift to a more favorable product mix, and cost savings as a result of the closure of certain Paragon facilities, back office consolidations and our continued focus on optimizing operating expenses. Slightly offsetting the effect of those items were increased legal fees, insurance and pension expense, and higher sales and marketing expense as a result of program development aimed at supporting organic growth initiatives. Also contributing to the increase in operating income and margins were favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. During 2003, we recorded net credits totaling $2 million, including restructuring credits of $8 million due to actual costs being less than anticipated, and a credit of $7 million related to an insurance reimbursement for certain legal fees associated with product liability cases. These credits were largely offset by charges of $12 million related to asset reserves for inventory and charges of $1 million for adjustments to accrual balances related to workers compensation, which were changes in estimates recorded in connection with the Companys intensified internal audits, detailed controls and operating reviews and as a result of applying managements judgments and estimates. Operating income and margin for 2002 reflect net restructuring and other charges of $45 million. The $45 million net charge includes charges of $49 million, of which inventory write downs of $1 million are included in cost of sales. These charges primarily relate to severance associated with the consolidation of operations and facility related costs due to exiting certain business lines, and are partially offset by a credit of $4 million relating to current and prior years restructuring charges. Operating income and margin for 2002 also include a charge for the impairment of long lived assets of $2 million. 35 Engineered Products and Services The following table sets forth net revenue and operating income and margin for Engineered Products and Services for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 ($ in millions): 2004 2003 2002 Revenue from product sales $ 4,582 $ 3,824 $ 3,888 Service revenue 1,425 674 645 Net revenue $ 6,007 $ 4,498 $ 4,533 Operating income $ 620 $ 362 $ 251 Operating margin 10.3 % 8.0 % 5.5 % Net revenue for Engineered Products and Services increased $1,509 million or 33.5% in 2004 as compared to 2003, of which $739 million, or 16.4%, represents a change in how we classify certain sub contract and other costs that are paid by Infrastructure Services and re billed to their customers. These costs have historically been treated as "pass through" and were therefore not included in reported revenue and cost of revenue of Infrastructure Services. For the year ended September 30, 2004, the Company began reflecting these sub contract costs in both revenue and cost of revenue of Infrastructure Services. The Company has not adjusted revenue or cost of revenue for the years ended September 30, 2003 and 2002 as such change was not material. Further, such adjustment would have no impact on previously reported operating income, net income (loss) or cash flow. The remaining increase in net revenue resulted primarily from increased demand and higher selling prices at Electrical & Metal Products and at Tyco Fire & Building Products and favorable foreign currency exchange rates in all businesses ($298 million). Further contributing to the increase, although to a much lesser extent, were improved business conditions at Infrastructure Services due primarily to an improved construction market and continued market share growth. Sales remained flat at Flow Control as the impact of lower levels of non residential construction and industrial capital spending, primarily in North America, were offset by improved activity in other end markets and geographic regions. The 71.3% increase in operating income and the 2.3% increase in margin in 2004 as compared to 2003 were due primarily to increased net revenue discussed above, the impact of cost reduction programs initiated in prior periods and the positive impact of foreign currency ($31 million). These favorable increases were partly offset by the impact of higher raw material costs. Additionally, operating income includes net restructuring, impairment and divestiture charges of $62 million in 2004 compared to $56 million (discussed below) in 2003. Included in the $62 million charge is $53 million of restructuring and $4 million of impairment charges related to the consolidation of manufacturing, distribution and office locations and activities at Flow Control and Infrastructure Services. The remaining $5 million divestiture charge primarily relates to an impairment of goodwill related to the sale of a business. The revenue reclassification at Infrastructure Services discussed above had no impact on operating income for 2004; however, this adjustment lowered 2004 operating margin by 1.5 percentage points. Net revenue for Engineered Products and Services slightly decreased in 2003 as compared to 2002, including a 1.6% decrease in product revenue partially offset by a 4.5% increase in service revenue. Net revenue decreased year over year, as the increase in net revenue due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates ($219 million) and the effect of acquisitions ($41 million calculated in a manner described below in "Acquisitions") was more than offset by weak conditions in major markets at Flow Control and Electrical & Metal Products, most notably in non residential construction. Also contributing to the overall decrease were lower levels of capital spending and increased pricing pressure, resulting in lower selling prices. The $41 million effect from acquisitions included Century 36 Tube Corporation in October 2001, Water & Power Technologies in November 2001, Clean Air Systems in February 2002 and all other acquisitions with a purchase price of $10 million or more. The 44.2% increase in operating income and the increase in margin in 2003 compared to 2002 was due to lower than usual operating income in the prior year period as a result of recording charges of $377 million (discussed below). During 2003, we recorded charges totaling $56 million, which includes charges of $32 million related to changes in estimates recorded in connection with the Companys intensified internal audits, detailed controls and operating reviews, and as a result of applying managements judgments and estimates (including $19 million related to adjustments to workers compensation and $13 million associated with asset reserves). These charges also include charges of $8 million, of which a $6 million charge is included in cost of sales, for 2003 restructuring plans partially offset by changes in estimates due to actual costs being less than originally anticipated, charges for the impairment of long lived assets of $2 million relating to manufacturing and distribution consolidation at Flow Control and cost reduction projects, and other costs of $14 million included within selling, general and administrative expenses primarily related to the reorganization and consolidation of a manufacturing facility and certain business offices. Operating income and margin were also negatively impacted by the lower sales discussed above, competitive conditions in major markets for valves and controls, thermal controls, and electrical and metal products, and increased raw material costs, primarily steel. Operating income and margin for 2002 reflect $377 million of restructuring and other charges consisting of $48 million, of which inventory write downs of $6 million are included in cost of sales, primarily related to severance and facility exit costs associated with streamlining the business. Also included are charges of $10 million for the impairment of property, plant and equipment associated with the closure of facilities, and goodwill impairment charges of $319 million relating to Tyco Infrastructure Services. Plastics and Adhesives The following table sets forth net revenue and operating income and margin for Plastics and Adhesives for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 ($ in millions): 2004 2003 2002 Revenue from product sales $ 1,742 $ 1,731 $ 1,722 Operating income $ 69 $ 171 $ 196 Operating margin 4.0 % 9.9 % 11.4 % Net revenue increased slightly in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to an increase in price ($44 million) and volume ($4 million) in Plastics. Additionally, foreign currency had a positive impact of $9 million on net revenue, and increased volume in Ludlow Coated Products ($5 million) from its building products and flexible packaging business also contributed to the overall increase. These increases were largely offset by softness in A&E Products ($49 million), particularly in the Americas Hangers business, in Asia and in the Catering business and a slight decline in Adhesives sales volume in the Corrosion Protection business. The significant decreases in operating income and operating margin in 2004 as compared to 2003 were primarily due to impairment ($47 million) and restructuring charges ($44 million) incurred during 2004 totaling $91 million associated with the closure of various facilities. The decreases in net revenue discussed above and margin declines at A&E Products due to lower volumes and pricing pressure also contributed to the decrease in operating income and margin. Operating income and margin for 2003 includes a net credit of $1 million discussed below. Net revenue at Tyco Plastics and Adhesives increased slightly in 2003 as compared to 2002 due to the effect of favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates ($38 million) and acquisitions 37 ($21 million calculated in the manner described below in "Acquisitions"), which included LINQ Industrial Fabrics, Inc. in December 2001 and all other acquisitions with a purchase price of $10 million or more. Sales increases were achieved by higher selling prices as a result of higher raw material costs, increased sales volume of plastic sheeting and duct tape products as a result of the heightened level of security related to the potential likelihood of terrorist attacks, and a strong residential construction market for Ludlow Coated Products. These increases were more than offset by increased competition and decreases in our Corrosion Protection business, which had been negatively impacted by a slow down in the oil and gas pipeline construction markets created by uncertainty in the Middle East and Venezuela, and a decline in hanger sales due to weak demand in the retail garment industry. The significant decrease in operating income and decrease in operating margin in 2003 as compared to 2002 were primarily due to increased raw material costs (primarily polyethylene) and increased pricing competition driven by excess production capacity and an increase in lower priced imported goods. During 2003, Tyco Plastics and Adhesives recorded net credits totaling $1 million. These credits include charges of $6 million related to changes in estimates recorded in connection with the Companys intensified internal audits, detailed controls and operating reviews and as a result of applying managements judgments and estimates (including $3 million for adjustments to accrual balances, and $3 million related to asset reserves for inventory), restructuring credits of $1 million due to costs being less than anticipated and a credit of $6 million related to the settlement of a lawsuit. Operating income and margin for 2002 reflect net restructuring and other charges of $10 million, of which inventory write downs of $1 million are included in cost of sales. These charges primarily relate to severance associated with the consolidation of operations and facility related costs due to exiting certain business lines. Operating income and margins for 2002 also include a charge for the write off of long lived assets of $3 million primarily related to the impairment of long lived assets. Corporate and Other Corporate net revenue of $25 million, $14 million and $8 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, relates to the TGN business, which is classified as held for sale. Corporate expense was $385 million, $1,161 million and $3,510 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, which includes operating losses of $73 million, $760 million and $3,090 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, related to the TGN business held for sale. Corporate expense for 2004 includes net charges of $14 million, which consists of charges for the impairment of long lived assets of $8 million and net restructuring charges of $6 million primarily attributable to severance related to the relocation of the corporate headquarters. Corporate expense for 2003 includes charges totaling $824 million. Included within the $824 million is a charge of $91 million for an incremental increase in directors and officers insurance and charges of $39 million related to internal investigation fees. Also included is a charge of $20 million primarily related to severance and benefits for corporate employees and a restructuring credit of $11 million due to actual costs being less than anticipated, both of which were changes in estimates recorded in connection with the Companys intensified internal audits, detailed controls and operating reviews and as a result of applying managements judgments and estimates. Also included within the $824 million are net restructuring credits of $10 million, other net charges of $16 million included in selling, general and administrative expenses, and charges for the impairment of long lived assets of $679 million primarily related to the TGN business held for sale and, to a lesser extent, the closure and relocation of corporate offices and related severance and benefits. 38  Corporate expense in 2002 includes net restructuring, impairment and other charges of $3,914 million including $2,582 million related to the impairment of the TGN, $29 million related to the impairment of certain properties associated with the consolidation of corporate headquarters, $744 million related to goodwill impairment within the TGN business held for sale, and net restructuring and other charges of $559 million primarily related to charges within the TGN business held for sale and, to a lesser extent, the write off of investment banking fees and other deal costs associated with the terminated breakup plan and certain acquisitions that were not completed, costs incurred for the internal investigation, and severance. The significant restructuring charges recorded in 2002 were primarily related to the restructuring of the TGN business held for sale to address the significant overcapacity in the market and resulting lack of demand for new system construction. In the fourth quarter of 2002, management decided to focus the business for the foreseeable future on maintenance revenue and capacity sales on the TGN, to discontinue future additions to the TGN, and to limit construction activities to small projects that were cash flow positive with at least breakeven earnings. As a result of this strategy, management devised a plan to significantly downsize the manufacturing footprint, decrease project management staffing, reduce the research and development function and minimize staffing and expense in all other administrative areas of the business to decrease cash outflows and losses to the maximum extent possible. This plan was carefully crafted to ensure that both the technical and construction competencies of the business would be preserved in the event industry conditions improve. Results by Geographic Area Net revenue by geographic area for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 is as follows ($ in millions): 2004 2003 2002 Net revenue: United States $ 21,156 $ 19,822 $ 20,292 Other Americas 2,169 1,844 2,007 Europe 11,018 9,366 8,026 Asia Pacific 5,810 4,955 4,499 Net revenue(1) $ 40,153 $ 35,987 $ 34,824 (1)Revenue from external customers are attributed to individual countries based on the reporting entity that records the transaction. Interest Income and Expense Interest income was $91 million in 2004, as compared to $107 million and $117 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Interest expense was $963 million in 2004, as compared to $1,148 million in 2003 and $1,076 million in 2002. The decrease in interest expense in 2004 as compared to 2003 is primarily the result of a lower average debt balance in 2004 and the favorable impact of interest rate swap agreements executed during the year. The increase in interest expense in 2003 over 2002 is primarily the result of the benefit from the cancellation of certain swaps in 2002 and a decrease in capitalized interest due to the completion of the TGN, partially offset by a lower average outstanding debt balance during 2003. The weighted average rates of interest on total debt outstanding during 2004, 2003 and 2002 were 5.4%, 4.9% and 4.5%, respectively. The weighted average interest rate during 2004 increased due to the retirement of lower interest rate debt. 39 Other Expense, Net During 2004, net other expense of $286 million consisted primarily of a $284 million loss related to the repurchase of a portion of its outstanding convertible debt prior to its scheduled maturity. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding debt repurchases. During 2003, net other expense of $223 million consisted primarily of a net loss on the retirement of debt of $128 million. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding debt repurchases. Additionally, net other expense included an $87 million loss relating to the write down of various investments when it became evident that the declines in the fair value of the investments were other than temporary, predominately due to the continuing depressed economic conditions, specifically within the telecommunications industry. During 2002, net other expense of $217 million consisted primarily of a $271 million loss on various investments, mainly related to its investments in FLAG Telecom Holdings Ltd. ("FLAG") when it became evident that the declines in the fair value of FLAG and other investments were other than temporary. This loss was partially offset by a gain of $30 million related to the retirement of debt and a net gain on divestiture of $24 million (see "Divestitures and Discontinued Operations" below). Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 27.4%, 42.2% and (7.6)% for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decline in the effective rate from 2003 to 2004 is principally the result of increased profitability in operations primarily in jurisdictions with lower tax rates and a decrease in nondeductible charges. The change in the effective tax rate from 2002 to 2003 is primarily the result of a decrease in impairment and other charges which did not provide a tax benefit and a decrease in other non deductible charges. During 2004, the Company made substantial changes to its tax reporting and compliance processes, including preparation of amended U.S. federal income tax returns, hiring and training of additional tax personnel and the completion of a comprehensive review, analysis and reconciliation of its deferred tax assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2003 and September 30, 2004. The presentation of deferred tax assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2003 has been reclassified for comparability purposes as a result of this comprehensive deferred tax analysis. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $1,992 million and $1,879 million at September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109 which requires a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is "more likely than not" that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company and its subsidiaries income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. The Company is currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") for the years 1997 to 2000. In connection with such examinations, certain tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax deficiencies. The Company is reviewing the issues raised by the tax authorities and is contesting certain proposed tax deficiencies. Amounts related to these tax deficiencies and other tax contingencies that management has assessed as probable and estimable have been recorded through the income tax provision. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. 40 These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by these taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as payment is not expected within one year. In connection with the IRS audits for the years 1997 2000, the Company prepared proposed amendments to these prior period U.S. federal income tax returns resulting in a reduction in the taxable income previously reported. The IRS is currently reviewing the proposed amendments. The Company has not recorded the impact of the proposed amendments, pending the completion of the IRS review. The proposed amendments, if accepted, will result in receipt of refunds or credits and a corresponding reduction to the deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company may prepare proposed amendments to prior period U.S. federal income tax returns for additional periods. The proposed amendments are not expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Except for earnings that are currently distributed, no additional provision has been made for U.S. or non U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or the Company has concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of distribution of such earnings. A liability could arise if amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries. Divestitures and Discontinued Operations During 2003, we conducted a comprehensive review of our core businesses, and as a result, implemented a divestiture program in early 2004. This strategy is intended to sharpen our focus on core businesses, simplify operations and improve cost structure. This divestiture program is designed to increase the focus on our core operations by exiting certain operations that do not meet our criteria for strategic fit or financial returns. In November 2003, we estimated that the potential proceeds excluding the proceeds from the sale of the TGN could be at least $400 million once the program is completed. Cumulative proceeds through the date of this filing are approximately $412 million. As part of this program, we planned to sell the TGN, our undersea fiber optic telecommunications network. The market for the TGN is challenged by significant overcapacity and severe pricing pressure and the industry is in need of consolidation. However, we plan to retain ownership of the telecommunications systems supply business which provides maintenance and undersea cable construction. In November 2004, we agreed to sell the TGN to one of Indias telephone and internet service providers for $130 million. As discussed in Note 3, the entire value of the TGN has been written off. The sale is subject to governmental approval in the United States, India and other countries. 2004 Activity During 2004, the Company recorded net losses and impairments of divestitures of $116 million in continuing operations in connection with the divestiture or write down to fair value of certain held for sale businesses. In addition, the Company also recorded losses on the sale of discontinued operations of $132 million ($123 million after tax) to write the carrying value of such assets down to their estimated fair value. 41 In connection with the divestiture program announced in November 2003, the Company divested twenty one and liquidated four non core businesses across all business segments, except Plastics and Adhesives and primarily within Fire and Security, for aggregate proceeds of $252 million in cash, of which $16 million of the proceeds are currently held in escrow. Total assets and total liabilities of the divested businesses were $445 million and $115 million, respectively. Total assets include cash retained by the businesses sold of $13 million. Subsequent to September 30, 2004, the Company divested an additional seven non core businesses realizing aggregate proceeds of approximately $160 million. Net revenue and net loss for 2004 through the date of disposition were $460 million and $43 million, respectively, for divested companies that did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations. Net revenue and net income for the year ended September 30, 2003 were $587 million and $24 million, respectively, for divested companies that did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations. Net revenue of 2004 discontinued operations for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $889 million, $815 million and $766 million, respectively. Pretax (loss) income of these discontinued operations for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $(135) million, $7 million and $19 million, respectively. The following table presents balance sheet information for discontinued operations and other businesses held for sale at September 30, 2004 and 2003 ($ in millions): 2004 2003 Accounts receivable, net $ 209 $ 160 Inventories 95 61 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 95 27 Property, plant and equipment, net 96 121 Other assets 120 120 Total assets $ 615 $ 489 Accounts payable $ 155 $ 119 Accrued and other current liabilities 243 73 Other liabilities 125 Total liabilities $ 523 $ 192 2003 Activity During 2003, Tyco recorded income from discontinued operations of $20 million for a restitution payment made by Frank E. Walsh Jr., a former director (see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 2002 Activity During 2002, the Company sold certain of its businesses for net proceeds of $139 million in cash that consisted primarily of businesses within Healthcare and Fire and Security. In connection with these dispositions, the Company recorded a net gain of $24 million, which is included in other expense, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. On July 8, 2002, the Company divested Tyco Capital (CIT Group Inc.) through the sale of 100% of the common shares of CIT Group Inc. ("CIT"), its principal operating subsidiary, in an initial public offering ("IPO"). Accordingly, the results of Tyco Capital are presented as discontinued operations. Operating results from the discontinued operations of Tyco Capital from October 1, 2001 through July 8, 2002 were $3.3 billion of finance income, $6.0 billion of pre tax loss and $6.3 billion of net loss. The net loss includes a goodwill impairment charge of $6,638 million. 42 During the quarter ended March 31, 2002, Tyco experienced disruptions to its business surrounding its announced break up plan, a downgrade in its credit ratings, and a significant decline in its market capitalization. During this same time period, CIT also experienced credit downgrades and a disruption to its historical funding base. Further, market based information developed in connection with the Companys preliminary consideration of the proposed IPO of CIT indicated that CITs book value exceeded its estimated fair value as of March 31, 2002. As a result, the Company performed a SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," first step impairment analysis as of March 31, 2002 and concluded that an impairment charge was warranted at that time. Managements objective in performing the first step goodwill impairment analysis was to obtain relevant market based data to calculate the estimated fair value of CIT as of March 31, 2002 based on its projected earnings and market factors expected to be used by market participants in ascribing value to CIT in the planned separation of CIT from Tyco. Management obtained relevant market data from financial advisors regarding the range of price to earnings multiples and market condition discounts applicable to CIT as of March 31, 2002 and applied these market data to CITs projected annual earnings as of March 31, 2002 to calculate an estimated fair value and any resulting goodwill impairment. The estimated fair value was compared to the corresponding carrying value of CIT at March 31, 2002. As a result, the Company recorded a $4,513 million impairment charge as of March 31, 2002, which is included in discontinued operations. A second step goodwill impairment analysis is required whenever a reporting units book value exceeds estimated fair value. This analysis required the Company to estimate the fair value of the reporting units individual assets and liabilities to complete the analysis of goodwill as of March 31, 2002. The Company completed this second step analysis for CIT during the quarter ended June 30, 2002 and, as a result, recorded an additional goodwill impairment charge of $132 million. During the June 30, 2002 quarter, CIT experienced further credit downgrades and the business environment and other factors continued to negatively impact the likely proceeds of the IPO. As a result, the Company performed another first step and second step analysis as of June 30, 2002 in a manner consistent with the March 2002 process described above. Each of these analyses was based upon updated market data at June 30, 2002 and through the period immediately following the IPO, including the IPO proceeds. These analyses resulted in a goodwill impairment of $1,867 million. Tyco also recorded an additional impairment charge of $126 million in order to write down its investment in CIT to fair value for a total CIT goodwill impairment of $2,125 million. This write down was based upon net IPO proceeds of approximately $4.4 billion, after deducting estimated out of pocket expenses, and is included in the $6,283 million loss from discontinued operations. During the fourth quarter of 2002, Tyco recorded a loss on the sale of Tyco Capital of $59 million. Acquisitions Prior to 2003, acquisitions were a significant element of our growth strategy. When we acquired a business, we began to integrate the acquired company with our existing operations immediately, and, consequently, we were generally unable to separately identify the post acquisition financial results of acquired companies. The revenue growth or decline attributable to such acquisitions, which are included in segment discussions for 2003 and 2002, were estimates calculated by assuming the acquisitions were made at the beginning of the relevant year by adding back pre acquisition revenue of the acquired companies for both periods. These calculations included all acquisitions with a purchase price of $10 million or more and did not include acquisitions with a purchase price of less than $10 million, due to the relative size of these smaller acquisitions compared to Tycos operating results and the large number of acquisitions during 2003 and 2002. These smaller acquisitions represent approximately 6% of the total purchase price for all acquisitions during 2003 and 2002. Since these estimates are based on pre acquisition revenue, they are not necessarily indicative of post acquisition results. This calculation is similar to the method used in calculating the acquisition related pro forma 43 results of operations in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements pursuant to SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations." Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change As discussed in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has three synthetic lease programs utilized, to some extent, by all of the Companys segments to finance capital expenditures for manufacturing machinery and equipment and for ships used by Tyco Submarine Telecommunications. During 2003, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation ("FIN") No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," (revised December 2003 as FIN No. 46R) and, accordingly, restructured one of the synthetic leases to meet the requirements of FIN 46 for off balance sheet accounting. The Company reclassified the remaining two leases as capital leases and, consequently, recorded a $75 million after tax loss ($115 million pretax) cumulative effect adjustment. In addition, total debt increased by $498 million at the time of consolidation, July 1, 2003. In 2003 in conjunction with adopting FIN 46, the Company also evaluated other investments and concluded that four joint ventures that were previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting within Tyco Infrastructure Services, in which we own a minority interest, met the consolidation criteria set forth in FIN 46. Accordingly, these ventures were consolidated onto the Companys balance sheet effective July 1, 2003. The assets and liabilities of these joint ventures included on the Companys balance sheet at that time were $112 million and $96 million, respectively. Subsequently, these four joint ventures were deconsolidated as of March 31, 2004 with the adoption of FIN 46R. The assets and liabilities of these joint ventures included in the Companys balance sheet at September 30, 2003 were $96 million and $69 million, respectively. Change in Fiscal Year On November 4, 2004, the Board of Directors approved the change in our fiscal year end from a calendar fiscal year ending September 30 to a "52 53 week" year ending on the Friday nearest September 30, such that each quarterly period will be 13 weeks in length. Once every seven years, starting in 2011, the fourth quarter reporting period will be 14 weeks. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries have consistently closed their books up to one month prior to our fiscal period end. We plan to report results for these subsidiaries using the same period as the reported results of the consolidated Company. While the expected December holiday related slow down in certain customer sales is expected to shift from the second fiscal quarter to the first fiscal quarter, the impact of this change is not expected to be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This change is also consistent with our ongoing efforts to enhance controls and improve the transparency of its reporting, as this change better aligns our external reporting with our internal operational processes. This change will be effective for our first fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2004. The results for the transition period related to this change will be reported as an adjustment within Shareholders Equity. No transition report is required for these changes.  Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ("GAAP") requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. 44 Depreciation and Amortization Method for Security Monitoring Systems Tyco generally considers its electronic security assets in three asset pools: internally generated residential systems, internally generated commercial systems and customer accounts acquired through the ADT dealer program. The determination of the depreciable lives of subscriber systems included in property, plant and equipment, and the amortizable lives of customer contracts and related customer relationships included in intangible assets, are primarily based on historical attrition rates, third party lifing studies and the useful life of the underlying tangible asset. The realizable value and remaining useful lives of these assets could be impacted by changes in customer attrition rates. If the attrition rates were to rise, Tyco may be required to accelerate the depreciation and amortization. With respect to Tycos depreciation policy for security monitoring systems installed in residential and commercial customer premises, the costs of these systems are combined in separate pools for internally generated residential and internally generated commercial account customers (collectively "subscriber systems"), and generally depreciated over ten to fourteen years. Tyco concluded that for residential and commercial account pools the straight line method of depreciation over a ten to fourteen year period continues to be appropriate given the observed actual attrition data for these pools. Tyco purchases residential security monitoring contracts from an external network of independent dealers who operate under the ADT dealer program. The purchase price of these customer contracts is recorded as an intangible asset (i.e., contracts and related customer relationships). Intangible assets arising from the ADT dealer program are amortized in pools determined by the month of contract acquisition on an accelerated basis over the period and pattern of economic benefit that is expected to be obtained from the customer relationship. Tyco believes that the accelerated method that presently best achieves the matching objective described above is the double declining balance method based on a ten year life for the first eight years of the estimated life of the customer relationships converting to the straight line method of amortization for the remaining four years of the estimated relationship period. Actual attrition data is regularly reviewed in order to assess the continued applicability of the accelerated method of amortization described above. Attrition rates for customers in our Global Electronic Security Services business were 15.1%, 15.9% and 13.2% on a trailing 12 month basis as of September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Goodwill In performing the annual goodwill assessment, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. Since managements judgment is involved in performing goodwill valuation analyses, there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated or understated. We elected to make July 1 the annual impairment assessment date for all reporting units. Goodwill valuations have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. This approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors and income tax rates. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in a goodwill impairment in future periods. Disruptions to our business such as end market conditions and protracted economic weakness, unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units, the divestiture of a significant component of a reporting unit and market capitalization declines may result in our having to perform a SFAS No. 142 first step valuation analysis for some or all of our reporting units prior to the required annual assessment. These types of events and the resulting analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future. 45 During 2004, the Company recorded goodwill impairments of $60 million of which $48 million related to divested businesses and $12 million related to businesses classified as held for sale, respectively. The Company also recorded goodwill impairments of $278 million and $1,344 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Revenue Recognition Contract sales for the installation of fire protection systems, large security intruder systems, undersea cable systems and other construction related projects are recorded primarily on the percentage of completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon contracted revenue and related estimated cost to completion. The risk of this methodology is its dependence upon estimates of costs to completion, which are subject to the uncertainties inherent in long term contracts. Revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they first become determinable. If estimates are inaccurate, there is risk that our revenue and profits for the period may be overstated or understated. Income Taxes In determining income (loss) for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. Deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and international pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income. Any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. If a change in a valuation allowance occurs, which was established in connection with an acquisition, such adjustment may impact goodwill rather than the income tax provision. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If the tax 46 liabilities relate to tax uncertainties existing at the date of the acquisition of a business, the adjustment of such tax liabilities will result in an adjustment to the goodwill recorded at the date of acquisition. Long Lived Assets Assets held and used by the Company, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of evaluating the recoverability of long lived assets to be held and used, a recoverability test is performed based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk. Impairments to long lived assets to be disposed of are recorded based upon the fair value of the applicable assets. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of long lived assets, there is a risk that the carrying value of our long lived assets may be overstated or understated.  Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes the sources of our cash flow from operating activities and the use of a portion of that cash in our operations for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 ($ in millions): 2004 2003 2002 Cash flows from operating activities: Operating income (loss) $ 5,317 $ 3,059 $ (1,472 ) Non cash restructuring and other (credits) charges, net (30 ) (46 ) 796 Impairment of long lived assets 99 825 3,310 Non cash losses (gains) and impairments on divestitures, net 111 (24 ) Goodwill impairment 278 1,344 Write off of purchased in process research and development 18 Depreciation and amortization(1) 2,176 2,183 2,073 Deferred income taxes 172 357 (578 ) Provision for losses on accounts receivable and inventory 321 580 499 Debt and refinancing cost amortization 55 116 194 Other, net(2) 81 100 112 Net (increase) decrease in working capital 23 (226 ) 368 Decrease in sale of accounts receivable (929 ) (119 ) (56 ) Interest income 91 107 117 Interest expense (963 ) (1,148 ) (1,076 ) Income tax expense (1,140 ) (757 ) (202 ) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 5,384 $ 5,309 $ 5,423 Other cash flow items: Capital expenditures, net(3) $ (1,015 ) $ (1,274 ) $ (2,823 ) Dividends paid (100 ) (101 ) (100 ) Decrease in sale of accounts receivable 929 119 56 Acquisition of customer accounts (ADT dealer program) (254 ) (597 ) (1,138 ) Cash paid for purchase accounting and holdback/earn out liabilities (107 ) (272 ) (625 ) (1)This amount is the sum of depreciation ($1,478 million, $1,459 million and $1,454 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively) and amortization of intangible assets ($698 million, $724 million and $619 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively). (2)This amount includes the add back of net losses on the retirement of debt of $284 million and $128 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, and income from the retirement of debt of $33 million in 2002. (3)This includes net proceeds of $141 million, $124 million and $166 million received for the sale/disposition of property, plant and equipment in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. It also includes proceeds of $30 million received in sale leaseback transactions in 2002. 47 The following table shows cash flow from operating activities and other cash flow items by segment for the year ended September 30, 2004 ($ in millions): Fire and Security Electronics Healthcare Engineered Products and Services Plastics and Adhesives Corporate and Other Total Cash flows from operating activities: Operating income (loss) $ 899 $ 1,749 $ 2,365 $ 620 $ 69 $ (385 ) $ 5,317 Non cash restructuring and other charges (credits), net 4 (33 ) (1 ) 4 (4 ) (30 ) Impairment of long lived assets 34 3 3 4 47 8 99 Non cash losses and impairments on divestitures, net 51 51 4 5 111 Depreciation 589 472 249 114 50 4 1,478 Intangible assets amortization 543 68 78 2 7 698 Depreciation and amortization 1,132 540 327 116 57 4 2,176 Deferred income taxes 172 172 Provision for losses on accounts receivable and inventory 150 54 63 50 4 321 Debt and refinancing cost amortization 55 55 Net decrease (increase) in working capital and other(1) (154 ) (197 ) (157 ) (45 ) 8 649 104 Decrease in sale of accounts receivable(2) (97 ) (20 ) (112 ) (700 ) (929 ) Interest income 91 91 Interest expense (963 ) (963 ) Income tax expense (1,140 ) (1,140 ) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 2,019 $ 2,147 $ 2,493 $ 749 $ 189 $ (2,213 ) $ 5,384 Other cash flow items: Capital expenditures, net (335 ) (370 ) (239 ) (45 ) (28 ) 2 $ (1,015 ) Dividends paid (100 ) (100 ) Decrease in sale of accounts receivable programs 97 20 112 700 929 Acquisition of customer accounts (ADT dealer program) (254 ) (254 ) Cash paid for purchase accounting and holdback/earn out liabilities (31 ) (48 ) (12 ) (14 ) (2 ) (107 ) (1)This amount includes the add back of $284 million related to a loss on the retirement of debt. (2)Fire and Security and Electronics include $91 million and $21 million, respectively, related to Corporate programs. The net change in total working capital, net of the effects of divestitures and acquisitions, was a cash decrease of $906 million in 2004, including cash paid for restructuring and other charges of $266 million. The components of this change are set forth in detail in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The significant changes in working capital included a $225 million increase in inventories and a $153 million increase in accounts receivable, offset by an increase of $406 million in income taxes payable. Also, during 2004 we significantly decreased our participation in our sale of accounts receivable programs resulting in an additional $929 million increase in accounts receivable. We strive to maximize our cash flow by minimizing the working capital employed in our businesses. During 2004, 2003 and 2002 we paid out $266 million, $503 million and $518 million, respectively, in cash related to restructuring activities. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our restructuring activities. 48 During 2004, 2003 and 2002, Tyco paid $254 million, $597 million and $1,138 million of cash, respectively, to acquire 0.3 million, 0.6 million and 1.4 million customer contracts for electronic security services through the ADT dealer program. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, we paid $107 million, $272 million and $625 million, respectively, in cash for purchase accounting and holdback/earn out liabilities. Holdback liabilities represent a portion of the purchase price that is withheld from the seller pending finalization of the acquisition balance sheet. Certain acquisitions have provisions which require Tyco to make additional "earn out" payments to the sellers if the acquired company achieves certain milestones subsequent to its acquisition by Tyco. These earn out payments are tied to certain performance measures, such as revenue, gross margin or earnings growth. At September 30, 2004, the acquisition liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets were $123 million, of which $29 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and $94 million is included in other liabilities. In addition, holdback/earn out liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets were $167 million, of which $59 million are included in accrued and other current liabilities and $108 million are included in other liabilities. As previously discussed, during 2003, we conducted a comprehensive review of Tycos core businesses, and as a result, implemented a divestiture program in early 2004. In November 2003 we estimated that the potential proceeds, excluding the proceeds from the sale of the TGN, could be at least $400 million once the program is completed. Cumulative proceeds through the date of this filing are approximately $412 million. As part of this program, we planned to sell the TGN, our undersea fiber optic telecommunications network. In November 2004, we agreed to sell the TGN to one of Indias telephone and internet service providers for $130 million. As discussed in Note 3, the entire value of the TGN has been written off. The sale is subject to governmental approval in the United States, India and other countries. We continue to fund capital expenditures to improve the cost structure of our businesses, to invest in new processes and technology, and to maintain high quality production standards. During 2003 and 2002, we spent $113 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, on construction of the TGN. Construction of the TGN was completed during 2003. Consequently, the level of capital expenditures in Electronics decreased in 2004. The level of capital expenditures in the other segments is not expected to exceed depreciation in 2005 and is expected to increase slightly relative to the level of spending in 2004. The provision for income taxes relating to continuing operations in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for 2004 was $1,140 million, and the amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during the year was $550 million. The difference is due to timing differences, as well as net operating loss carryforward and carryback utilization. Capitalization Shareholders equity was $30.3 billion at September 30, 2004, compared to $26.4 billion at September 30, 2003. This increase was due primarily to net income of $2.9 billion and foreign currency translation of $704 million. At September 30, 2004, total debt decreased $4.2 billion to $16.7 billion, as compared to $21.0 billion at September 30, 2003. Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization (total debt and shareholders equity) was 36% at September 30, 2004 and 44% at September 30, 2003. The decrease in debt resulted principally from the repayments of debt detailed below partially offset by the issuance of $1.0 billion 6.0% notes due 2013 by Tyco International Group S.A. ("TIGSA") in November 2003. Our cash balance increased to $4,467 million at September 30, 2004, as compared to $4,186 million at September 30, 2003. 49 In November 2003, TIGSA issued $1.0 billion 6.0% notes due 2013 in a private placement offering. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Tyco. The net proceeds of approximately $988 million were used to repay a portion of the $2.0 billion outstanding under the 5 year revolving credit facility due 2006. These notes were subsequently exchanged for registered notes with substantially identical terms in an exchange offer that expired on May 3, 2004. In November 2003, holders of principal amount at maturity of $3,197 million of zero coupon convertible debentures due 2020 notified Tyco that they had exercised their option to require Tyco to repurchase their debentures at a price of $775.66 per $1,000 principal at maturity, representing the accreted value of the debentures on that date. On November 18, 2003, Tyco purchased these debentures for cash of $2,480 million. In December 2003, TIGSA entered into a $1.0 billion 364 day revolving bank credit facility, which includes a one year term out option, and a $1.5 billion 3 year revolving bank credit facility. These facilities have a variable interest rate based on LIBOR. The margin over LIBOR payable by TIGSA can vary based on changes in its credit rating. These new facilities replaced the $1.5 billion undrawn 364 day revolving credit facility, which had been due to expire in January 2004, and the $2.0 billion drawn 5 year revolving credit facility, which had been due to expire in February 2006. As of September 30, 2004, there were no outstanding borrowings under either facility. The $1.0 billion 364 day revolving credit facility expires on December 20, 2004, and we expect that the facility will be replaced by a $1.0 billion 5 year revolving credit facility prior to its expiration. The $1.5 billion 3 year revolving credit facility expires on December 22, 2006. In June 2004, the Company purchased $303 million of its 8.2% notes due 2008 for cash of $341 million, which resulted in a $38 million loss, including unamortized debt issuance costs, on the retirement of debt. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company repurchased $517 million of its outstanding 2.75% convertible senior debentures with a 2008 put option. The total purchase price paid was $750 million and the repurchase resulted in a $241 million loss on the retirement of debt, including the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs. Our bank credit agreements contain a number of financial covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and minimum levels of net worth, and other covenants that limit our ability to pledge assets and to make substantial payments in connection with our capital shares. At September 30, 2004, we had three synthetic lease facilities, of which one has since expired on December 10, 2004, with other covenants, including interest coverage and leverage ratios. Our outstanding indentures contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges, subsidiary debt and sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants is presently considered restrictive to our operations. We are currently in compliance with all of our debt covenants. In 2004, we made voluntary contributions to our pension plans totaling approximately $575 million. The above transactions support Tycos previously discussed strategy to strengthen its balance sheet by using a portion of its excess cash to reduce debt. We plan to use available cash to continue to fund internal growth and cost reduction opportunities within our businesses. Additionally, we believe that our cash flow generation capability will allow us to continue to strengthen the balance sheet and return capital to shareholders. While debt reduction remains our focus in the near term, we may consider an appropriate acquisition should the opportunity arise. On December 9, 2004, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend on our common shares from $0.0125 to $0.10 per share. 50 The following table details the trend of our debt ratings: At September 30, 2004 At September 30, 2003 Short Term Long Term Short Term Long Term Moodys Prime 3 Baa3 Not prime Ba2 Standard & Poors A2 BBB A3 BBB Fitch F2 BBB+ B BB During 2004, Fitch upgraded our rating on the senior unsecured debt of the Company, as well as on the unconditionally guaranteed debt of TIGSA, to BBB+ from BB, and raised our commercial paper rating to F2 from B. Standard and Poors upgraded our corporate credit and senior unsecured ratings to BBB from BBB and our short term corporate credit and commercial paper ratings to A2 from A3. Moodys upgraded our long term rating to Baa3 from Ba2, as well as our short term rating to Prime 3 from Not Prime. The security ratings set forth above are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 51   Commitments and Contingencies Contractual Obligations A summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for debt, minimum lease payment obligations under non cancelable operating leases and other obligations at September 30, 2004 is as follows ($ in millions): 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Debt(1) $ 2,116 $ 2,026 $ 764 $ 2,608 $ 1,648 $ 7,571 Operating leases(2) 658 529 377 273 212 862 Purchase obligations(3) 192 10 2 1 1 12 Total contractual cash obligations(4) $ 2,966 $ 2,565 $ 1,143 $ 2,882 $ 1,861 $ 8,445 (1)Includes capital lease obligations and excludes interest. (2)Includes obligations under an off balance sheet leasing arrangement under which a subsidiary of the Company has the option to buy five cable laying sea vessels (see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). (3)Purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of good and services. (4)Minimum pension funding requirements are not included as such amounts have not been determined for all periods presented. The minimum required contributions to our pension plans are expected to be approximately $194 million in 2005. At September 30, 2004, the Company had outstanding letters of credit and letters of guarantee in the amount of $1.6 billion. At September 30, 2004, TIGSA had unsecured credit facilities of $1.0 billion due December 20, 2004, and $1.5 billion due December 22, 2006, both of which were undrawn and available (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). We expect that the existing $1.0 billion facility will be replaced by a $1.0 billion 5 year revolving credit facility prior to its expiration. In addition, certain of the Companys operating subsidiaries have overdraft and similar types of facilities, which total $434 million, of which $326 million was undrawn and available at September 30, 2004. These facilities expire at various dates through the year 2013, most of which are renewable and are established primarily within our international operations. At September 30, 2004, the Company had a contingent liability of $80 million related to the 2001 acquisition of Com Net by Electronics. This represents the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of Com Net only after the construction and installation of a communications system for the State of Florida is finished and the State has approved the system based on the guidelines set forth in the contract. No provision has been made in the Consolidated Financial Statements, as the outcome of this contingency cannot be reasonably determined. In June 2004, TIGSA entered into a $500 million 3 year unsecured letter of credit facility. The facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit, supported by a related line of credit facility. TIGSA may only borrow under the line of credit agreement to reimburse the bank for obligations with respect to letters of credit issued under this facility. The covenants under this facility are substantially similar to TIGSAs bank credit facilities entered into during December 2003 and the indenture related to TIGSAs 6% notes due 2013 issued in November 2003. TIGSA would pay interest on any outstanding borrowings at a variable interest rate, based on the banks base rate or the Eurodollar rate, as defined. Upon the occurrence of certain credit events, the interest rate on the outstanding borrowings becomes fixed. The issuance of letters of credit under this facility during 2004 enabled the 52 Company to release approximately $480 million of restricted cash and investments. As of September 30, 2004, there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility. In the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Legal Matters Class Actions For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos securities class actions, shareholder derivative litigation, ERISA litigation and investigation, and litigation against our former senior management, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings. We are generally obligated to indemnify our directors and officers and our former directors and officers who are named as defendants in some or all of these matters to the extent required by Bermuda law. In addition, our insurance carriers may decline coverage, or our coverage may be insufficient to cover our expenses and liability, in some or all of these matters. We are unable at this time to estimate what our ultimate liability in these matters may be, and it is possible that we will be required to pay judgments or settlements and incur expenses, in excess of any insurance coverage, in aggregate amounts that would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or probable losses, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters. Investigation For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to governmental investigations related to Tyco see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Subpoenas and Document Requests From Governmental Entities. We cannot predict when these investigations will be completed, nor can we predict what the results of these investigations may be. It is possible that we will be required to pay material fines, consent to injunctions on future conduct, lose the ability to conduct business with government instrumentalities (which in turn could negatively impact our business with non governmental customers) or suffer other penalties, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. It is not possible to estimate the amount of loss, or range of possible loss, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters. Intellectual Property Litigation For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos intellectual property litigation, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Intellectual Property Litigation. Environmental Matters For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos environmental matters, see Item 1. Business Environmental Matters. Asbestos Matters Like many other companies, Tyco and some of our subsidiaries are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials. Consistent with the national trend of increased asbestos related litigation, we have observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits in the past several years. The majority of these cases have been filed against subsidiaries in Healthcare and Engineered Products and Services. A limited number of the cases allege premises liability, based on claims that individuals were exposed to asbestos while on a subsidiarys property. A majority of the cases involve product liability claims, based principally on allegations of past distribution 53 of heat resistant industrial products incorporating asbestos or the past distribution of industrial valves that incorporated asbestos containing gaskets or packing. Each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants. Tycos involvement in asbestos cases has been limited because our subsidiaries did not mine or produce asbestos. Furthermore, in our experience, a large percentage of these claims were never substantiated and have been dismissed by the courts. We will continue to vigorously defend these lawsuits and we have not suffered an adverse verdict in a trial court proceeding related to asbestos claims. When appropriate, we settle claims. However, the total amount paid to date to settle and defend all asbestos claims has been immaterial. As of September 30, 2004, there were approximately 14,500 asbestos liability cases pending against us and our subsidiaries. We believe that we and our subsidiaries have substantial indemnification protection and insurance coverage, subject to applicable deductibles, with respect to asbestos claims. These indemnitors and the relevant carriers typically have been honoring their duty to defend and indemnify. We believe that we have valid defenses to these claims and intend to continue to defend them vigorously. Additionally, based on our historical experience in asbestos litigation and an analysis of our current cases, we believe that we have adequate amounts recorded for potential settlements and adverse judgments in asbestos related litigation. While it is not possible at this time to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome of these asbestos related proceedings, we believe that the final outcome of all known and anticipated future claims, after taking into account our substantial indemnification rights and insurance coverage, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Income Tax Matters Tyco and its subsidiaries income tax returns are periodically examined by various regulatory tax authorities. In connection with such examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax deficiencies. We are reviewing the issues raised by the tax authorities and are contesting certain of the proposed tax deficiencies. Amounts related to these tax deficiencies and other tax contingencies that management has assessed as probable and estimable have been recorded through the income tax provision. We cannot provide assurance that the ultimate resolution of these tax deficiencies and contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "AJCA"), signed into law in October 2004, replaces an export incentive with a deduction from domestic manufacturing income. It is not expected that the AJCA will have a material impact on the Companys income tax provision. The AJCA also allows the Company to repatriate up to $500 million of permanently reinvested foreign earnings in 2005 or 2006 at an effective tax rate of 5.25%. The Company is currently reviewing whether to take advantage of this new provision of the AJCA. Other Matters The Company is a defendant in a number of other pending legal proceedings incidental to present and former operations, acquisitions and dispositions. The Company does not expect the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As new internal controls and procedures are implemented, any reported allegations or violations of our guide to ethical conduct are investigated and appropriate disciplinary and remedial measures are taken. An allegation was brought to our attention that during the period from 1999 through 2003 certain improper payments were made by a non U.S. subsidiary of Tyco with 2004 revenue of 54 $40 million. With the assistance of outside counsel, we conducted an internal investigation into these allegations and whether certain payments were correctly recorded in the books and records of the subsidiary. We have taken remedial steps and have reported the results of our investigation to the Department of Justice and the SEC and are cooperating with their inquiry. We do not believe this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Backlog At September 30, 2004, we had a backlog of unfilled orders of $13.2 billion, compared to a backlog of $11.3 billion at September 30, 2003. We expect that approximately 80% of our backlog at September 30, 2004 will be filled during 2005. Backlog by reportable industry segment at September 30 is as follows ($ in millions): 2004 2003(1) Fire and Security $ 6,726 $ 6,782 Engineered Products and Services 3,469 2,025 Electronics 2,454 2,025 Healthcare 280 297 Plastics and Adhesives 118 96 Corporate and Other 120 76 $ 13,167 $ 11,301 (1)During the first quarter of 2004, our Precision Interconnect business was transferred from Healthcare to Electronics. In addition, the results of the TGN business held for sale are presented within Corporate and Other. The Company has conformed its segment reporting accordingly and has reclassified comparative prior period information to reflect these changes. Within Fire and Security, backlog decreased primarily as a result of the sale of Sonitrol by ADT Security in the second quarter of 2004. Backlog for Fire and Security includes recurring revenue in force, which represents twelve months fees for monitoring and maintenance services under contract in the security business. The amount of recurring revenue in force at September 30, 2004 and September 30, 2003 was $3,559 million and $3,607 million, respectively. Within Engineered Products and Services, backlog increased primarily as a result of a $1.4 billion adjustment related to a change in how we classify sub contract costs that are paid by Infrastructure Services and re billed to their customers. These costs have historically been treated as "pass through" and were therefore not previously included in reported revenue and cost of revenue of Infrastructure Services. During 2004, the Company began reflecting these subcontract costs in both revenue and cost of revenue of Infrastructure Services. Within Electronics, backlog increased primarily due to stronger orders resulting from an overall improvement in business conditions across the vast majority of its end markets. Backlog in Healthcare and Plastics and Adhesives represents unfilled orders, which, in the nature of the businesses, are normally shipped shortly after purchase orders are received. We do not view backlog in Healthcare and Plastics and Adhesives to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity. 55   Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale of Accounts Receivable Tyco has several programs under which it may sell participating interests in accounts receivable to investors who, in turn, purchase and receive ownership and security interests in those receivables. As collections reduce accounts receivable included in the pool, the Company sells new receivables. The Company has the risk of credit loss on the receivables and, accordingly, the full amount of the reserve has been retained on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The proceeds from the sales were used to repay short term and long term borrowings and for working capital and other corporate purposes and are reported as operating cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The sale proceeds are less than the face amount of accounts receivable sold by an amount that approximates the cost that would be incurred if commercial paper were issued backed by these accounts receivable. The discount from the face amount is accounted for as a loss on the sale of receivables and has been included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Such discount aggregated $18 million, $29 million, and $17 million, or 3.1%, 3.5%, and 2.7% of the weighted average balance of the receivables outstanding, during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company retains collection and administrative responsibilities for the participating interests in the defined pool. During 2004, the Company reduced outstanding balances under its accounts receivable programs by $929 million, of which $812 million relates to three of its corporate accounts receivable programs. At September 30, 2004 and 2003, the availability under corporate programs was $625 million and $1,025 million, respectively. Subsequent to September 30, 2004, the Company further reduced the availability under these programs to $550 million. At September 30, 2004 and 2003, the amounts utilized under these programs was zero and $803 million, respectively. The remaining reduction related to certain of our international businesses selling fewer accounts receivable as a short term financing mechanism. These transactions qualify as true sales. The aggregate amount outstanding under these arrangements was $99 million and $202 million at September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Variable Interest Entities The Company has programs under which it sells machinery and equipment to investors who, in turn, purchase and receive ownership and security interests in those assets. As such, the Company may have certain investments in those affiliated companies whereby it provides varying degrees of financial support and where the investors are entitled to a share in the results of those entities but do not consolidate these entities. While these entities may be substantive operating companies, they have been evaluated for potential consolidation under FIN 46. As previously discussed, during 2003 the Company restructured one of the synthetic leases to meet the requirements of FIN 46 for off balance sheet accounting. In 2003 in conjunction with adopting FIN 46, the Company also evaluated other investments and concluded that four joint ventures that were previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting within Tyco Infrastructure Services, in which we own a minority interest, met the consolidation criteria set forth in FIN 46. Accordingly, these ventures were consolidated onto the Companys balance sheet effective July 1, 2003, and were subsequently deconsolidated as of March 31, 2004 upon the adoption of FIN 46R. The assets and liabilities of these joint ventures included in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2003 were $96 million and $69 million, respectively. Guarantees Certain of the Companys business segments have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from 2005 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance and the potential exposure for 56 nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In disposing of assets or businesses, the Company often provides representations, warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. The Company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, we have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows. The Company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item I. Business Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. The Company has guaranteed the fair value of certain vessels not to exceed $235 million, and as of September 30, 2004 expects the obligation to be $54 million, which is recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, based on its estimate of fair value of the vessels (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources Contractual Obligations" above). As a result of exiting certain facilities as part of restructuring and acquisition plans, or otherwise, the Company continues to lease certain properties which it has vacated but has sub let to third parties. In the event the third parties vacate the premises, the Company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements. The Company believes that the financial risk of default by sub lessors is not material, individually and in the aggregate, to the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company generally records estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. For further information on estimated product warranty, see Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 57  Accounting Pronouncements In November 2003, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03 1, "The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments." EITF 03 1 provides guidance on determining other than temporary impairments and its application to marketable equity securities and debt securities accounted for under SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") EITF Issue 03 1 1 which delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in the EITF 03 1 pending finalization of the draft FSP EITF Issue 03 1 a, "Implementation Guidance for the Application of Paragraph 16 of EITF 03 1." The disclosure requirements of EITF 03 1 remain in effect. The Company adopted the disclosure requirement of EITF 03 1 as of September 30, 2004. The adoption of the recognition and measurement provisions of EITF 03 1 are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46 (revised December 2003 as FIN 46R). FIN 46R further explains how to identify Variable Interest Entities ("VIE") and how to determine when a business enterprise should include the assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interest and results of VIE in its financial statements. The Company adopted FIN 46R as of March 31, 2004. As a result, the joint ventures that were previously consolidated under FIN 46 were deconsolidated effective March 31, 2004. See Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the impact of FIN 46R. In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to SFAS No. 132, "Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits," to improve financial statement disclosure for defined benefit plans. This statement requires additional disclosures about the assets (including plan assets by category), obligations and cash flows of defined pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans. It also requires reporting of various elements of pension and other postretirement benefit costs on a quarterly basis. Generally, the disclosure requirements are effective for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2003; however, information about foreign plans is effective for fiscal years ending after June 15, 2004. Tyco adopted the revised SFAS No. 132 during the quarter ended March 31, 2004. See Note 19 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of retirement plans. In December 2003, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 104, "Revenue Recognition," which supercedes SAB 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements." SAB 104s primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in SAB 101 related to multiple element revenue arrangements, superceded as a result of the issuance of EITF 00 21, "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables." The issuance of SAB 104 reflects the concepts contained in EITF 00 21. The other revenue recognition concepts contained in SAB 101 remain largely unchanged. The issuance of SAB 104 did not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In May 2004, the FASB issued FSP No. 106 2, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003." FSP No. 106 2 provides guidance on the accounting for the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the "Act") on postretirement health care plans that provide prescription drug benefits. FSP No. 106 2 also requires certain disclosures regarding the effect of the federal subsidy provided by the Act. FSP No. 106 2 is effective for Tyco in the fourth quarter of 2004. The adoption of FSP No. 106 2 did not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In September 2004, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 04 8 "The Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted Earnings per Share." This EITF requires that contingently convertible debt securities with a market price trigger be included in diluted earnings per share, regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met. EITF 04 8 is effective for all 58 periods ending after December 15, 2004 and requires retroactive restatement of previously reported earnings per share. Any contingently convertible instrument that is settled in cash before December 31, 2004 would not be reflected in the retroactive restatement. The adoption of this EITF is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4." SFAS No. 151 amends Accounting Research Bulletin ("ARB") No. 43, Chapter 4, to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials (spoilage) should be recognized as current period charges. In addition, SFAS No. 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No. 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company is currently assessing the impact that SFAS No. 151 will have on the results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 59   Risk Factors You should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our publicly traded securities. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as competition, technological obsolescence, labor relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations and our liquidity. Risks Relating to Actions of Tycos Former Senior Corporate Management Pending litigation could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition. As a result of actions taken by our former senior corporate management, Tyco, some members of our former senior corporate management, former members of our Board of Directors and our current Chief Executive Officer are named defendants in a number of purported class actions alleging violations of the disclosure provisions of the federal securities laws. Tyco, certain of our current and former employees, some members of our former senior corporate management and some former members of our Board of Directors also are named as defendants in several ERISA class actions. In addition, Tyco and some members of our former senior corporate management are subject to an SEC inquiry, and some members of our former senior corporate management are named as defendants in criminal cases being prosecuted by the District Attorney of New York County. The findings and outcomes of the prosecutions and the SEC civil action may affect the course of the purported securities class actions and ERISA class actions pending against Tyco. We are generally obligated to indemnify our directors and officers and our former directors and officers who are also named as defendants in some or all of these matters to the extent required by Bermuda law. In addition, our insurance carriers may decline coverage, or our coverage may be insufficient to cover our expenses and liability, in some or all of these matters. We are unable at this time to estimate what our ultimate liability in these matters may be, and it is possible that we will be required to pay judgments or settlements and incur expenses, in excess of any insurance coverage, in aggregate amounts that would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or probable losses, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters. Continued scrutiny resulting from ongoing governmental investigations may have an adverse effect on our business. We and others have received subpoenas and requests from the SECs Division of Enforcement, the District Attorney of New York County, the Department of Labor and others seeking the production of voluminous documents in connection with various investigations into our governance, management, operations, accounting and related controls. Certain current and former employees in Fire and Security received subpoenas from the SECs Division of Enforcement seeking testimony related to past accounting practices regarding the ADT dealer connect fees. As previously reported in our periodic filings, these practices have been discontinued. The Department of Labor is investigating Tyco and the administrators of certain of our benefit plans. We cannot predict when these investigations will be completed, nor can we predict what the results of these investigations may be. It is possible that we will be required to pay material fines, consent to injunctions on future conduct, lose the ability to conduct business with government instrumentalities (which in turn could negatively impact our business with non governmental customers) or suffer other penalties, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot provide assurance that the effects and results of these or other investigations will not be material and adverse to our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 60 Examinations and audits by tax authorities, including the IRS, could result in additional tax payments for prior periods. Tyco and our subsidiaries income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. Tyco is currently under audit by the IRS for the years 1997 to 2000. In connection with such examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax deficiencies. We are reviewing the issues raised by the tax authorities and are contesting certain of the proposed tax deficiencies. Amounts related to these tax deficiencies and other tax contingencies that management has assessed as probable and estimable have been accrued through the income tax provision. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. In connection with the IRS audits for the years 1997 2000, the Company prepared proposed adjustments to these prior period U.S. federal income tax returns. The proposed amendments are currently being reviewed by the IRS and if accepted will result in receipt of refunds or credits and a corresponding reduction to our deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company may prepare proposed amendments to prior period U.S. federal income tax returns for additional periods. Ongoing SEC inquiries may require us to further amend or restate our public disclosures. We are subject to inquiries by the SECs Division of Enforcement. We cannot provide assurance that the resolution of the Division of Enforcements inquiries will not necessitate further amendments or restatements to our previously filed periodic reports or lead to some enforcement proceedings against Tyco. The SECs Division of Enforcement has not completed its review of prior managements actions and our accounting, including the matters covered by the Companys Current Report on Form 8 K filed on December 30, 2002. Further instances of breakdowns in our internal controls and procedures could have an adverse effect on us. Management has determined that, in the past, Tyco in general suffered from: poor documentation; inadequate policies and procedures to prevent the misconduct of senior corporate executives; inadequate procedures for proper corporate authorizations; inadequate approval procedures and documentation; a lack of oversight by senior management at the corporate level; a pattern of using aggressive accounting that, even when in accordance with GAAP, was intended to increase reported earnings above what they would have been if more conservative accounting had been employed; pressure on, and inducements to, segment and unit managers to increase current earnings, including decisions as to what accounting treatment to employ; and a lack of a stated and demonstrable commitment by former senior corporate management to set high standards of ethics, integrity, accounting, and corporate governance. 61 While we have implemented new procedures, we cannot provide assurance that we will not discover that there have been further instances of breakdowns in our internal controls and procedures. Material adverse legal judgments, fines, penalties or settlements could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness. We estimate that our available cash and our cash flow from operations will be adequate to fund our operations and service our debt for the forseeable future. In making this estimate, we have not assumed the need to make any material payments in connection with our pending litigation or investigations. Any material adverse legal judgments, fines, penalties or settlements arising from our pending investigations and litigation could require additional funding. If such developments require us to obtain additional funding, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain the additional funding that we need on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Such an outcome could have important consequences to you. For example, it could: require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes, including debt reduction or dividend payments; increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate; restrict our ability to introduce new technologies or exploit business opportunities; make it more difficult for us to satisfy our payment obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness; and increase the difficulty and or cost to us of refinancing our indebtedness. Additional negative publicity may adversely affect our business. As a result of actions taken by our former senior corporate management, Tyco was the subject of continuing negative publicity focusing on these actions. This negative publicity contributed to significant declines in the prices of our publicly traded securities in 2002 and brought increased regulatory scrutiny upon us. Additional negative publicity related to former senior corporate managements actions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows and the market price of our publicly traded securities. Our senior corporate management team is required to devote significant attention to matters arising from actions of prior management. We replaced our senior corporate executives with a new team during 2002 through 2004, and all of the former members of our Board of Directors determined not to stand for reelection in March 2003. A new Board of Directors was elected at our annual general meeting of shareholders in March 2003. We cannot provide assurance that this major restructuring of our Board of Directors and senior management team, and the accompanying distractions related to matters arising from the actions of prior management will not adversely affect our results of operations. 62 Risks Relating to Our Businesses Cyclical industry and economic conditions have affected and may continue to adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our operating results in some of our segments are affected adversely by the general cyclical pattern of the industries in which they operate. For example, demand for the products and services of Fire and Security and Engineered Products and Services is significantly affected by levels of commercial construction and consumer and business discretionary spending. Also, the electronic components business within Electronics is heavily dependent on the end markets it serves and therefore can be affected by the demand and capital investment patterns of these markets, which could impact the margins in this business. This cyclical impact can be amplified because some of our businesses purchase products from other of our businesses. For example, Fire and Security purchases certain products sold by Engineered Products and Services. Therefore, a drop in demand for our fire prevention products due to lower new residential or office construction or other factors can cause a drop in demand for certain of our products sold by Engineered Products and Services. Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities, litigation and violations. We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing, among other things: the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials; emissions or discharges of substances into the environment; and the health and safety of our employees. There can be no assurances that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with environmental and health and safety laws. If we violate these laws, we could be fined, criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. For example, on August 17, 2004, one of our subsidiaries in Electronics was sentenced for Clean Water Act violations at three of its manufacturing plants in Connecticut, pursuant to which it paid a $6 million fine and an additional $4 million to fund environmental projects designed to improve the environment for local residents. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings Environmental Litigation. Certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances and costs to restore natural resources. In addition to cleanup costs resulting from environmental laws, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances used, stored or disposed of by us or contained in our products. We have been notified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, certain foreign and state environmental agencies, and some third parties that conditions at a number of sites where we and others disposed of hazardous substances require cleanup and other possible remedial action and may require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the cost of cleanup of those sites and or for natural resource damages. We also have a number of projects underway at several of our current and former manufacturing facilities in order to comply with environmental laws or otherwise remediate environmental contamination. These projects relate to a variety of activities, including: radioactive materials decontamination and decommissioning; solvent, metal and other hazardous substance contamination cleanup; and oil spill equipment upgrades and replacement. 63 These projects, some of which are voluntary and some of which are required under applicable law, involve both remediation expenses and capital improvements. In addition, we remain responsible for certain environmental issues at manufacturing locations previously sold by us. The ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods. We have concluded that it is probable that we would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately $167 million to $443 million. We concluded that the best estimate within this range is approximately $265 million, of which $42 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and $223 million is included in other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2004. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. While we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with such laws, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations or that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past, present or future business activities. We may be required to recognize additional impairment charges. Pursuant to GAAP, we are required to periodically assess our goodwill, intangibles and other long lived assets to determine if they are impaired. Disruptions to our business, end market conditions and protracted economic weakness, unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units, divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in additional charges to goodwill and other asset impairments. Future impairment charges could substantially affect our reported earnings in the period of such charge. In addition, such charges would reduce our consolidated net worth and our shareholders equity, increasing our debt to total capitalization ratio. Such reduction in consolidated net worth and increase in debt as a percentage of total capitalization could result in a default under our credit facilities. Foreign currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results. We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Our net revenue derived from sales in non U.S. markets for 2004, 2003 and 2002 were 47.4%, 45.0% and 41.8%, respectively, and we expect revenue from non U.S. markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenue. Therefore, when the U.S. Dollar strengthens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries where we sell our products, such as the Euro, our U.S. Dollar reported revenue and income will decrease. changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and may, in some instances, have a significant effect on our results of operations. Our financial statements reflect recalculations of items denominated in non U.S. currencies to U.S. Dollars, our functional currency. We are a large buyer of steel and resin in the United States. We are also a large buyer of other commodities, including copper, brass, gold, paper, pulp and cotton. Volatility in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services. We may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers and this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. 64 We monitor these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program. In some cases, we purchase hedges or enter into contracts to insulate our results of operations from these fluctuations. Nevertheless, changes in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates may have a material adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to a significant amount of litigation, including litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights, litigation alleging anti competitive behavior and product liability litigation. In certain circumstances, patent infringement and anti trust laws permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages. In addition, our Healthcare business is subject to regulation and potential litigation. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our managements attention, and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, that could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our Healthcare business is subject to extensive regulation by the government and failure to comply with those regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulates the approval, manufacturing and sale and marketing of many of our healthcare products. Failure to comply with current Good Manufacturing Practices and other applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead to temporary manufacturing shutdowns, product shortages or delays in product manufacturing. Efficacy or safety concerns, an increase in trends of adverse events in the marketplace, and or manufacturing quality issues with respect to our products could lead to product recalls, withdrawals or declining sales. Our ADT business has generally experienced higher rates of customer attrition, which may reduce our future revenue and has caused us to change the useful life of accounts, increasing our depreciation and amortization expense. Attrition rates for customers in our global electronic security services business were 15.1%, 15.9% and 13.2% on a trailing 12 month basis as of September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. If attrition rates show an upward trend, ADTs recurring revenue and results of operations will be adversely affected. Tyco amortizes the costs of ADTs contracts and related customer relationships purchased through the ADT dealer program using a double declining balance method based on a ten year life for the first eight years of the estimated life of the customer relationships, converting to the straight line method of amortization to completely amortize the asset pool by the end of the twelfth year. Internally generated residential and commercial account pools are amortized using a straight line method over ten to fourteen years. If the attrition rates were to rise for these account pools, then Tyco may be required to accelerate the amortization of the costs related to these pools, which could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our reputation and our ability to do business may be impaired by reckless or corrupt behavior by any of our employees or agents or those of our subsidiaries. Tyco and its subsidiaries operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, including, but not limited to, Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. Tycos policy mandates strict compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as amended, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials. Nonetheless, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or 65 criminal acts committed by our employees that would violate the U.S. and or foreign laws governing payments to government officials. These actions could result in criminal or civil penalties, including substantial monetary fines, against us or our subsidiaries and could damage our reputation and, therefore, our ability to do business. An allegation was brought to our attention that during the period from 1999 through 2003 certain improper payments were made by a non U.S. subsidiary of Tyco with 2004 revenue of $40 million. With the assistance of outside counsel, we conducted an internal investigation into these allegations and whether certain payments were correctly recorded in the books and records of the subsidiary. We have taken remedial steps and have reported the results of our investigation to the Department of Justice and the SEC and are cooperating with their inquiry. Covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us. Our bank credit agreements contain financial covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and minimum levels of net worth, and other covenants that limit our ability to pledge assets and to make substantial payments in connection with our capital shares. We have synthetic lease facilities with other covenants, including interest coverage and leverage ratios. Our outstanding indentures contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges, subsidiary debt and sale/leaseback transactions. Although we believe none of these covenants are presently restrictive to our operations, our ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot provide assurance that we will meet those tests. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreements or indentures. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our credit facilities or indentures, the lenders or trustees could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If the lenders or trustees accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our credit facilities and our other indebtedness. Acceleration of any obligation under any of our material debt instruments will permit the holders of our other material debt to accelerate their obligations. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources. Downgrades of our debt ratings would adversely affect us. Certain downgrades by Moodys and S&P would permit the providers of our receivables facilities, to the extent that our receivables facilities are utilized, to cease further purchases under the facilities and would increase the interest cost of our credit facility borrowings. Downgrades may also increase our cost of capital and make it more difficult for us to obtain new financing. Risks Relating to Our Jurisdiction of Incorporation Legislation and negative publicity regarding Bermuda companies could increase our tax burden and affect our operating results. Legislation Relating to Government Contracts We continue to assess the potential impact of various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals that would deny government contracts to U.S. companies that move their corporate location abroad. The legislative proposals could cover the 1997 acquisition of Tyco International Ltd., a Massachusetts corporation, by ADT Limited (a public company that had been located in Bermuda since the 1980s with origins dating back to the United Kingdom since the early 1900s), as a result of which ADT changed its name to Tyco International Ltd. and became the parent to the Tyco group. 66 In 2003, the State of California adopted legislation intended to limit the eligibility of certain Bermuda and other foreign chartered companies to participate in certain state contracts. To date Tyco companies have requested waivers which have been granted or are still pending with only one request having been denied. However, there is no reliable process for how that waiver authority will be exercised and how the provision for such waivers will affect Tycos business. In addition, the U.S. federal government and various other states and municipalities have proposed or may propose legislation that would deny government contracts to U.S. companies that move their corporate location abroad. We are unable to predict with any level of certainty the likelihood or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law, the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments, or the impact such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business. Tycos revenues related to direct sales to the U.S. federal government and the State of California accounted for less than 2.0% and 0.1%, respectively, of our total net revenues for 2004. We are unable to predict, however, whether the final form of the proposed legislation discussed above would also affect Tycos indirect sales to the U.S. federal or state governments or the willingness of Tycos non governmental customers to do business with us. As a result of these uncertainties, we are unable to assess the potential impact on us of any proposed legislation in this area and can provide no assurance that the impact will not be materially adverse. Tax Legislation The U.S. Congress has in the past considered legislation affecting the tax treatment of U.S. companies that have undertaken certain types of expatriation transactions. Recently, the U.S. Congress enacted such legislation, which did not, however, retroactively apply to the 1997 acquisition of Tyco International Ltd. by ADT Limited. We expect various tax proposals to be introduced in the U.S. Congress in the future and cannot provide assurance that these proposals would not have adverse effects on Tyco if enacted. Such adverse effects could include substantially reducing the tax benefits of our corporate structure, materially increasing our tax burden or otherwise adversely affecting our business. Negative Publicity There is continuing negative publicity regarding, and criticism of, U.S. companies use of, or relocation to, offshore jurisdictions, including Bermuda. As a Bermuda company, this negative publicity could harm our reputation and impair our ability to generate new business if companies or government agencies decline to do business with us as a result of the negative public image of Bermuda companies or the possibility of our customers receiving negative media attention from doing business with a Bermuda company. Bermuda law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of our securities. We are organized under the laws of Bermuda. It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the United States against us in Bermuda based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some doubt as to whether the courts of Bermuda would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the United States and Bermuda do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any 67 U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Bermuda. As a Bermuda company, Tyco is governed by the Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda, which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to United States corporations and shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to interested director and officer transactions, shareholder lawsuits and indemnification. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of a Bermuda company are generally owed to the company only. Shareholders of Bermuda companies do not generally have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may only exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company in limited circumstances. Under Bermuda law, a company may also agree to indemnify directors and officers for any personal liability, not involving fraud or dishonesty, incurred in relation to the company. Thus, holders of Tyco securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States.  Forward Looking Information Certain statements in this report are "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. All statements contained herein that are not clearly historical in nature are forward looking, and the words "anticipate," "believe," "expect," "estimate," "project" and similar expressions are generally intended to identify forward looking statements. Any forward looking statement contained herein, in press releases, written statements or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or in Tycos communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls and conference calls, regarding expectations with respect to sales, earnings, cash flows, operating efficiencies, product expansion, backlog, the consummation and benefits of acquisitions and divestitures or other matters, as well as financings and repurchases of debt or equity securities, are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and contingencies. Many of these risks, uncertainties and contingencies are beyond our control, and may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from anticipated results, performance or achievements. Factors that might affect such forward looking statements include, among other things: overall economic and business conditions; the demand for Tycos goods and services; competitive factors in the industries in which Tyco competes; changes in tax requirements (including tax rate changes, new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations); results and consequences of Tycos internal investigation and governmental investigations concerning the Companys governance, management, internal controls and operations; the outcome of litigation and governmental proceedings as a result of actions taken by our former senior corporate management; the ratings on our debt and our ability to repay or refinance our outstanding indebtedness as it matures; our ability to operate within the limitations imposed by financing arrangements and to maintain our credit ratings; interest rate fluctuations and other changes in borrowing costs; other capital market conditions, including foreign currency rate fluctuations; 68 fluctuations in the prices of commodities, including steel and resin; economic and political conditions in international markets, including governmental changes and restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders; the ability to achieve cost savings in connection with the Companys strategic restructuring and Six Sigma initiatives; potential further impairment of our goodwill; the impact of fluctuations in the share price of Tyco common shares; changes in U.S. and non U.S. government regulations in general, and in particular changes in rules and regulations regarding the safety, efficacy, sales, promotions, insurance reimbursement and pricing of Tycos disposable medical products and other specialty products, and regarding Tycos ability to operate and set prices with respect to its undersea cable communications systems; the possible effects on Tyco of future legislation in the U.S. that may limit or eliminate potential U.S. tax benefits resulting from Tycos incorporation in Bermuda or deny U.S. government contracts to Tyco based upon its incorporation in Bermuda; and the potential distraction costs associated with negative publicity relating to actions of our former senior corporate management. 69   Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are subject to market risk associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. In order to manage the volatility relating to our more significant market risks, we enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts, cross currency swaps, foreign currency options, and interest rate swaps. We do not anticipate any material changes in our primary market risk exposures in 2005. We utilize established risk management policies and procedures in executing derivative financial instrument transactions. We do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Derivative financial instruments related to interest rate sensitivity of debt obligations, intercompany cross border transactions and anticipated non functional currency cash flows, are used with the goal of mitigating a significant portion of these exposures when it is cost effective to do so. Counterparties to derivative financial instruments are limited to financial institutions with at least an A/A2 long term debt rating. Interest Rate Sensitivity The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, including debt obligations and interest rate swaps. For debt obligations, the table presents cash flows of principal repayment and weighted average interest rates. For interest rate and cross currency swaps, the table presents notional amounts at the current market price rate and weighted average interest rates. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract.

These contracts primarily related to exposures against the Euro.
