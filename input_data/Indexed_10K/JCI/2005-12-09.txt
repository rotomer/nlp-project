Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the Selected Financial Data and our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements due to many factors, including but not limited to those under the headings "Risk Factors" and "Forward Looking Information." Introduction The Consolidated Financial Statements include the consolidated accounts of Tyco International Ltd., a company organized under the laws of Bermuda, and its subsidiaries (hereinafter collectively referred to as "we," the "Company" or "Tyco") and have been prepared in United States dollars, and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Company operates in the following business segments: Fire and Security designs, manufactures, installs, monitors and services electronic security and fire protection systems; Electronics designs, manufactures and distributes electrical and electronic components; Healthcare designs, manufactures and distributes medical devices and supplies, imaging agents, pharmaceuticals and adult incontinence and infant care products; and Engineered Products and Services designs, manufactures, distributes and services engineered products, including industrial valves and controls, as well as steel tubular goods, and provides environmental and other industrial consulting services. Unless otherwise indicated, references in this Annual Report to 2005, 2004 and 2003 are to Tycos fiscal years ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Overview Our business strategy focuses on enhancing internal growth and operational efficiency for existing Tyco businesses. We achieve this goal primarily through new product innovation, increased market share, and continued geographic expansion. We have implemented and will continue to implement additional Six Sigma initiatives across our business segments to achieve best in class operating practices. The Company has engaged in a series of restructuring programs since November 2003 through which we have made our operations more efficient, including exiting certain non core businesses or business lines and streamlining general operations. The impact of these restructuring programs on the Companys operations is discussed in "Operating Results" and "Segment Results." Also, during the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company committed to a plan to sell its Plastics and Adhesives segment. As such, the operations of our Plastics and Adhesives segment are reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Details related to the Companys divestiture program and the related discontinued operations are discussed in "Divestitures and Discontinued Operations." We are continuing to assess the strategic fit of our various businesses and are considering additional divestitures where businesses do not align with our long term vision. In 2005, we continued to utilize cash to fund internal growth, strengthen the balance sheet and return capital to shareholders. During 2005, we utilized $3.0 billion to repurchase our convertible debentures prior to their scheduled maturities. In total, these repurchases reduced our diluted share count by approximately 88.9 million shares on an annualized basis with the added benefit of reducing our debt and interest expense. In addition, we utilized $2.0 billion in cash for scheduled repayments of debentures. Also, in July 2005, Tycos Board of Directors approved a $1.5 billion share repurchase 34 program. As of September 30, 2005, we have repurchased 10.5 million of our common shares for $300 million. In the two weeks following the end of the fourth quarter of 2005, we have repurchased an additional 7.9 million of our common shares for $216 million. As a result of this program, we anticipate spending a total of approximately $2 billion through the second quarter of 2006 for these repurchases. During the first quarter of 2005, we announced a substantial increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.0125 per share to $0.10 per share. As a result, dividend payments for 2005 increased to $628 million from $100 million in the comparable prior year period. References to Tyco are to the Companys continuing operations. Prior year amounts have been reclassified to exclude the results of discontinued operations and to comparatively reflect changes in the Companys segment reporting. The operating results of the TGN are presented within Corporate and Other through the date of its disposal in the third quarter of 2005. Information for 2003 has been reclassified to reflect the transfer of Tycos Precision Interconnect business from Healthcare to Electronics in 2004. Operating Results The following table details net revenue and earnings for the years ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 ($ in millions): 2005 2004 2003 Revenue from product sales $ 31,955 $ 30,337 $ 27,114 Service revenue 7,772 8,074 7,142 Net revenue $ 39,727 $ 38,411 $ 34,256 Operating income $ 5,795 $ 5,236 $ 2,877 Interest income 123 91 107 Interest expense (815 ) (956 ) (1,147 ) Other expense, net (911 ) (286 ) (223 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest 4,192 4,085 1,614 Income taxes (984 ) (1,123 ) (729 ) Minority interest (9 ) (14 ) (3 ) Income from continuing operations 3,199 2,948 882 (Loss) income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes (188 ) (69 ) 173 Income before cumulative effect of accounting change 3,011 2,879 1,055 Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of income taxes 21 (75 ) Net income $ 3,032 $ 2,879 $ 980 Net revenue increased $1.3 billion, or 3.4%, for 2005 as compared to 2004, which resulted from growth in all segments.

Operating income increased $559 million, or 10.7%, for 2005 while operating margin increased 1.0 percentage point to 14.6%. 2005 was favorably impacted by the gain on the sale of the TGN business ($303 million). In addition, the year was unfavorably impacted by charges related to an adverse decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on a patent dispute in the Healthcare segment ($277 million), a charge related to an SEC enforcement action of $50 million and a charge relating to former executives employment of $70 million. Foreign currency exchange rates favorably affected operating income by $142 million. 35 Net revenue increased $4.2 billion, or 12.1%, for 2004 as compared to 2003, which resulted from growth in all segments. Foreign currency exchange rates favorably affected the period by $1.7 billion while the impact of divestitures negatively impacted the period by $638 million. Operating income increased $2.4 billion, or 82.0%, for 2004 while operating margin increased 5.2 percentage points to 13.6%. Operating income for 2004 was unfavorably impacted by charges of $380 million, consisting of the following: (i) net restructuring and other charges of $212 million, of which charges of $6 million are included in cost of sales; (ii) net losses and impairments on divestitures totaling $116 million; and (iii) charges for the impairment of long lived assets of $52 million, of which $34 million is attributable to machinery and equipment impairments at Fire and Security. Foreign currency exchange rates favorably affected operating income by $230 million. Operating income for 2003 was unfavorably impacted by net charges totaling $1,625 million. These charges consisted of: (i) charges for the impairment of long lived assets of $815 million; (ii) charges recorded for changes in estimates of $298 million which arose from the Companys intensified internal audits and detailed controls and operating reviews (includes net restructuring credits of $72 million, of which credits of $13 million are included in costs of sales, charges for the impairment of long lived assets of $10 million, charges of $240 million included in selling, general and administrative expenses, and charges of $120 million included in cost of sales); (iii) charges for the impairment of goodwill of $278 million; (iv) other charges of $154 million, of which $34 million is included in cost of sales related primarily to product warranty reserves and the dismantlement of customers ADT security systems, and $120 million is included in selling, general and administrative expenses related primarily to uncollectible accounts receivable, internal investigation fees, as well as severance and facility closures, slightly offset by a credit for changes in estimates of charges recorded in prior periods; (v) a charge of $91 million for a retroactive, incremental premium on prior period directors and officers insurance included in selling, general and administrative expenses; and (vi) net restructuring credits of $11 million, of which charges of $2 million are included in cost of sales. Foreign currency exchange rates favorably affected operating income by $191 million. Results by Geographic Area Net revenue by geographic area for the years ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is as follows ($ in millions): 2005 2004 2003 Net revenue: United States $ 19,635 $ 19,632 $ 18,309 Other Americas 2,202 2,103 1,786 Europe 11,476 10,892 9,256 Asia Pacific 6,414 5,784 4,905 Net revenue(1) $ 39,727 $ 38,411 $ 34,256 (1)Revenue from external customers is attributed to individual countries based on the reporting entity that records the transaction. Segment Results The segment discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in results for each continuing segment. Divestitures have impacted certain of our segments since the establishment of our divestiture program in early 2004. See further details in "Divestitures and Discontinued Operations" and "Acquisitions" below. 36 Fire and Security The following table sets forth net revenue and operating income and margin for Fire and Security for the years ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 ($ in millions): 2005 2004 2003 Revenue from product sales $ 5,299 $ 5,343 $ 4,894 Service revenue 6,204 6,104 5,938 Net revenue $ 11,503 $ 11,447 $ 10,832 Operating income $ 1,216 $ 899 $ 342 Operating margin 10.6 % 7.9 % 3.2 % Net revenue for Fire and Security remained relatively level during 2005 as compared to 2004 as the decrease in product revenue was offset by an increase in service revenue. Revenue from product sales includes sales and installation of security, fire protection and other systems. Net revenue increased due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates ($274 million) and, to a lesser extent, increased sales volume of breathing and intrusion products at Tyco Safety Products as well as growth in our European fire services business. These increases were offset by the impact of divestitures ($315 million) and decreased sales at our security business in Europe. Operating income increased $317 million in 2005 over the prior year. Results for the current period included net restructuring related charges of $9 million as compared to net restructuring, impairment and divestiture charges of $264 million in 2004. Operating income for 2005 was also favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rates ($26 million) as well as cost savings related to operational excellence initiatives and prior year restructuring programs. These cost reductions were partially offset by increased investment in sales and marketing. In addition, 2005 was unfavorably impacted by $18 million of divestiture related charges. Attrition rates for customers in our Global Electronic Security Services business decreased to an average of 14.8% on a trailing twelve month basis for 2005, as compared to 15.1% for 2004 and 15.9% in 2003. Net revenue for Fire and Security increased 5.7% in 2004 as compared to 2003, including a 9.2% increase in product revenue and a 2.8% increase in service revenue. The increase in net revenue was primarily due to favorable currency exchange rates ($526 million) slightly offset by the effects of divestitures ($82 million). To a lesser extent, the increase in net revenue was due to stronger sales to retailers within worldwide security and higher sales volume of breathing systems and video and access control product at Tyco Safety Products. This increase was partially offset by weakness in the worldwide fire service business and Continental Europe Security. Operating income and margin increased significantly in 2004 as compared in 2003 due partially to total charges of $512 million which were recorded during 2003, discussed below. Additionally, the increase in operating income and margin was due to improvements within worldwide security related primarily to the combined impact of a stronger retailer market environment and cost reductions. Also contributing to the increase, to a lesser extent, were improvements within Continental Europe Security as a result of cost saving initiatives and a changing business model and Tyco Safety Products due primarily to increased volumes. The cost savings partly reflect the benefits of the restructuring activities described below. Operating income for 2004 also includes charges totaling $264 million, consisting primarily of restructuring ($175 million, of which $4 million is included in cost of sales), impairment ($34 million) and divestiture ($55 million) charges, substantially all of which are associated with the comprehensive cost reduction measures that began during 2003. Operating income and margin in 2003 included charges totaling $512 million. Included within the $512 million are charges of $266 million (includes charges of $128 million primarily related to 37 adjustments to liabilities such as workers compensation, professional fees, and environmental exposure, a charge of $98 million primarily due to adjusting allowances for doubtful accounts and slow and non moving inventory, as well as a write off of subscriber systems, charges of $34 million for other adjustments primarily related to deferred commissions, and charges of $6 million related to reconciling items) recorded in connection with the Companys intensified internal audits, detailed controls and operating reviews performed during the year. Also included within the $512 million are impairment charges of $143 million primarily related to the impairment of intangible assets associated with the ADT dealer program mostly as a result of increased attrition rates, and to the impairment of property, plant and equipment of subscriber systems and other fixed assets; net restructuring and other charges of $10 million, of which charges of $4 million are included in cost of sales and $3 million is for the write off of non current assets, related to streamlining the business; and other charges of $93 million, of which $34 million is included in cost of sales and $59 million is included in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily related to uncollectible receivables, product warranty and the dismantlement of customers ADT security systems. Included within the $143 million impairment charge and the $10 million net restructuring charge is a charge of $10 million and a credit of $2 million, respectively, also related to changes in estimates recorded during the quarter ended March 31, 2003. Electronics The following table sets forth net revenue and operating income and margin for Electronics for the years ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 ($ in millions): 2005 2004 2003 Revenue from product sales $ 12,042 $ 11,372 $ 10,052 Service revenue 154 450 440 Net revenue $ 12,196 $ 11,822 $ 10,492 Operating income $ 1,852 $ 1,749 $ 1,241 Operating margin 15.2 % 14.8 % 11.8 % Net revenue for Electronics increased $374 million or 3.2% in 2005 as compared to 2004, including a 5.9% increase in product revenue. The increase in net revenue was driven primarily by sales to the automotive, aerospace and defense, consumer electronics, power utilities, communications equipment manufacturing, and communication service markets. In addition, revenue increased substantially due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates ($294 million). These increases were partially offset by the impact of the divestiture of the Electrical Contracting Services business ($353 million). Operating income and operating margin for 2005 increased as compared to 2004 due primarily to increased sales volume, cost savings initiatives and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates ($57 million). These increases were partially offset by an 80 basis point impact of increased commodity costs. Additionally, operating income for 2005 included net restructuring and other credits of $5 million, as compared to net restructuring, divestiture and impairment charges of $22 million in 2004, discussed below. Net revenue for Electronics increased 12.7% in 2004 as compared to 2003, including a 13.1% increase in product revenue and a 2.3% increase in service revenue. The increase in net revenue was primarily a result of growth in existing businesses, specifically, the automotive, computer, consumer electronics, communications and industrial and commercial markets. This growth was partially offset by a decrease in sales of Power Systems products in North America and in our Electrical Contracting Services, which was divested in September 2004. Additionally, favorable changes in foreign currency rates ($560 million) contributed to the increase in net revenue. 38 The 40.9% increase in operating income and the 3.0 percentage point increase in margin in 2004 as compared to 2003 were primarily due to the revenue growth discussed above, cost savings initiatives that were executed in 2003, the positive impact of foreign currency ($90 million) and fewer charges recorded in 2004 as compared to 2003. These increases in operating income were partially offset by an 80 basis point impact of increased metal prices for copper and gold. Operating income for 2004 includes net restructuring, divestiture and impairment charges totaling $22 million. These net charges include a $52 million charge related to the divestiture of the Electrical Contracting Services business, partially offset by $33 million of net restructuring credits related to changes in estimates of severance, facility exit costs, distributor and supplier cancellation fees recorded in prior periods and the impact of the sale of assets that were impaired in prior years for amounts greater than originally anticipated. These net charges also include a $3 million charge related to the impairment of property, plant, and equipment. Operating income and margin for 2003 include net charges totaling $236 million. The $236 million consists primarily of charges for the impairment of goodwill of $278 million in Power Systems, Electrical Contracting Services and the Printed Circuit Group, restructuring credits of $72 million, of which $20 million is included in cost of sales, related primarily to changes in estimates of severance and facility exit costs recorded in prior years and charges for the impairment of long lived assets of $1 million. The net restructuring credit of $72 million includes $55 million of credits, which were changes in estimates recorded in connection with the Companys intensified internal audits and detailed controls and operating reviews performed during 2003. Also included within the $236 million are charges of $14 million related to adjusting asset reserves, $6 million related to the adjustments to accrual balances, and $9 million of reconciliation and other accounting adjustments, which were also recorded in connection with the Companys intensified internal audits and detailed controls and operating reviews performed during 2003. Healthcare The following table sets forth net revenue and operating income and margin for Healthcare for the years ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 ($ in millions): 2005 2004 2003 Revenue from product sales $ 9,477 $ 9,040 $ 8,344 Service revenue 66 70 76 Net revenue $ 9,543 $ 9,110 $ 8,420 Operating income $ 2,286 $ 2,365 $ 2,104 Operating margin 24.0 % 26.0 % 25.0 % Net revenue for Healthcare increased $433 million or 4.8% in 2005 as compared to 2004. This increase resulted primarily from growth in existing businesses and, to a lesser extent, favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates ($141 million). Growth in Healthcares underlying businesses was principally driven by increased revenue within Medical Devices & Supplies which was largely the result of increased sales volume in the International division, primarily in Europe, due to a salesforce investment and sales growth in vessel sealing, laparoscopy, and stapling. Increased sales at the Surgical division within Medical Devices & Supplies also strongly contributed, due to enhanced contracting with group purchasing organizations, increased acceptance of Laparoscopic Gastric By Pass procedures and increased adoption of LigaSure device. Pharmaceuticals also contributed to the increase in revenue, although to a lesser extent. These increases were partially offset by decreased sales in Retail primarily due to a difficult competitive environment and customer consolidations. 39  The decreases in operating income and operating margin in 2005 as compared to 2004 were due primarily to a $277 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005, associated with the adverse decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on a previously disclosed legal matter. (Refer to Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.) This charge, combined with declines in the Retail division as a result of the competitive environment mentioned above as well as increased material and transportation costs, was offset by substantial increases from other divisions, specifically the International and Surgical divisions within Medical Devices & Supplies as well as within Pharmaceutical. Increases in these divisions were due to strong sales growth as mentioned above, combined with a favorable product mix. Also positively impacting the segment were reduced administrative expenses at the segment level, as well as favorable foreign exchange rates ($41 million). In November of 2005, the Mallinckrodt Imaging Division voluntarily recalled two medical imaging products from the market. In each instance, Healthcare was concerned with the procedures that were being used to assure the sterility of each product. Healthcare has not received any reports of adverse events involving patient health or safety with regard to either product. Healthcares Mallinckrodt Imaging Division will not restart the manufacture of the products until all corrective actions have been implemented. Healthcare does not expect that the voluntary recall of these two products in November of 2005 will have a material adverse impact on the Company. Net revenue for Healthcare increased 8.2% in 2004 as compared to 2003. The increase in net revenue resulted primarily from growth in existing businesses as well as favorable foreign currency exchange rates ($292 million). Growth in Healthcares underlying businesses was primarily a result of increased net revenue within Medical Devices & Supplies, and to a lesser extent, at Pharmaceuticals. The increase at Medical Devices & Supplies was largely driven by higher sales volume within our International division, particularly in Europe, due to benefits realized from the sales force investment, back order recovery, growth in Spain and Italy and the absence of an unfavorable $47 million contractual adjustment recorded in 2003. Also contributing to the increase in Medical Devices & Supplies were higher sales within the Medical division resulting primarily from new SharpSafety product launches and gain in market share within the wound care market. The 12.4% increase in operating income in 2004 as compared to 2003 was due primarily to the favorable margin impact of the increased sales discussed above, favorable foreign currency exchanges rates and a continued focus on maximizing operating efficiencies. Operating income was adversely impacted by a $29 million increase in legal liabilities for an ongoing patent infringement suit, and a $59 million increase in research and development costs. Additionally, operating income for 2004 includes net restructuring, divestitures and impairment charges of $18 million, composed of: (i) restructuring charges of $13 million related to the closure of various facilities offset by a credit of $2 million due to costs being less than anticipated; (ii) a $4 million divestiture charge resulting from a loss on the sale of a business and (iii) $3 million of impairment charges related to the closure of various facilities. During 2003, Healthcare recorded net credits totaling $2 million, including restructuring credits of $8 million due to actual costs being less than anticipated, and a credit of $7 million related to an insurance reimbursement for certain legal fees associated with product liability cases. These credits were largely offset by charges of $12 million related to asset reserves for inventory and charges of $1 million for adjustments to accrual balances related to workers compensation, which were changes in estimates recorded in connection with the Companys intensified internal audits, detailed controls and operating reviews and as a result of applying managements judgments and estimates. 40 Engineered Products and Services The following table sets forth net revenue and operating income and margin for Engineered Products and Services for the years ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 ($ in millions): 2005 2004 2003 Revenue from product sales $ 5,137 $ 4,582 $ 3,824 Service revenue 1,319 1,425 674 Net revenue $ 6,456 $ 6,007 $ 4,498 Operating income $ 672 $ 620 $ 362 Operating margin 10.4 % 10.3 % 8.0 % Net revenue for Engineered Products and Services increased $449 million or 7.5% in 2005 as compared to 2004. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by increased selling prices in Electrical and Metal Products due to higher costs of steel and other raw materials. In addition, Flow Control and, to a lesser extent, Tyco Fire & Building Products experienced growth in the industrial and commercial construction markets. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates ($167 million) also contributed to the increase in revenue. The above increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease at Infrastructure Services as a result of a strategic decision to be more selective in bidding for new projects, which will result in fewer but more profitable projects. The increases in operating income and operating margin in 2005 as compared to 2004 were due primarily to increased volume and demand within the industrial and commercial markets, along with the impact of operational excellence initiatives, cost reductions from prior period restructuring programs and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates ($21 million). These increases more than offset the impact of higher raw material costs. Additionally, 2005 operating income includes $1 million of a divestiture credit and $5 million of restructuring charges as compared to the $62 million of net restructuring impairment and divestiture charges in 2004 discussed below. Net revenue for Engineered Products and Services increased $1,509 million or 33.5% in 2004 as compared to 2003, of which $739 million, or 16.4%, represents a change in how we classify certain sub contract and other costs that are paid by Infrastructure Services and re billed to their customers. These costs were historically treated as "pass through" and were therefore not included in reported revenue and cost of revenue and Infrastructure Services. For the year ended September 30, 2004, the company began reflecting these sub contracts costs in both revenue and cost of revenue of Infrastructure Services. The Company has not adjusted revenue or cost of revenue for the year ended September 30, 2003 as such change was not material. Further, such adjustment would have no material impact on previously reported operating income, net income or cash flow. The remaining increase in 2004 net revenue resulted primarily from increased demand and higher selling prices at Tyco Electrical & Metal Products and at Tyco Fire & Building Products and favorable foreign currency exchanges rates in all businesses ($298 million). Further contributing to the increase, although to a much lesser extent, were improved business conditions at Infrastructure Services due primarily to an improved construction market and continued market share growth. Sales remained flat at Flow Control as the impact of lower levels of non residential construction and industrial capital spending, primarily in North America, were offset by improved activity in other end markets and geographic regions. The 71.3% increase in operating income and the 2.3 percentage point increase in margin in 2004 as compared to 2003 were due primarily to increased net revenue discussed above, the impact of cost reduction programs initiated in prior periods and the positive impact of foreign currency ($31 million). 41 These favorable increases were partly offset by the impact of higher raw material costs. Additionally, operating income includes net restructuring, impairment and divestiture charges of $62 million in 2004 compared to $56 million (discussed below) in 2003. Included in the $62 million charge is $53 million of restructuring and $4 million of impairment charges related to the consolidation of manufacturing, distribution and office locations and activities at Flow Control and Infrastructure Services. The remaining $5 million divestiture charge primarily relates to an impairment of goodwill related to the sale of a business. The revenue reclassification at Infrastructure Services discussed above had no impact on operating income for 2004; however, this adjustment lowered 2004 operating margin by 1.5 percentage points. During 2003, we recorded charges totaling $56 million, which includes charges of $32 million related to changes in estimates recorded in connection with the Companys intensified internal audits, detailed controls and operating reviews, and as a result of applying managements judgments and estimates (including $19 million related to adjustments to workers compensation and $13 million associated with asset reserves). These charges also include charges of $8 million, of which a $6 million charge is included in cost of sales, for 2003 restructuring plans partially offset by changes in estimates due to actual costs being less than originally anticipated, charges for the impairment of long lived assets of $2 million relating to manufacturing and distribution consolidation at Flow Control and cost reduction projects, and other costs of $14 million included within selling, general and administrative expenses primarily related to the reorganization and consolidation of a manufacturing facility and certain business offices. Corporate and Other Corporate net revenue was $29 million, $25 million and $14 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which related to the TGN business. Corporate expense was $231 million, $397 million and $1,172 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. During 2005, we recorded a $303 million gain on the sale of the TGN business and TGN operating losses of $54 million. In addition, corporate expenses for 2005 included a $50 million charge representing the best estimate of the amount in fines and penalties that the Company will likely pay to resolve the matters raised in the SEC investigation that commenced in June 2002, as well as a $70 million charge for estimated legacy contingencies related to former executives employment. Corporate expense for 2004 includes net charges of $14 million, which consists of charges for the impairment of long lived assets of $8 million and net restructuring charges of $6 million primarily attributable to severance related to the relocation of the corporate headquarters. Expense also included $73 million of operating losses related to the TGN. Corporate expense for 2003 includes charges totaling $824 million. Included within the $824 million is a charge of $91 million for an incremental increase in directors and officers insurance and charges of $39 million related to internal investigation fees. Also included is a charge of $20 million primarily related to severance and benefits for corporate employees and a restructuring credit of $11 million due to actual costs being less than anticipated, both of which were changes in estimates recorded in connection with the Companys intensified internal audits, detailed controls and operating reviews and as a result of applying managements judgments and estimates. Corporate expense also includes net restructuring credits of $10 million, other net charges of $16 million included in selling, general and administrative expenses, and charges for the impairment of long lived assets of $679 million primarily related to the TGN business and, to a lesser extent, the closure and relocation of corporate offices and related severance and benefits. 42 Interest Income and Expense Interest income was $123 million in 2005, as compared to $91 million and $107 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Interest expense was $815 million in 2005, as compared to $956 million in 2004 and $1,147 million in 2003. The decrease in interest expense in 2005 is primarily driven by lower debt balances, partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates on our interest rate swap program compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in interest expense in 2004 over 2003 is primarily the result of a lower average debt balance in 2004 and the favorable impact of interest rate swap agreements executed during the year. The weighted average rates of interest on total debt outstanding during 2005, 2004 and 2003 were 5.6%, 5.2% and 4.9%, respectively. Other Expense, Net On September 12, 2002, indictments were filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York against Mr. L. Dennis Kozlowski, our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Mark H. Swartz, our former Chief Financial Officer and director (together, the "Defendants"), alleging enterprise corruption, fraud, conspiracy, grand larceny, falsifying certain business records and other crimes. On June 17, 2005, a jury convicted the Defendants on 22 of 23 counts in the indictment. On September 19, 2005, the Defendants were sentenced in New York State Supreme Court to serve eight and one third years to twenty five years in prison and to make joint restitution to the Company in the amount of $134 million, resulting from the larceny convictions. The Court ordered the restitution payment to be made by no later than one year from the date of sentencing. The restitution award is comprised of $109 million of previously expensed compensation made to the defendants and reported as "Other expense, net" in prior years and $25 million related to a loan receivable from one of the Defendants which had been and remains reflected in the Companys consolidated financial statements as a receivable. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company recognized $109 million of income, included in "Other expense, net" in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income. The Defendants have filed a notice of appeal of the convictions. The Company considered the collectibility of the restitution award and assessed the likelihood of the Defendants success upon appeal of the larceny convictions, which, if successful, could result in a change to the restitution order, and has concluded that receipt of the restitution award is probable. During 2005, other expense, net also included losses related to the repurchase of outstanding convertible debt prior to its scheduled maturity of $1,013 million. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding debt repurchases. During 2004, other expense, net consisted primarily of a net loss on the retirement of debt. The Company repurchased $303 million of its 7.2% notes due 2008 for cash of $341 million, which resulted in a $38 million loss, including unamortized debt issuance costs, on the retirement of debt. Additionally, the Company repurchased $517 million of its outstanding 2.75% convertible senior debentures with a 2008 put option. The total purchase price paid was $750 million and the repurchase resulted in a $241 million loss on the retirement of debt, including the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs. During 2003, other expense, net consisted primarily of a net loss on the retirement of debt of $128 million and a loss relating to the write down of various investments of $87 million. The value of the investments were reduced when it became evident that the declines in the fair value of the investments were other than temporary, predominately due to the continuing depressed economic conditions, specifically within the telecommunications industry. 43 Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 23.5%, 27.5% and 45.2% for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 2004 to 2005 is primarily the result of the release of valuation allowances, benefits realized related to the TGN divestiture, as well as the court ordered restitution award related to certain former executives for which there is no tax obligation and, to a lesser extent, increased profitability in operations in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. This decrease is partially offset by an increase in charges for which no tax benefit is available such as the loss on retirement of debt, asset impairments and the estimated settlement of the SEC enforcement action. The change in the effective tax rate from 2003 to 2004 was primarily the result of increased profitability in operations primarily in jurisdictions with lower tax rates and a decrease in nondeductible charges. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $1,867 million and $1,967 million at September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109 which requires a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is "more likely than not" that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by these taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as payment is not expected within one year. The Company and its subsidiaries income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. The Company is currently under audit by the IRS for the years 1997 to 2000. In connection with such examinations, certain tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax deficiencies. The Company is reviewing the issues raised by the tax authorities and is contesting certain proposed tax deficiencies. Amounts related to these tax deficiencies and other tax contingencies that management has assessed as probable and estimable have been recorded through the income tax provision. In connection with the IRS audits for the years 1997 to 2000, the Company prepared proposed amendments to these prior period U.S. federal income tax returns resulting in a reduction in the taxable income previously reported. The IRS is currently reviewing the proposed amendments. The Company has not recorded the impact of the proposed amendments, pending the completion of the IRS review. The proposed amendments, if accepted, will result in receipt of refunds or credits and a corresponding reduction to the deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company may prepare proposed amendments to prior period U.S. federal income tax returns for additional periods. The proposed amendments are not expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 44 Except for earnings that are currently distributed, no additional provision has been made for U.S. or non U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or the Company has concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of distribution of such earnings. A liability could arise if amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries. Discontinued Operations and Divestitures Discontinued Operations In May 2005, Tyco announced its intent to explore the divestiture of its Plastics and Adhesives business segment, a global manufacturer of plastic film, specialty tapes and adhesives, coated products and garment hangers. During the third quarter of 2005, as a result of consideration for potential sale and deteriorating operating results in the A&E Products business, the Company performed an interim assessment of the recoverability of both goodwill and long lived assets in the Plastics and Adhesives segment. Estimated fair values of the reporting units and long lived assets at Plastics and Adhesives were developed based on probability weighted expected future cash flows of these assets. As a result of this assessment, the Company determined that the book value of certain long lived assets in the A&E Products reporting unit of Plastics and Adhesives was greater than their estimated fair value and consequently recorded a long lived asset impairment of $40 million. The Company also determined that the book value of the A&E Products reporting unit was in excess of its estimated fair value which resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of $162 million. At September 30, 2005, the Plastics and Adhesives segment met the held for sale criteria and its results of operations have been included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. The Company is negotiating a sales agreement with potential buyers and expects to complete a sale transaction in 2006. The Company has assessed the recoverability of the segments carrying value at September 30, 2005 and will continue to assess recoverability based on current fair values, less cost to sell, until the businesses are sold. Depending on the outcome of the sale negotiations, the Company may incur additional impairment charges. During 2005, the Company divested eight businesses which were reported as discontinued operations within Fire and Security, Plastics and Adhesives and Engineered Products and Services. The Company reported losses on sale or additional impairments to write the carrying value of such assets down to their estimated fair value of $56 million ($55 million after tax) during 2005. During 2004, the Company reported losses on the sale of discontinued operations of $132 million, of which $36 million related to goodwill impairments, to write the carrying value of such assets down to their fair value, less cost to sell. (Gains) losses and impairments on divestitures, net During 2003, the Company conducted a comprehensive review of its core businesses, and as a result, implemented a divestiture program in early 2004. During 2004, in connection with the program, the Company divested twenty one and liquidated four non core businesses across all business segments primarily within Fire and Security. During 2004, the Company recorded net losses and impairments on divestitures of $116 million (including $60 million of goodwill impairment charges) in continuing operations in connection with the divestiture or write down to fair value of certain held for sale businesses. 45  In November 2004, Tyco agreed to sell the TGN, its undersea fiber optic telecommunication network. The sale was consummated on June 30, 2005. As part of the sale transaction, Tyco received gross cash proceeds of $130 million, and the purchaser assumed certain liabilities. In connection with this sale, Tyco recorded a $303 million pre tax gain which is reflected in (gains) losses and impairments on divestitures in the Consolidated Statement of Income for 2005. The Company has presented the operations of the TGN in continuing operations as the criteria for discontinued operations were not met. During 2005, the Company divested ten businesses that were reported as continuing operations in Fire and Security, Healthcare and Engineered Products and Services. The Company recorded net losses and impairments on divestitures of $32 million, including a $3 million charge reflected in cost of sales, in connection with the divestiture and liquidation of these businesses, as well as the write down to estimated fair value of certain held for sale businesses. Acquisitions In 2005, Surgical, a division in Tycos Healthcare segment, acquired Vivant Medical Inc. ("Vivant"), a developer of microwave ablation medical technology. The transaction is valued at approximately $66 million cash, with up to approximately $35 million additional cash to be paid in the future based on the achievement of certain milestones. The acquisition of Vivant strengthens Healthcares surgical product portfolio. During 2004, the Company completed the acquisition of two businesses within Engineered Products and Services and Fire and Security for an aggregate cost of $9 million. During 2003, the Company purchased seven businesses within Healthcare, Engineered Products and Services, Fire and Security and Electronics for an aggregate cost of $44 million in cash, net of $1 million of cash acquired. These acquisitions were funded utilizing cash from operations. The results of operations of the acquired companies have been included in Tycos consolidated results from the respective acquisition dates. These acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change During 2005, the Company changed the measurement date for its pension and postretirement benefit plans, from September 30th to August 31st. The Company believes that the one month change of measurement date is a preferable change as it allows management adequate time to evaluate and report the actuarial information in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements under the accelerated reporting deadlines. In conjunction with this change, the Company recorded a $21 million after tax gain ($28 million pre tax) cumulative effect adjustment. Refer to Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on retirement plans. During 2003, the Company adopted FIN No. 46, which requires identification of the Companys participation in Variable Interest Entities (VIEs), which are entities with a level of invested equity that is not sufficient to fund future activities to permit them to operate on a stand alone basis, or whose equity holders lack certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest. For entities identified as VIEs, FIN No. 46 sets forth a model to evaluate potential consolidation based on an assessment of which party to VIEs, if any, bears a majority of the risk to its expected losses, or stands to gain from a majority of its expected returns. The Company has programs under which it sells machinery and equipment to investors who, in turn, purchase and receive ownership and security interests in those assets. As such, the Company may have certain investments in those affiliated companies whereby it provides varying degrees of financial 46 support and where the investors are entitled to a share in the results of those entities, but the Company does not consolidate these entities. While these entities may be substantive operating companies, they have been evaluated for potential consolidation under FIN No. 46. The Company had three synthetic lease programs utilized, to some extent, by all of the Companys segments to finance capital expenditures for manufacturing machinery and equipment and for ships used by Tyco Submarine Telecommunications. During 2003, the Company restructured one of the synthetic leases to meet the requirements of FIN No. 46 for off balance sheet accounting. The Company reclassified the remaining two leases as capital leases and, consequently, recorded a $75 million after tax loss ($115 million pre tax) cumulative effect adjustment. One of the capital leases expired in December 2004 and the other is scheduled to expire in July 2006. Change in Fiscal Year and Reporting Calendar Alignment Effective October 1, 2004, Tyco changed its fiscal year end from a calendar fiscal year ending September 30 to a "52 53 week" year ending on the last Friday of September, such that each quarterly period will be 13 weeks in length. For fiscal years in which there are 53 weeks, the fourth quarter reporting period will be 14 weeks, with the first such occurrence taking place in fiscal 2011. In addition, certain of the Companys subsidiaries consistently closed their books up to one month prior to the Companys fiscal period end. These subsidiaries now report results for the same period as the reported results of the consolidated Company. The impact of this change is not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This change is also consistent with the Companys ongoing efforts to enhance controls and improve the transparency of its reporting, as this change better aligns the Companys external reporting with the Companys internal operational processes. Net income for the transition period related to this change was $26 million and was reported within Shareholders Equity.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. Depreciation and Amortization Method for Security Monitoring Systems Tyco generally considers its electronic security assets in three asset pools: internally generated residential systems, internally generated commercial systems and customer accounts acquired through the ADT dealer program. The determination of the depreciable lives of subscriber systems, as defined below, included in property, plant and equipment, and the amortizable lives of customer contracts and related customer relationships included in intangible assets, are primarily based on historical attrition rates, third party lifing studies and the useful life of the underlying tangible asset. The realizable value and remaining useful lives of these assets could be impacted by changes in customer attrition rates. If the attrition rates were to rise, Tyco may be required to accelerate the depreciation and amortization. With respect to Tycos depreciation policy for security monitoring systems installed in residential and commercial customer premises, the costs of these systems are combined in separate pools for internally generated residential and internally generated commercial account customers (collectively "subscriber systems"), and generally depreciated over ten to fourteen years. Tyco concluded that for residential and commercial account pools the straight line method of depreciation over a ten to fourteen year period continues to be appropriate given the observed actual attrition data for these pools. Tyco purchases residential security monitoring contracts from an external network of independent dealers who operate under the ADT dealer program. The purchase price of these customer contracts is recorded as an intangible asset (i.e., contracts and related customer relationships). 47  Intangible assets arising from the ADT dealer program are amortized in pools determined by the month of contract acquisition on an accelerated basis over the period and pattern of economic benefit that is expected to be obtained from the customer relationship. Tyco believes that the accelerated method that presently best achieves the matching objective described above is the double declining balance method based on a ten year life for the first eight years of the estimated life of the customer relationships converting to the straight line method of amortization for the remaining four years of the estimated relationship period. Actual attrition data is regularly reviewed in order to assess the continued applicability of the accelerated method of amortization described above. Attrition rates for customers in our Global Electronic Security Services business were 14.8%, 15.1% and 15.9% on a trailing 12 month basis for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Revenue Recognition Contract sales for the installation of fire protection systems, large security intruder systems, undersea cable systems and other construction related projects are recorded primarily on the percentage of completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon contracted revenue and related estimated cost to completion. The risk of this methodology is its dependence upon estimates of costs to completion, which are subject to the uncertainties inherent in long term contracts. Revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they first become determinable. If estimates are inaccurate, there is risk that our revenue and profits for the period may be overstated or understated. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other markets participants. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience and trend analysis. Loss Contingencies Accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings, self insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on managements judgment, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates. Additionally, the Company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. Income Taxes In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. Deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and international pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income. Any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant 48 impact on our future earnings. If a change in a valuation allowance occurs, which was established in connection with an acquisition, such adjustment may impact goodwill rather than the income tax provision. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such charges that would have a material effect on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If the tax liabilities relate to tax uncertainties existing at the date of the acquisition of a business, the adjustment of such tax liabilities will result in an adjustment to the goodwill recorded at the date of acquisition. Goodwill In performing the goodwill assessments, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. Since managements judgment is involved in performing goodwill valuation analyses, there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated or understated. We elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for all reporting units. Goodwill valuations have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. This approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors and income tax rates. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in a goodwill impairment in future periods. Disruptions to our business such as end market conditions and protracted economic weakness, unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units, the divestiture of a significant component of a reporting unit and market capitalization declines may result in our having to perform a goodwill impairment first step valuation analysis for some or all of our reporting units prior to the required annual assessment. These types of events and the resulting analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future. The Company recorded goodwill impairments of $162 million in 2005, included in (loss) income from discontinued operations, and $96 million in 2004, of which $36 million is included in (loss) income from discontinued operations and the remaining $60 million is included in (gains) losses and impairments on divestitures, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Goodwill impairments in 2003 totaled $278 million. Long Lived Assets Assets held and used by the Company, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of evaluating the recoverability of long lived assets to be held and used, a recoverability test is performed based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk. Impairments to long lived assets to be disposed of are recorded based upon the fair value of the applicable assets. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of long lived assets, there is a risk that the carrying value of our long lived assets may be overstated or understated. 49  Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes the sources of our cash flow from operating activities and the use of a portion of that cash in our operations for the years ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 ($ in millions): 2005 2004 2003 Cash flows from operating activities: Operating income $ 5,795 $ 5,236 $ 2,877 Non cash restructuring and other credits, net (18 ) (33 ) (46 ) Impairment of long lived assets 6 51 825 (Gains) losses and impairments on divestitures, net (271 ) 111 Goodwill impairment 278 Depreciation and amortization(1) 2,100 2,119 2,142 Deferred income taxes (41 ) 167 367 Provision for losses on accounts receivable and inventory 234 318 573 Debt and refinancing cost amortization 30 55 116 Other, net(2) 200 78 96 Net (increase) decrease in working capital (204 ) 94 (344 ) Decrease in sale of accounts receivable (18 ) (929 ) (119 ) Interest income 123 91 107 Interest expense (815 ) (956 ) (1,147 ) Income tax expense (984 ) (1,123 ) (729 ) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 6,137 $ 5,279 $ 4,996 Other cash flow items: Capital expenditures, net(3) $ (1,272 ) $ (987 ) $ (1,255 ) Decrease in sale of accounts receivable 18 929 119 Acquisition of customer accounts (ADT dealer program) (328 ) (254 ) (597 ) Cash paid for purchase accounting and holdback/earn out liabilities (47 ) (105 ) (267 ) Voluntary pension contributions 115 567 205 (1)Includes depreciation expense of $1,447 million, $1,428 million and $1,420 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively and amortization of intangible assets ($653 million, $691 million and $722 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively). (2)Includes the add back of net losses on the retirement of debt of $1,013 million, $284 million and $128 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. (3)Includes net proceeds of $94 million, $141 million and $124 million received for the sale/disposition of property, plant and equipment in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The net change in total working capital was a cash decrease of $204 million in 2005. The significant changes in working capital included a $714 million increase in accounts receivable offset by an increase of $424 million in accounts payable. The provision for losses on accounts receivable and inventory decreased from $318 million during the year ended September 30, 2004 to $234 million for the current period. This decrease was largely the result of improved accounts receivable aging due to an overall improved credit profile of the customer base, particularly in the Fire and Security Segment, and better collections. Additionally, our allowance for doubtful accounts decreased from $516 million at September 30, 2004 to $422 million at September 30, 2005 primarily due to the write off of fully reserved receivables and improved aging of accounts receivable at Fire and Security. The change in the inventory provision also contributed to the decrease, however to a much lesser extent. 50  Cash flows from operating activities and other cash flow items by segment were as follows for the year ended September 30, 2005 ($ in millions): Fire and Security Electronics Healthcare Engineered Products and Services Corporate and Other Total Cash flows from operating activities: Operating income (loss) $ 1,216 $ 1,852 $ 2,286 $ 672 $ (231 ) $ 5,795 Restructuring, impairment and other (credits) charges, net (11 ) 3 2 (6 ) (12 ) Non cash losses and impairments on divestitures, net 18 8 (1 ) (296 ) (271 ) Depreciation 582 491 262 104 8 1,447 Intangible assets amortization 524 68 57 4 653 Depreciation and amortization 1,106 559 319 108 8 2,100 Deferred income taxes (41 ) (41 ) Provision for losses on accounts receivable and inventory 71 84 41 38 234 Debt and refinancing cost amortization 30 30 Net (increase) decrease in working capital and other(1) (277 ) (311 ) 236 (88 ) 436 (4 ) Decrease in sale of accounts receivable (8 ) (1 ) (9 ) (18 ) Interest income 123 123 Interest expense (815 ) (815 ) Income tax expense (984 ) (984 ) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,126 $ 2,172 $ 2,884 $ 731 $ (1,776 ) $ 6,137 Other cash flow items: Capital expenditures, net $ (389 ) $ (458 ) $ (326 ) $ (88 ) $ (11 ) $ (1,272 ) Decrease in sale of accounts receivable 8 1 9 18 Acquisition of customer accounts (ADT dealer program) (328 ) (328 ) Cash paid for purchase accounting and holdback/earn out liabilities (10 ) (18 ) (14 ) (5 ) (47 ) Voluntary pension contributions 82 25 8 115 (1)Includes the add back of $1,013 million related to a loss on the retirement of debt. During 2005, 2004 and 2003 we paid out $161 million, $228 million and $499 million, respectively, in cash related to restructuring activities. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our restructuring activities. We anticipate a cash outflow of approximately $50 million in 2006 related to restructuring activities in our Electronics segment. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, Tyco paid $328 million, $254 million and $597 million of cash, respectively, to acquire 0.4 million, 0.3 million and 0.6 million customer contracts for electronic security services through the ADT dealer program. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, we paid $47 million, $105 million and $267 million, respectively, in cash for purchase accounting and holdback/earn out liabilities. Holdback liabilities represent a portion of the purchase price that is withheld from the seller pending finalization of the acquisition balance sheet. Certain acquisitions have provisions which require Tyco to make additional "earn out" payments to the sellers if the acquired company achieves certain milestones subsequent to its acquisition by Tyco. These earn out payments are tied to certain performance measures, such as revenue, gross margin or earnings growth. At September 30, 2005 holdback/earn out liabilities on our Consolidated Balance 51 Sheets were $148 million, of which $79 million are included in accrued and other current liabilities and $69 million are included in other liabilities. At September 30, 2005, the acquisition liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets were $70 million, of which $24 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and $46 million is included in other liabilities. During 2005, the Company sold various businesses for aggregate net proceeds of $295 million of which $120 million relates to the TGN business. The purchaser of the TGN also assumed certain liabilities. In 2005, Surgical, a division of Tycos Healthcare segment, acquired Vivant, a developer of microwave ablation medical technology. The transaction is valued at approximately $66 million cash, with up to approximately $35 million additional cash to be paid in the future based on the achievement of certain milestones. Additionally, in November 2005, Tycos Healthcare segment acquired a controlling interest in Floreane Medical Implants, a manufacturer of surgical mesh products. Both of these transactions strengthen Healthcares surgical product portfolio. We continue to fund capital expenditures to improve the cost structure of our businesses, to invest in new processes and technology, and to maintain high quality production standards. Capital spending increased to $1.3 billion in 2005 from $1.0 billion in 2004. The level of capital expenditures is not expected to exceed depreciation in 2006 and is expected to increase slightly relative to the level of spending in 2005. The amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during the year was $790 million. During the first half of 2006, we expect cash outflows of approximately $500 million for resolution of certain previously accrued legal and legacy matters including a patent dispute in the Healthcare segment, an SEC enforcement action and certain holdback liabilities. Capitalization Shareholders equity was $32.5 billion or $16.10 per share, at September 30, 2005, compared to $30.3 billion or $15.07 per share, at September 30, 2004. This increase was due primarily to net income of $3.0 billion and share options exercised of $351 million. These increases were partially offset by dividends declared of $805 million, the repurchase of shares of $300 million, and an increase in the minimum pension liability of $200 million, net of income taxes. At September 30, 2005, total debt decreased $4.0 billion to $12.6 billion, as compared to $16.6 billion at September 30, 2004. Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization (total debt and shareholders equity) was 28% at September 30, 2005 and 35% at September 30, 2004. The decrease in debt resulted principally from our repurchase of convertible debentures as discussed below ($2.0 billion) and scheduled repayments of debentures ($1.8 billion). Our cash balance decreased to $3.2 billion at September 30, 2005, as compared to $4.5 billion at September 30, 2004. The decrease in cash was primarily due to the convertible debt repurchases and scheduled debt repayments referred to above. Capital expenditures, and to a lesser extent, dividend payments and acquisition of customer accounts, also contributed to the cash decrease. Furthermore, the Company used $300 million of cash to repurchase shares in the open market in connection with the $1.5 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in July 2005. These decreases were partially offset by cash flows from operations. On December 16, 2004, Tyco International Group S.A., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company organized under the laws of Luxembourg ("TIGSA"), entered into a $1.0 billion 5 year revolving credit facility expiring on December 16, 2009. This facility replaced TIGSAs $1.0 billion 364 day revolving credit facility, which was terminated prior to its scheduled expiration date of December 20, 2004. There 52 were no amounts outstanding under the 364 day revolving credit facility on the date of its termination. TIGSA also holds a $1.5 billion 3 year revolving bank credit facility expiring on December 22, 2006 and a $500 million 3 year unsecured letter of credit facility expiring on June 15, 2007. At September 30, 2005, letters of credit in the amount of $488 million have been issued under the $500 million facility and a remaining $12 million is available for issuance. There were no amounts borrowed under any of these facilities. In 2005, the Company repurchased $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 2.75% convertible senior debentures due 2018 with a 2008 put option for cash of $1.8 billion and $750 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 3.125% convertible senior debentures due 2023 with a 2015 put option for cash of $1.1 billion. These repurchases resulted in a $1.0 billion loss on the retirement of debt, including the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs, which is reflected in other expense, net, in the Consolidated Statement of Income. We plan to use available cash to continue to fund internal growth and cost reduction opportunities within our businesses. Additionally, we believe that our cash flow generation capability will allow us to continue to strengthen our balance sheet and return capital to shareholders. While debt reduction and share repurchases are our focus in the near term, we will also consider appropriate acquisitions should the opportunity arise. The Companys bank credit agreements contain a number of financial covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and minimum levels of net worth, and limits on the incurrence of liens. At September 30, 2005, the Company had two remaining synthetic lease facilities, of which one will expire in July of 2006, with other covenants, including interest coverage and leverage ratios. The Companys outstanding indentures contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges, subsidiary debt and sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants is presently considered restrictive to the Companys operations. The Company is currently in compliance with all of its debt covenants. In 2005, we made voluntary contributions to our pension plans totaling approximately $115 million. On December 9, 2004, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend on our common shares from $0.0125 to $0.10 per share. As a result, dividend payments were $628 million in 2005 and are expected to approximate $800 million in 2006. The following table details the trend of our debt ratings: At September 30, 2005 At September 30, 2004 Short Term Long Term Short Term Long Term Moodys Prime 3 Baa 3 Prime 3 Baa3 Standard & Poors A2 BBB+ A2 BBB Fitch F2 BBB+ F2 BBB+ On August 3, 2005, Standard & Poors Rating Services raised the corporate credit and senior unsecured ratings for Tyco International Ltd. and subsidiaries to BBB+ from BBB. The security ratings set forth above are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 53 Commitments and Contingencies Contractual Obligations A summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for debt, minimum lease payment obligations under non cancelable operating leases and other obligations at September 30, 2005 is as follows ($ in millions): 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Debt(1) $ 1,954 $ 759 $ 1,383 $ 1,734 $ 19 $ 6,705 Operating leases(2) 583 449 344 248 165 548 Purchase obligations(3) 183 29 20 9 9 28 Total contractual cash obligations(4) $ 2,720 $ 1,237 $ 1,747 $ 1,991 $ 193 $ 7,281 (1)Includes capital lease obligations and excludes interest. (2)Includes obligations under an off balance sheet leasing arrangement under which a subsidiary of the Company has the option to buy five cable laying sea vessels (see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). (3)Purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of good and services. (4)Minimum pension funding requirements are not included as such amounts have not been determined for all periods presented. The minimum required contributions to our pension plans are expected to be approximately $118 million in 2006. At September 30, 2005, the Company had outstanding letters of credit and letters of guarantee in the amount of $1.4 billion. At September 30, 2005, TIGSA had unsecured credit facilities of $1.5 billion due December 22, 2006, and $1.0 billion due December 16, 2009, both of which were undrawn and available (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, certain of the Companys operating subsidiaries have overdraft and similar types of facilities, which total $605 million, of which $599 million was undrawn and available at September 30, 2005. These facilities expire at various dates through the year 2013, most of which are renewable and are established primarily within our international operations. At September 30, 2005, the Company had a contingent purchase price liability of $80 million related to the 2001 acquisition of Com Net by Electronics. This represents the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of Com Net only after the construction and installation of a communications system for the State of Florida is finished and the State has approved the system based on the guidelines set forth in the contract. A liability for this contingency has not been recorded in Tycos Consolidated Financial Statements as the outcome of this contingency cannot be reasonably determined. In June 2004, TIGSA entered into a $500 million 3 year unsecured letter of credit facility. The facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit, supported by a related line of credit facility. TIGSA may only borrow under the line of credit agreement to reimburse the bank for obligations with respect to letters of credit issued under this facility. The covenants under this facility are substantially similar to TIGSAs bank credit facilities entered into during December 2003 and the indenture related to TIGSAs 6% notes due 2013 issued in November 2003. TIGSA would pay interest on any outstanding borrowings at a variable interest rate, based on the banks base rate or the Eurodollar rate, as defined. Upon the occurrence of certain credit events, the interest rate on the outstanding borrowings becomes fixed. The issuance of letters of credit under this facility during 2004 enabled the Company to release approximately $480 million of restricted cash and investments. As of September 30, 2005, letters of credit in the amount of $488 million have been issued under the $500 million facility 54 and a remaining $12 million is available for issuance. There were no amounts borrowed under any of these facilities. In the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Legal Matters Class Actions For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos securities class actions, shareholder derivative litigation, ERISA litigation and investigation, and litigation against our former senior management, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings. We are generally obligated to indemnify our directors and officers and our former directors and officers who are named as defendants in some or all of these matters to the extent required by Bermuda law. In addition, our insurance carriers may decline coverage, or our coverage may be insufficient to cover our expenses and liability, in some or all of these matters. We are unable at this time to estimate what our ultimate liability in these matters may be, and it is possible that we will be required to pay judgments or settlements and incur expenses, in excess of any insurance coverage, in aggregate amounts that would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or probable losses, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters. Investigation For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to governmental investigations related to Tyco see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Subpoenas and Document Requests From Governmental Entities. We cannot predict when these investigations will be completed, nor can we predict what the results of these investigations may be. It is possible that we will be required to pay material fines, consent to injunctions on future conduct, lose the ability to conduct business with government instrumentalities (which in turn could negatively impact our business with non governmental customers) or suffer other penalties, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. It is not possible to estimate the amount of loss, or range of possible loss, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters. In 2005, the Company recorded a charge of $50 million, which represents the Companys best estimate of the amount in fines and penalties management believes the Company will likely pay to resolve the matters raised in the SECs investigation. The Company is engaged in discussions with the SECs Division of Enforcement to resolve the matters raised in the SECs investigation. Final resolution of these matters is subject to a number of uncertainties, including finalizing the terms of a settlement that the Enforcement Staff will agree to recommend to the Commission, the Companys submission of an offer of settlement approved by the Tyco Board of Directors, and the Commissions approval of the settlement offer. Until such events have occurred, the charge is subject to change. Intellectual Property Litigation For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos intellectual property litigation, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Intellectual Property Litigation. Environmental Matters For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos environmental matters, see Item 1. Business Environmental Matters. 55  Asbestos Matters Tyco and some of its subsidiaries are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials. Consistent with the national trend of increased asbestos related litigation, the Company has observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits in the past several years. The majority of these cases have been filed against subsidiaries in Healthcare and Engineered Products and Services. A limited number of the cases allege premises liability, based on claims that individuals were exposed to asbestos while on a subsidiarys property. A majority of the cases involve product liability claims, based principally on allegations of past distribution of heat resistant industrial products incorporating asbestos or the past distribution of industrial valves that incorporated asbestos containing gaskets or packing. Each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants. Tycos involvement in asbestos cases has been limited because its subsidiaries did not mine or produce asbestos. Furthermore, in the Companys experience, a large percentage of these claims were never substantiated and have been dismissed by the courts. The Company will continue to vigorously defend these lawsuits and the Company has not suffered an adverse verdict in a trial court proceeding related to asbestos claims. When appropriate, the Company settles claims; however, the total amount paid to date to settle and defend all asbestos claims has been immaterial. As of September 30, 2005, there were approximately 14,000 asbestos liability cases pending against the Company and its subsidiaries. During the 2005, the Company undertook a detailed study of its pending asbestos claims and also developed an estimate of asbestos claims that were incurred but not reported, as well as related insurance and indemnification recoveries. The impact of this study was not material to the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Companys estimate of the liability for pending and future claims is based on claim experience over the past five years and covers claims expected to be filed through 2012. The Company believes that it has adequate amounts recorded related to these matters. While it is not possible at this time to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome of these asbestos related proceedings, the Company believes that the final outcome of all known and anticipated future claims, after taking into account its substantial indemnification rights and insurance coverage, will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Income Taxes Tyco and its subsidiaries income tax returns are periodically examined by various regulatory tax authorities. In connection with such examinations, tax authorities, including the United States Internal Revenue Service, have raised issues and proposed tax deficiencies. The Company is reviewing the issues raised by the tax authorities and is contesting certain of the proposed tax deficiencies. Amounts related to these tax deficiencies and other tax contingencies that management has assessed as probable and estimable have been recorded through the income tax provision, equity or goodwill, as applicable. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "AJCA"), signed into law in October 2004, replaces an export incentive with a deduction from domestic manufacturing income. It is not expected that the AJCA will have a material impact on the Companys income tax provision. The AJCA also allows the Company to repatriate up to $500 million of permanently reinvested foreign earnings in 2006 at an effective tax rate of 5.25%. This incentive would apply to the Companys U.S. owned controlled foreign companies. The Company continues to review whether to take advantage of this provision of the AJCA. 56 Compliance Matters In 2003 an allegation was brought to our attention that during the period from 1999 through 2003 certain improper payments were made by a non U.S. subsidiary of Tyco with 2004 revenue of $40 million. With the assistance of outside counsel, we conducted an internal investigation into this allegation to determine whether certain payments were correctly recorded in the books and records of the subsidiary. We have taken remedial steps and have reported the results of our investigation to the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the SEC. We are cooperating with their inquiries. On March 29, 2005 and August 9, 2005, Tyco reported to the DOJ and the SEC the investigative steps and remedial measures that it has taken in response to a number of recent allegations of improper payments. Tyco also informed the DOJ and the SEC that it has retained outside counsel to perform a company wide baseline review of its policies, controls and practices with respect to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, that it would continue to make periodic progress reports to them, and that it would present its factual findings upon conclusion of the baseline review. At this time, Tyco cannot predict the outcome of its disclosures of these matters reported to regulatory and law enforcement authorities and therefore cannot estimate the range of potential loss or extent of risk, if any, that may result from an adverse resolution of any or all of these matters. Other Matters The Company is a defendant in a number of other pending legal proceedings incidental to present and former operations, acquisitions and dispositions. The Company does not expect the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Backlog At September 30, 2005, we had a backlog of unfilled orders of $13.6 billion, compared to a backlog of $13.0 billion at September 30, 2004. We expect that approximately 75% of our backlog at September 30, 2005 will be filled during 2006. Backlog by reportable industry segment at September 30 is as follows ($ in millions): 2005 2004 Fire and Security $ 6,732 $ 6,726 Engineered Products and Services 4,007 3,469 Electronics 2,591 2,454 Healthcare 272 280 Corporate and Other(1) 120 $ 13,602 $ 13,049 (1)2004 includes the TGN business which was classified as held for sale at September 30, 2004 and sold during 2005. Within Fire and Security, backlog remained flat in part due to increased bookings within Fire Protection in North America, offset by the continued recognition of deferred revenues on leased security systems as a result of the transition to a direct consumer sales model in 2003. Backlog for Fire and Security includes recurring revenue in force, which represents twelve months fees for monitoring and maintenance services under contract in the security business. The amount of recurring revenue in force at September 30, 2005 and September 30, 2004 was $3,550 million and $3,559 million, respectively. Within Engineered Products and Services, backlog increased at Infrastructure Services as a result of projects in Venezuela and Canada, as well as expanding sectors in Flow Control Asia and North America. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates also contributed to the increase. 57 Within Electronics, backlog increased primarily due to stronger orders from improving business conditions across the majority of its end markets. Backlog in Healthcare represents unfilled orders, which, in the nature of the businesses, are normally shipped shortly after purchase orders are received. We do not view backlog in Healthcare to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale of Accounts Receivable Tyco utilized several programs under which it sold participating interests in accounts receivable to investors who, in turn, purchased and received ownership and security interests in those receivables. As collections reduced accounts receivable included in the pool, the Company sold new receivables. The Company retained the risk of credit loss on the receivables and, accordingly, the full amount of the reserve was retained on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The proceeds from the sales were used to repay short term and long term borrowings and for working capital and other corporate purposes and were reported as operating cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The sale proceeds were less than the face amount of accounts receivable sold by an amount that approximated the cost that would have been incurred if commercial paper had been issued backed by these accounts receivable. The discount from the face amount is accounted for as a loss on the sale of receivables and has been included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Such discount aggregated $18 million and $29 million, or 3.1% and 3.5% of the weighted average balance of the receivables outstanding, during 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company retained collection and administrative responsibilities for the participating interests in the defined pool. During 2004, the Company reduced outstanding balances under its accounts receivable programs by $929 million, of which $812 million related to three of its corporate accounts receivable programs which were terminated in 2005. No amounts were utilized under these programs at September 30, 2004 and through the date of termination. The remaining reduction of $117 million related to certain of the Companys international businesses selling fewer accounts receivable as a short term financing mechanism. These transactions qualify as true sales. The aggregate amount outstanding under international accounts receivable programs was $80 million and $99 million at September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Variable Interest Entities The Company has programs under which it sells machinery and equipment to investors who, in turn, purchase and receive ownership and security interests in those assets. As such, the Company may have certain investments in those affiliated companies whereby it provides varying degrees of financial support and where the investors are entitled to a share in the results of those entities but do not consolidate these entities. While these entities may be substantive operating companies, they have been evaluated for potential consolidation under FIN No. 46. The Company had three synthetic lease programs utilized, to some extent, by all of the Companys segments to finance capital expenditures for manufacturing machinery and equipment and for ships used by Tyco Submarine Telecommunications. During 2003 the Company restructured one of the synthetic leases to meet the requirements of FIN No. 46 for off balance sheet accounting. In 2003 in conjunction with adopting FIN No. 46, the Company also evaluated other investments and concluded that four joint ventures that were previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting within Tyco Infrastructure Services, in which we own a minority interest, met the consolidation criteria set forth in FIN No. 46. Accordingly, these ventures were consolidated onto the Companys balance sheet effective July 1, 2003, and were subsequently deconsolidated as of March 31, 2004 upon the adoption of FIN No. 46R. 58 Guarantees Certain of the Companys business segments have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from 2006 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In disposing of assets or businesses, the Company often provides representations, warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. The Company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the Company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows. The Company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item I. Business Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. The Company has guaranteed the fair value of certain vessels not to exceed $235 million, and as of September 30, 2005 expects the obligation to be $54 million, which is recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet, based on its estimate of the fair value of the vessels (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources Contractual Obligations" above). In the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company generally records estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. For further information on estimated product warranty, see Notes 1 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Accounting Pronouncements In September 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") reached a consensus on EITF No. 04 8, "The Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted Earnings per Share." This EITF requires that contingently convertible debt securities with a market price trigger be included in diluted earnings per share, regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met. EITF No. 04 8 became effective for Tyco on October 1, 2004 and required retroactive restatement of previously reported earnings per share. The adoption of this EITF did not impact diluted earnings per share for any period presented. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4." SFAS No. 151 amends Accounting Research Bulletin ("ARB") No. 43, Chapter 4, to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials (spoilage) should be recognized as current period charges. In addition, SFAS No. 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No. 151 will be effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 for Tyco. The adoption of SFAS No. 151 is not expected to have a significant impact on the Companys results of its operations, financial position or cash flows. 59 In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which requires all share based payments to employees to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. SFAS No. 123R replaces SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 ("APB Opinion No. 25"), "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." Effective October 1, 2005, Tyco adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective method. Under this method compensation expense is recorded for all unvested options over the related vesting period beginning in the quarter of adoption. The Company previously applied the intrinsic value based method prescribed in APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting for employee stock based compensation. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company will recognize stock based compensation costs ratably over the service period, which is the earlier of the retirement eligibility date, if the grant contains provisions such that the award becomes fully vested upon retirement, or the stated vesting period. For grants issued to retirement eligible employees prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company will recognize compensation costs over the stated vesting period with acceleration of any unrecognized compensation costs if and when an employee elects to retire. This statement also amends SFAS No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows," to require that excess tax benefits be reflected as financing cash inflows rather than operating cash inflows. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R is estimated to result in a compensation charge for fiscal year 2006 in the range of approximately $0.06 to $0.07 per diluted share. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 107 regarding the Staffs interpretation of SFAS No. 123R. This interpretation provides the Staffs views regarding interactions between SFAS No. 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of share based payments for public companies. The interpretive guidance is intended to assist companies in applying the provisions of SFAS No. 123R and investors and users of the financial statements in analyzing the information provided. The Company will follow the guidance prescribed in SAB No. 107 in connection with its adoption of SFAS No. 123R. In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation ("FIN") No. 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143." This Interpretation clarifies the timing of liability recognition for legal obligations associated with an asset retirement when the timing and (or) method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN No. 47 is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. The Company is currently assessing the impact that FIN No. 47 will have on the results of its operations, financial position or cash flows. In June 2005, the FASB issued Staff Position ("FSP") No. 143 1, "Accounting for Electronic Equipment Waste Obligations," which provides guidance on accounting for historical waste obligations associated with the European Union Waste, Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive ("WEEE Directive"). FSP No. 143 1 is effective for the first reporting period ending after June 8, 2005 or the date of the adoption of the WEEE Directive into law by the applicable European Union member country. Because European Union member countries have not yet, among other steps, (i) fully enacted their national laws relating to WEEE, (ii) completed implementation of their administrative measures and programs, (iii) clarified the scope of products considered WEEE, and or (iv) established pricing for recycling of WEEE, the Company can not at this time reasonably estimate the effect of applying this guidance in future periods. The Company continues to monitor WEEE developments in the respective EU countries in an effort to reflect the impact of this Directive. 60   Forward Looking Information Certain statements in this report are "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are subject to market risk associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. In order to manage the volatility relating to our more significant market risks, we enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts, cross currency swaps, foreign currency options, and interest rate swaps. We do not anticipate any material changes in our primary market risk exposures in 2006. We utilize established risk management policies and procedures in executing derivative financial instrument transactions. We do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Derivative financial instruments related to interest rate sensitivity of debt obligations, intercompany cross border transactions and anticipated non functional currency cash flows, are used with the goal of mitigating a significant portion of these exposures when it is cost effective to do so. Counterparties to derivative financial instruments are limited to financial institutions with at least an A/A2 long term debt rating.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the Selected Financial Data and our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements due to many factors, including but not limited to those under the headings "Risk Factors" and "Forward Looking Information." Introduction The Consolidated Financial Statements include the consolidated accounts of Tyco International Ltd., a company organized under the laws of Bermuda, and its subsidiaries (hereinafter collectively referred to as "we," the "Company" or "Tyco") and have been prepared in United States dollars, and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Company operates in the following business segments: Fire and Security designs, manufactures, installs, monitors and services electronic security and fire protection systems; Electronics designs, manufactures and distributes electrical and electronic components; Healthcare designs, manufactures and distributes medical devices and supplies, imaging agents, pharmaceuticals and adult incontinence and infant care products; and Engineered Products and Services designs, manufactures, distributes and services engineered products, including industrial valves and controls, as well as steel tubular goods, and provides environmental and other industrial consulting services. Unless otherwise indicated, references in this Annual Report to 2005, 2004 and 2003 are to Tycos fiscal years ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Overview Our business strategy focuses on enhancing internal growth and operational efficiency for existing Tyco businesses. We achieve this goal primarily through new product innovation, increased market share, and continued geographic expansion. We have implemented and will continue to implement additional Six Sigma initiatives across our business segments to achieve best in class operating practices. The Company has engaged in a series of restructuring programs since November 2003 through which we have made our operations more efficient, including exiting certain non core businesses or business lines and streamlining general operations. The impact of these restructuring programs on the Companys operations is discussed in "Operating Results" and "Segment Results." Also, during the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company committed to a plan to sell its Plastics and Adhesives segment. As such, the operations of our Plastics and Adhesives segment are reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Details related to the Companys divestiture program and the related discontinued operations are discussed in "Divestitures and Discontinued Operations." We are continuing to assess the strategic fit of our various businesses and are considering additional divestitures where businesses do not align with our long term vision. In 2005, we continued to utilize cash to fund internal growth, strengthen the balance sheet and return capital to shareholders. During 2005, we utilized $3.0 billion to repurchase our convertible debentures prior to their scheduled maturities. In total, these repurchases reduced our diluted share count by approximately 88.9 million shares on an annualized basis with the added benefit of reducing our debt and interest expense. In addition, we utilized $2.0 billion in cash for scheduled repayments of debentures. Also, in July 2005, Tycos Board of Directors approved a $1.5 billion share repurchase 34 program. As of September 30, 2005, we have repurchased 10.5 million of our common shares for $300 million. In the two weeks following the end of the fourth quarter of 2005, we have repurchased an additional 7.9 million of our common shares for $216 million. As a result of this program, we anticipate spending a total of approximately $2 billion through the second quarter of 2006 for these repurchases. During the first quarter of 2005, we announced a substantial increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.0125 per share to $0.10 per share. As a result, dividend payments for 2005 increased to $628 million from $100 million in the comparable prior year period. References to Tyco are to the Companys continuing operations. Prior year amounts have been reclassified to exclude the results of discontinued operations and to comparatively reflect changes in the Companys segment reporting. The operating results of the TGN are presented within Corporate and Other through the date of its disposal in the third quarter of 2005. Information for 2003 has been reclassified to reflect the transfer of Tycos Precision Interconnect business from Healthcare to Electronics in 2004. Operating Results The following table details net revenue and earnings for the years ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 ($ in millions): 2005 2004 2003 Revenue from product sales $ 31,955 $ 30,337 $ 27,114 Service revenue 7,772 8,074 7,142 Net revenue $ 39,727 $ 38,411 $ 34,256 Operating income $ 5,795 $ 5,236 $ 2,877 Interest income 123 91 107 Interest expense (815 ) (956 ) (1,147 ) Other expense, net (911 ) (286 ) (223 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest 4,192 4,085 1,614 Income taxes (984 ) (1,123 ) (729 ) Minority interest (9 ) (14 ) (3 ) Income from continuing operations 3,199 2,948 882 (Loss) income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes (188 ) (69 ) 173 Income before cumulative effect of accounting change 3,011 2,879 1,055 Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of income taxes 21 (75 ) Net income $ 3,032 $ 2,879 $ 980 Net revenue increased $1.3 billion, or 3.4%, for 2005 as compared to 2004, which resulted from growth in all segments.

Foreign currency exchange rates favorably affected operating income by $230 million. Operating income for 2003 was unfavorably impacted by net charges totaling $1,625 million. These charges consisted of: (i) charges for the impairment of long lived assets of $815 million; (ii) charges recorded for changes in estimates of $298 million which arose from the Companys intensified internal audits and detailed controls and operating reviews (includes net restructuring credits of $72 million, of which credits of $13 million are included in costs of sales, charges for the impairment of long lived assets of $10 million, charges of $240 million included in selling, general and administrative expenses, and charges of $120 million included in cost of sales); (iii) charges for the impairment of goodwill of $278 million; (iv) other charges of $154 million, of which $34 million is included in cost of sales related primarily to product warranty reserves and the dismantlement of customers ADT security systems, and $120 million is included in selling, general and administrative expenses related primarily to uncollectible accounts receivable, internal investigation fees, as well as severance and facility closures, slightly offset by a credit for changes in estimates of charges recorded in prior periods; (v) a charge of $91 million for a retroactive, incremental premium on prior period directors and officers insurance included in selling, general and administrative expenses; and (vi) net restructuring credits of $11 million, of which charges of $2 million are included in cost of sales.

Results by Geographic Area Net revenue by geographic area for the years ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is as follows ($ in millions): 2005 2004 2003 Net revenue: United States $ 19,635 $ 19,632 $ 18,309 Other Americas 2,202 2,103 1,786 Europe 11,476 10,892 9,256 Asia Pacific 6,414 5,784 4,905 Net revenue(1) $ 39,727 $ 38,411 $ 34,256 (1)Revenue from external customers is attributed to individual countries based on the reporting entity that records the transaction. Segment Results The segment discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in results for each continuing segment. Divestitures have impacted certain of our segments since the establishment of our divestiture program in early 2004. See further details in "Divestitures and Discontinued Operations" and "Acquisitions" below. 36 Fire and Security The following table sets forth net revenue and operating income and margin for Fire and Security for the years ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 ($ in millions): 2005 2004 2003 Revenue from product sales $ 5,299 $ 5,343 $ 4,894 Service revenue 6,204 6,104 5,938 Net revenue $ 11,503 $ 11,447 $ 10,832 Operating income $ 1,216 $ 899 $ 342 Operating margin 10.6 % 7.9 % 3.2 % Net revenue for Fire and Security remained relatively level during 2005 as compared to 2004 as the decrease in product revenue was offset by an increase in service revenue. Revenue from product sales includes sales and installation of security, fire protection and other systems. Net revenue increased due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates ($274 million) and, to a lesser extent, increased sales volume of breathing and intrusion products at Tyco Safety Products as well as growth in our European fire services business. These increases were offset by the impact of divestitures ($315 million) and decreased sales at our security business in Europe. Operating income increased $317 million in 2005 over the prior year. Results for the current period included net restructuring related charges of $9 million as compared to net restructuring, impairment and divestiture charges of $264 million in 2004. Operating income for 2005 was also favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rates ($26 million) as well as cost savings related to operational excellence initiatives and prior year restructuring programs. These cost reductions were partially offset by increased investment in sales and marketing. In addition, 2005 was unfavorably impacted by $18 million of divestiture related charges. Attrition rates for customers in our Global Electronic Security Services business decreased to an average of 14.8% on a trailing twelve month basis for 2005, as compared to 15.1% for 2004 and 15.9% in 2003. Net revenue for Fire and Security increased 5.7% in 2004 as compared to 2003, including a 9.2% increase in product revenue and a 2.8% increase in service revenue. The increase in net revenue was primarily due to favorable currency exchange rates ($526 million) slightly offset by the effects of divestitures ($82 million). To a lesser extent, the increase in net revenue was due to stronger sales to retailers within worldwide security and higher sales volume of breathing systems and video and access control product at Tyco Safety Products. This increase was partially offset by weakness in the worldwide fire service business and Continental Europe Security. Operating income and margin increased significantly in 2004 as compared in 2003 due partially to total charges of $512 million which were recorded during 2003, discussed below. Additionally, the increase in operating income and margin was due to improvements within worldwide security related primarily to the combined impact of a stronger retailer market environment and cost reductions. Also contributing to the increase, to a lesser extent, were improvements within Continental Europe Security as a result of cost saving initiatives and a changing business model and Tyco Safety Products due primarily to increased volumes. The cost savings partly reflect the benefits of the restructuring activities described below. Operating income for 2004 also includes charges totaling $264 million, consisting primarily of restructuring ($175 million, of which $4 million is included in cost of sales), impairment ($34 million) and divestiture ($55 million) charges, substantially all of which are associated with the comprehensive cost reduction measures that began during 2003. Operating income and margin in 2003 included charges totaling $512 million. Included within the $512 million are charges of $266 million (includes charges of $128 million primarily related to 37 adjustments to liabilities such as workers compensation, professional fees, and environmental exposure, a charge of $98 million primarily due to adjusting allowances for doubtful accounts and slow and non moving inventory, as well as a write off of subscriber systems, charges of $34 million for other adjustments primarily related to deferred commissions, and charges of $6 million related to reconciling items) recorded in connection with the Companys intensified internal audits, detailed controls and operating reviews performed during the year. Also included within the $512 million are impairment charges of $143 million primarily related to the impairment of intangible assets associated with the ADT dealer program mostly as a result of increased attrition rates, and to the impairment of property, plant and equipment of subscriber systems and other fixed assets; net restructuring and other charges of $10 million, of which charges of $4 million are included in cost of sales and $3 million is for the write off of non current assets, related to streamlining the business; and other charges of $93 million, of which $34 million is included in cost of sales and $59 million is included in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily related to uncollectible receivables, product warranty and the dismantlement of customers ADT security systems. Included within the $143 million impairment charge and the $10 million net restructuring charge is a charge of $10 million and a credit of $2 million, respectively, also related to changes in estimates recorded during the quarter ended March 31, 2003. Electronics The following table sets forth net revenue and operating income and margin for Electronics for the years ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 ($ in millions): 2005 2004 2003 Revenue from product sales $ 12,042 $ 11,372 $ 10,052 Service revenue 154 450 440 Net revenue $ 12,196 $ 11,822 $ 10,492 Operating income $ 1,852 $ 1,749 $ 1,241 Operating margin 15.2 % 14.8 % 11.8 % Net revenue for Electronics increased $374 million or 3.2% in 2005 as compared to 2004, including a 5.9% increase in product revenue. The increase in net revenue was driven primarily by sales to the automotive, aerospace and defense, consumer electronics, power utilities, communications equipment manufacturing, and communication service markets. In addition, revenue increased substantially due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates ($294 million). These increases were partially offset by the impact of the divestiture of the Electrical Contracting Services business ($353 million). Operating income and operating margin for 2005 increased as compared to 2004 due primarily to increased sales volume, cost savings initiatives and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates ($57 million). These increases were partially offset by an 80 basis point impact of increased commodity costs. Additionally, operating income for 2005 included net restructuring and other credits of $5 million, as compared to net restructuring, divestiture and impairment charges of $22 million in 2004, discussed below. Net revenue for Electronics increased 12.7% in 2004 as compared to 2003, including a 13.1% increase in product revenue and a 2.3% increase in service revenue. The increase in net revenue was primarily a result of growth in existing businesses, specifically, the automotive, computer, consumer electronics, communications and industrial and commercial markets. This growth was partially offset by a decrease in sales of Power Systems products in North America and in our Electrical Contracting Services, which was divested in September 2004. Additionally, favorable changes in foreign currency rates ($560 million) contributed to the increase in net revenue. 38 The 40.9% increase in operating income and the 3.0 percentage point increase in margin in 2004 as compared to 2003 were primarily due to the revenue growth discussed above, cost savings initiatives that were executed in 2003, the positive impact of foreign currency ($90 million) and fewer charges recorded in 2004 as compared to 2003. These increases in operating income were partially offset by an 80 basis point impact of increased metal prices for copper and gold. Operating income for 2004 includes net restructuring, divestiture and impairment charges totaling $22 million. These net charges include a $52 million charge related to the divestiture of the Electrical Contracting Services business, partially offset by $33 million of net restructuring credits related to changes in estimates of severance, facility exit costs, distributor and supplier cancellation fees recorded in prior periods and the impact of the sale of assets that were impaired in prior years for amounts greater than originally anticipated. These net charges also include a $3 million charge related to the impairment of property, plant, and equipment. Operating income and margin for 2003 include net charges totaling $236 million. The $236 million consists primarily of charges for the impairment of goodwill of $278 million in Power Systems, Electrical Contracting Services and the Printed Circuit Group, restructuring credits of $72 million, of which $20 million is included in cost of sales, related primarily to changes in estimates of severance and facility exit costs recorded in prior years and charges for the impairment of long lived assets of $1 million. The net restructuring credit of $72 million includes $55 million of credits, which were changes in estimates recorded in connection with the Companys intensified internal audits and detailed controls and operating reviews performed during 2003. Also included within the $236 million are charges of $14 million related to adjusting asset reserves, $6 million related to the adjustments to accrual balances, and $9 million of reconciliation and other accounting adjustments, which were also recorded in connection with the Companys intensified internal audits and detailed controls and operating reviews performed during 2003. Healthcare The following table sets forth net revenue and operating income and margin for Healthcare for the years ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 ($ in millions): 2005 2004 2003 Revenue from product sales $ 9,477 $ 9,040 $ 8,344 Service revenue 66 70 76 Net revenue $ 9,543 $ 9,110 $ 8,420 Operating income $ 2,286 $ 2,365 $ 2,104 Operating margin 24.0 % 26.0 % 25.0 % Net revenue for Healthcare increased $433 million or 4.8% in 2005 as compared to 2004. This increase resulted primarily from growth in existing businesses and, to a lesser extent, favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates ($141 million). Growth in Healthcares underlying businesses was principally driven by increased revenue within Medical Devices & Supplies which was largely the result of increased sales volume in the International division, primarily in Europe, due to a salesforce investment and sales growth in vessel sealing, laparoscopy, and stapling. Increased sales at the Surgical division within Medical Devices & Supplies also strongly contributed, due to enhanced contracting with group purchasing organizations, increased acceptance of Laparoscopic Gastric By Pass procedures and increased adoption of LigaSure device. Pharmaceuticals also contributed to the increase in revenue, although to a lesser extent. These increases were partially offset by decreased sales in Retail primarily due to a difficult competitive environment and customer consolidations. 39  The decreases in operating income and operating margin in 2005 as compared to 2004 were due primarily to a $277 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005, associated with the adverse decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on a previously disclosed legal matter. (Refer to Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.) This charge, combined with declines in the Retail division as a result of the competitive environment mentioned above as well as increased material and transportation costs, was offset by substantial increases from other divisions, specifically the International and Surgical divisions within Medical Devices & Supplies as well as within Pharmaceutical. Increases in these divisions were due to strong sales growth as mentioned above, combined with a favorable product mix. Also positively impacting the segment were reduced administrative expenses at the segment level, as well as favorable foreign exchange rates ($41 million). In November of 2005, the Mallinckrodt Imaging Division voluntarily recalled two medical imaging products from the market. In each instance, Healthcare was concerned with the procedures that were being used to assure the sterility of each product. Healthcare has not received any reports of adverse events involving patient health or safety with regard to either product. Healthcares Mallinckrodt Imaging Division will not restart the manufacture of the products until all corrective actions have been implemented. Healthcare does not expect that the voluntary recall of these two products in November of 2005 will have a material adverse impact on the Company. Net revenue for Healthcare increased 8.2% in 2004 as compared to 2003. The increase in net revenue resulted primarily from growth in existing businesses as well as favorable foreign currency exchange rates ($292 million). Growth in Healthcares underlying businesses was primarily a result of increased net revenue within Medical Devices & Supplies, and to a lesser extent, at Pharmaceuticals. The increase at Medical Devices & Supplies was largely driven by higher sales volume within our International division, particularly in Europe, due to benefits realized from the sales force investment, back order recovery, growth in Spain and Italy and the absence of an unfavorable $47 million contractual adjustment recorded in 2003. Also contributing to the increase in Medical Devices & Supplies were higher sales within the Medical division resulting primarily from new SharpSafety product launches and gain in market share within the wound care market. The 12.4% increase in operating income in 2004 as compared to 2003 was due primarily to the favorable margin impact of the increased sales discussed above, favorable foreign currency exchanges rates and a continued focus on maximizing operating efficiencies. Operating income was adversely impacted by a $29 million increase in legal liabilities for an ongoing patent infringement suit, and a $59 million increase in research and development costs. Additionally, operating income for 2004 includes net restructuring, divestitures and impairment charges of $18 million, composed of: (i) restructuring charges of $13 million related to the closure of various facilities offset by a credit of $2 million due to costs being less than anticipated; (ii) a $4 million divestiture charge resulting from a loss on the sale of a business and (iii) $3 million of impairment charges related to the closure of various facilities. During 2003, Healthcare recorded net credits totaling $2 million, including restructuring credits of $8 million due to actual costs being less than anticipated, and a credit of $7 million related to an insurance reimbursement for certain legal fees associated with product liability cases. These credits were largely offset by charges of $12 million related to asset reserves for inventory and charges of $1 million for adjustments to accrual balances related to workers compensation, which were changes in estimates recorded in connection with the Companys intensified internal audits, detailed controls and operating reviews and as a result of applying managements judgments and estimates. 40 Engineered Products and Services The following table sets forth net revenue and operating income and margin for Engineered Products and Services for the years ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 ($ in millions): 2005 2004 2003 Revenue from product sales $ 5,137 $ 4,582 $ 3,824 Service revenue 1,319 1,425 674 Net revenue $ 6,456 $ 6,007 $ 4,498 Operating income $ 672 $ 620 $ 362 Operating margin 10.4 % 10.3 % 8.0 % Net revenue for Engineered Products and Services increased $449 million or 7.5% in 2005 as compared to 2004. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by increased selling prices in Electrical and Metal Products due to higher costs of steel and other raw materials. In addition, Flow Control and, to a lesser extent, Tyco Fire & Building Products experienced growth in the industrial and commercial construction markets. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates ($167 million) also contributed to the increase in revenue. The above increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease at Infrastructure Services as a result of a strategic decision to be more selective in bidding for new projects, which will result in fewer but more profitable projects. The increases in operating income and operating margin in 2005 as compared to 2004 were due primarily to increased volume and demand within the industrial and commercial markets, along with the impact of operational excellence initiatives, cost reductions from prior period restructuring programs and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates ($21 million). These increases more than offset the impact of higher raw material costs. Additionally, 2005 operating income includes $1 million of a divestiture credit and $5 million of restructuring charges as compared to the $62 million of net restructuring impairment and divestiture charges in 2004 discussed below. Net revenue for Engineered Products and Services increased $1,509 million or 33.5% in 2004 as compared to 2003, of which $739 million, or 16.4%, represents a change in how we classify certain sub contract and other costs that are paid by Infrastructure Services and re billed to their customers. These costs were historically treated as "pass through" and were therefore not included in reported revenue and cost of revenue and Infrastructure Services. For the year ended September 30, 2004, the company began reflecting these sub contracts costs in both revenue and cost of revenue of Infrastructure Services. The Company has not adjusted revenue or cost of revenue for the year ended September 30, 2003 as such change was not material. Further, such adjustment would have no material impact on previously reported operating income, net income or cash flow. The remaining increase in 2004 net revenue resulted primarily from increased demand and higher selling prices at Tyco Electrical & Metal Products and at Tyco Fire & Building Products and favorable foreign currency exchanges rates in all businesses ($298 million). Further contributing to the increase, although to a much lesser extent, were improved business conditions at Infrastructure Services due primarily to an improved construction market and continued market share growth. Sales remained flat at Flow Control as the impact of lower levels of non residential construction and industrial capital spending, primarily in North America, were offset by improved activity in other end markets and geographic regions. The 71.3% increase in operating income and the 2.3 percentage point increase in margin in 2004 as compared to 2003 were due primarily to increased net revenue discussed above, the impact of cost reduction programs initiated in prior periods and the positive impact of foreign currency ($31 million). 41 These favorable increases were partly offset by the impact of higher raw material costs. Additionally, operating income includes net restructuring, impairment and divestiture charges of $62 million in 2004 compared to $56 million (discussed below) in 2003. Included in the $62 million charge is $53 million of restructuring and $4 million of impairment charges related to the consolidation of manufacturing, distribution and office locations and activities at Flow Control and Infrastructure Services. The remaining $5 million divestiture charge primarily relates to an impairment of goodwill related to the sale of a business. The revenue reclassification at Infrastructure Services discussed above had no impact on operating income for 2004; however, this adjustment lowered 2004 operating margin by 1.5 percentage points. During 2003, we recorded charges totaling $56 million, which includes charges of $32 million related to changes in estimates recorded in connection with the Companys intensified internal audits, detailed controls and operating reviews, and as a result of applying managements judgments and estimates (including $19 million related to adjustments to workers compensation and $13 million associated with asset reserves). These charges also include charges of $8 million, of which a $6 million charge is included in cost of sales, for 2003 restructuring plans partially offset by changes in estimates due to actual costs being less than originally anticipated, charges for the impairment of long lived assets of $2 million relating to manufacturing and distribution consolidation at Flow Control and cost reduction projects, and other costs of $14 million included within selling, general and administrative expenses primarily related to the reorganization and consolidation of a manufacturing facility and certain business offices. Corporate and Other Corporate net revenue was $29 million, $25 million and $14 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which related to the TGN business. Corporate expense was $231 million, $397 million and $1,172 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. During 2005, we recorded a $303 million gain on the sale of the TGN business and TGN operating losses of $54 million. In addition, corporate expenses for 2005 included a $50 million charge representing the best estimate of the amount in fines and penalties that the Company will likely pay to resolve the matters raised in the SEC investigation that commenced in June 2002, as well as a $70 million charge for estimated legacy contingencies related to former executives employment. Corporate expense for 2004 includes net charges of $14 million, which consists of charges for the impairment of long lived assets of $8 million and net restructuring charges of $6 million primarily attributable to severance related to the relocation of the corporate headquarters. Expense also included $73 million of operating losses related to the TGN. Corporate expense for 2003 includes charges totaling $824 million. Included within the $824 million is a charge of $91 million for an incremental increase in directors and officers insurance and charges of $39 million related to internal investigation fees. Also included is a charge of $20 million primarily related to severance and benefits for corporate employees and a restructuring credit of $11 million due to actual costs being less than anticipated, both of which were changes in estimates recorded in connection with the Companys intensified internal audits, detailed controls and operating reviews and as a result of applying managements judgments and estimates. Corporate expense also includes net restructuring credits of $10 million, other net charges of $16 million included in selling, general and administrative expenses, and charges for the impairment of long lived assets of $679 million primarily related to the TGN business and, to a lesser extent, the closure and relocation of corporate offices and related severance and benefits. 42 Interest Income and Expense Interest income was $123 million in 2005, as compared to $91 million and $107 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Interest expense was $815 million in 2005, as compared to $956 million in 2004 and $1,147 million in 2003. The decrease in interest expense in 2005 is primarily driven by lower debt balances, partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates on our interest rate swap program compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in interest expense in 2004 over 2003 is primarily the result of a lower average debt balance in 2004 and the favorable impact of interest rate swap agreements executed during the year. The weighted average rates of interest on total debt outstanding during 2005, 2004 and 2003 were 5.6%, 5.2% and 4.9%, respectively. Other Expense, Net On September 12, 2002, indictments were filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York against Mr. L. Dennis Kozlowski, our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Mark H. Swartz, our former Chief Financial Officer and director (together, the "Defendants"), alleging enterprise corruption, fraud, conspiracy, grand larceny, falsifying certain business records and other crimes. On June 17, 2005, a jury convicted the Defendants on 22 of 23 counts in the indictment. On September 19, 2005, the Defendants were sentenced in New York State Supreme Court to serve eight and one third years to twenty five years in prison and to make joint restitution to the Company in the amount of $134 million, resulting from the larceny convictions. The Court ordered the restitution payment to be made by no later than one year from the date of sentencing. The restitution award is comprised of $109 million of previously expensed compensation made to the defendants and reported as "Other expense, net" in prior years and $25 million related to a loan receivable from one of the Defendants which had been and remains reflected in the Companys consolidated financial statements as a receivable. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company recognized $109 million of income, included in "Other expense, net" in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income. The Defendants have filed a notice of appeal of the convictions. The Company considered the collectibility of the restitution award and assessed the likelihood of the Defendants success upon appeal of the larceny convictions, which, if successful, could result in a change to the restitution order, and has concluded that receipt of the restitution award is probable. During 2005, other expense, net also included losses related to the repurchase of outstanding convertible debt prior to its scheduled maturity of $1,013 million. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding debt repurchases. During 2004, other expense, net consisted primarily of a net loss on the retirement of debt. The Company repurchased $303 million of its 7.2% notes due 2008 for cash of $341 million, which resulted in a $38 million loss, including unamortized debt issuance costs, on the retirement of debt. Additionally, the Company repurchased $517 million of its outstanding 2.75% convertible senior debentures with a 2008 put option. The total purchase price paid was $750 million and the repurchase resulted in a $241 million loss on the retirement of debt, including the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs. During 2003, other expense, net consisted primarily of a net loss on the retirement of debt of $128 million and a loss relating to the write down of various investments of $87 million. The value of the investments were reduced when it became evident that the declines in the fair value of the investments were other than temporary, predominately due to the continuing depressed economic conditions, specifically within the telecommunications industry. 43 Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 23.5%, 27.5% and 45.2% for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 2004 to 2005 is primarily the result of the release of valuation allowances, benefits realized related to the TGN divestiture, as well as the court ordered restitution award related to certain former executives for which there is no tax obligation and, to a lesser extent, increased profitability in operations in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. This decrease is partially offset by an increase in charges for which no tax benefit is available such as the loss on retirement of debt, asset impairments and the estimated settlement of the SEC enforcement action. The change in the effective tax rate from 2003 to 2004 was primarily the result of increased profitability in operations primarily in jurisdictions with lower tax rates and a decrease in nondeductible charges. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $1,867 million and $1,967 million at September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109 which requires a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is "more likely than not" that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by these taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as payment is not expected within one year. The Company and its subsidiaries income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. The Company is currently under audit by the IRS for the years 1997 to 2000. In connection with such examinations, certain tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax deficiencies. The Company is reviewing the issues raised by the tax authorities and is contesting certain proposed tax deficiencies. Amounts related to these tax deficiencies and other tax contingencies that management has assessed as probable and estimable have been recorded through the income tax provision. In connection with the IRS audits for the years 1997 to 2000, the Company prepared proposed amendments to these prior period U.S. federal income tax returns resulting in a reduction in the taxable income previously reported. The IRS is currently reviewing the proposed amendments. The Company has not recorded the impact of the proposed amendments, pending the completion of the IRS review. The proposed amendments, if accepted, will result in receipt of refunds or credits and a corresponding reduction to the deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company may prepare proposed amendments to prior period U.S. federal income tax returns for additional periods. The proposed amendments are not expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 44 Except for earnings that are currently distributed, no additional provision has been made for U.S. or non U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or the Company has concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of distribution of such earnings. A liability could arise if amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries. Discontinued Operations and Divestitures Discontinued Operations In May 2005, Tyco announced its intent to explore the divestiture of its Plastics and Adhesives business segment, a global manufacturer of plastic film, specialty tapes and adhesives, coated products and garment hangers. During the third quarter of 2005, as a result of consideration for potential sale and deteriorating operating results in the A&E Products business, the Company performed an interim assessment of the recoverability of both goodwill and long lived assets in the Plastics and Adhesives segment. Estimated fair values of the reporting units and long lived assets at Plastics and Adhesives were developed based on probability weighted expected future cash flows of these assets. As a result of this assessment, the Company determined that the book value of certain long lived assets in the A&E Products reporting unit of Plastics and Adhesives was greater than their estimated fair value and consequently recorded a long lived asset impairment of $40 million. The Company also determined that the book value of the A&E Products reporting unit was in excess of its estimated fair value which resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of $162 million. At September 30, 2005, the Plastics and Adhesives segment met the held for sale criteria and its results of operations have been included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. The Company is negotiating a sales agreement with potential buyers and expects to complete a sale transaction in 2006. The Company has assessed the recoverability of the segments carrying value at September 30, 2005 and will continue to assess recoverability based on current fair values, less cost to sell, until the businesses are sold. Depending on the outcome of the sale negotiations, the Company may incur additional impairment charges. During 2005, the Company divested eight businesses which were reported as discontinued operations within Fire and Security, Plastics and Adhesives and Engineered Products and Services. The Company reported losses on sale or additional impairments to write the carrying value of such assets down to their estimated fair value of $56 million ($55 million after tax) during 2005. During 2004, the Company reported losses on the sale of discontinued operations of $132 million, of which $36 million related to goodwill impairments, to write the carrying value of such assets down to their fair value, less cost to sell. (Gains) losses and impairments on divestitures, net During 2003, the Company conducted a comprehensive review of its core businesses, and as a result, implemented a divestiture program in early 2004. During 2004, in connection with the program, the Company divested twenty one and liquidated four non core businesses across all business segments primarily within Fire and Security. During 2004, the Company recorded net losses and impairments on divestitures of $116 million (including $60 million of goodwill impairment charges) in continuing operations in connection with the divestiture or write down to fair value of certain held for sale businesses. 45  In November 2004, Tyco agreed to sell the TGN, its undersea fiber optic telecommunication network. The sale was consummated on June 30, 2005. As part of the sale transaction, Tyco received gross cash proceeds of $130 million, and the purchaser assumed certain liabilities. In connection with this sale, Tyco recorded a $303 million pre tax gain which is reflected in (gains) losses and impairments on divestitures in the Consolidated Statement of Income for 2005. The Company has presented the operations of the TGN in continuing operations as the criteria for discontinued operations were not met. During 2005, the Company divested ten businesses that were reported as continuing operations in Fire and Security, Healthcare and Engineered Products and Services. The Company recorded net losses and impairments on divestitures of $32 million, including a $3 million charge reflected in cost of sales, in connection with the divestiture and liquidation of these businesses, as well as the write down to estimated fair value of certain held for sale businesses. Acquisitions In 2005, Surgical, a division in Tycos Healthcare segment, acquired Vivant Medical Inc. ("Vivant"), a developer of microwave ablation medical technology. The transaction is valued at approximately $66 million cash, with up to approximately $35 million additional cash to be paid in the future based on the achievement of certain milestones. The acquisition of Vivant strengthens Healthcares surgical product portfolio. During 2004, the Company completed the acquisition of two businesses within Engineered Products and Services and Fire and Security for an aggregate cost of $9 million. During 2003, the Company purchased seven businesses within Healthcare, Engineered Products and Services, Fire and Security and Electronics for an aggregate cost of $44 million in cash, net of $1 million of cash acquired. These acquisitions were funded utilizing cash from operations. The results of operations of the acquired companies have been included in Tycos consolidated results from the respective acquisition dates. These acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change During 2005, the Company changed the measurement date for its pension and postretirement benefit plans, from September 30th to August 31st. The Company believes that the one month change of measurement date is a preferable change as it allows management adequate time to evaluate and report the actuarial information in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements under the accelerated reporting deadlines. In conjunction with this change, the Company recorded a $21 million after tax gain ($28 million pre tax) cumulative effect adjustment. Refer to Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on retirement plans. During 2003, the Company adopted FIN No. 46, which requires identification of the Companys participation in Variable Interest Entities (VIEs), which are entities with a level of invested equity that is not sufficient to fund future activities to permit them to operate on a stand alone basis, or whose equity holders lack certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest. For entities identified as VIEs, FIN No. 46 sets forth a model to evaluate potential consolidation based on an assessment of which party to VIEs, if any, bears a majority of the risk to its expected losses, or stands to gain from a majority of its expected returns. The Company has programs under which it sells machinery and equipment to investors who, in turn, purchase and receive ownership and security interests in those assets. As such, the Company may have certain investments in those affiliated companies whereby it provides varying degrees of financial 46 support and where the investors are entitled to a share in the results of those entities, but the Company does not consolidate these entities. While these entities may be substantive operating companies, they have been evaluated for potential consolidation under FIN No. 46. The Company had three synthetic lease programs utilized, to some extent, by all of the Companys segments to finance capital expenditures for manufacturing machinery and equipment and for ships used by Tyco Submarine Telecommunications. During 2003, the Company restructured one of the synthetic leases to meet the requirements of FIN No. 46 for off balance sheet accounting. The Company reclassified the remaining two leases as capital leases and, consequently, recorded a $75 million after tax loss ($115 million pre tax) cumulative effect adjustment. One of the capital leases expired in December 2004 and the other is scheduled to expire in July 2006. Change in Fiscal Year and Reporting Calendar Alignment Effective October 1, 2004, Tyco changed its fiscal year end from a calendar fiscal year ending September 30 to a "52 53 week" year ending on the last Friday of September, such that each quarterly period will be 13 weeks in length. For fiscal years in which there are 53 weeks, the fourth quarter reporting period will be 14 weeks, with the first such occurrence taking place in fiscal 2011. In addition, certain of the Companys subsidiaries consistently closed their books up to one month prior to the Companys fiscal period end. These subsidiaries now report results for the same period as the reported results of the consolidated Company. The impact of this change is not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This change is also consistent with the Companys ongoing efforts to enhance controls and improve the transparency of its reporting, as this change better aligns the Companys external reporting with the Companys internal operational processes. Net income for the transition period related to this change was $26 million and was reported within Shareholders Equity.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. Depreciation and Amortization Method for Security Monitoring Systems Tyco generally considers its electronic security assets in three asset pools: internally generated residential systems, internally generated commercial systems and customer accounts acquired through the ADT dealer program. The determination of the depreciable lives of subscriber systems, as defined below, included in property, plant and equipment, and the amortizable lives of customer contracts and related customer relationships included in intangible assets, are primarily based on historical attrition rates, third party lifing studies and the useful life of the underlying tangible asset. The realizable value and remaining useful lives of these assets could be impacted by changes in customer attrition rates. If the attrition rates were to rise, Tyco may be required to accelerate the depreciation and amortization. With respect to Tycos depreciation policy for security monitoring systems installed in residential and commercial customer premises, the costs of these systems are combined in separate pools for internally generated residential and internally generated commercial account customers (collectively "subscriber systems"), and generally depreciated over ten to fourteen years. Tyco concluded that for residential and commercial account pools the straight line method of depreciation over a ten to fourteen year period continues to be appropriate given the observed actual attrition data for these pools. Tyco purchases residential security monitoring contracts from an external network of independent dealers who operate under the ADT dealer program. The purchase price of these customer contracts is recorded as an intangible asset (i.e., contracts and related customer relationships). 47  Intangible assets arising from the ADT dealer program are amortized in pools determined by the month of contract acquisition on an accelerated basis over the period and pattern of economic benefit that is expected to be obtained from the customer relationship. Tyco believes that the accelerated method that presently best achieves the matching objective described above is the double declining balance method based on a ten year life for the first eight years of the estimated life of the customer relationships converting to the straight line method of amortization for the remaining four years of the estimated relationship period. Actual attrition data is regularly reviewed in order to assess the continued applicability of the accelerated method of amortization described above. Attrition rates for customers in our Global Electronic Security Services business were 14.8%, 15.1% and 15.9% on a trailing 12 month basis for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Revenue Recognition Contract sales for the installation of fire protection systems, large security intruder systems, undersea cable systems and other construction related projects are recorded primarily on the percentage of completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon contracted revenue and related estimated cost to completion. The risk of this methodology is its dependence upon estimates of costs to completion, which are subject to the uncertainties inherent in long term contracts. Revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they first become determinable. If estimates are inaccurate, there is risk that our revenue and profits for the period may be overstated or understated. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other markets participants. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience and trend analysis. Loss Contingencies Accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings, self insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on managements judgment, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates. Additionally, the Company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. Income Taxes In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. Deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and international pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income. Any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant 48 impact on our future earnings. If a change in a valuation allowance occurs, which was established in connection with an acquisition, such adjustment may impact goodwill rather than the income tax provision. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such charges that would have a material effect on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If the tax liabilities relate to tax uncertainties existing at the date of the acquisition of a business, the adjustment of such tax liabilities will result in an adjustment to the goodwill recorded at the date of acquisition. Goodwill In performing the goodwill assessments, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. Since managements judgment is involved in performing goodwill valuation analyses, there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated or understated. We elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for all reporting units. Goodwill valuations have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. This approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors and income tax rates. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in a goodwill impairment in future periods. Disruptions to our business such as end market conditions and protracted economic weakness, unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units, the divestiture of a significant component of a reporting unit and market capitalization declines may result in our having to perform a goodwill impairment first step valuation analysis for some or all of our reporting units prior to the required annual assessment. These types of events and the resulting analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future. The Company recorded goodwill impairments of $162 million in 2005, included in (loss) income from discontinued operations, and $96 million in 2004, of which $36 million is included in (loss) income from discontinued operations and the remaining $60 million is included in (gains) losses and impairments on divestitures, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Goodwill impairments in 2003 totaled $278 million. Long Lived Assets Assets held and used by the Company, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of evaluating the recoverability of long lived assets to be held and used, a recoverability test is performed based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk. Impairments to long lived assets to be disposed of are recorded based upon the fair value of the applicable assets. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of long lived assets, there is a risk that the carrying value of our long lived assets may be overstated or understated. 49  Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes the sources of our cash flow from operating activities and the use of a portion of that cash in our operations for the years ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 ($ in millions): 2005 2004 2003 Cash flows from operating activities: Operating income $ 5,795 $ 5,236 $ 2,877 Non cash restructuring and other credits, net (18 ) (33 ) (46 ) Impairment of long lived assets 6 51 825 (Gains) losses and impairments on divestitures, net (271 ) 111 Goodwill impairment 278 Depreciation and amortization(1) 2,100 2,119 2,142 Deferred income taxes (41 ) 167 367 Provision for losses on accounts receivable and inventory 234 318 573 Debt and refinancing cost amortization 30 55 116 Other, net(2) 200 78 96 Net (increase) decrease in working capital (204 ) 94 (344 ) Decrease in sale of accounts receivable (18 ) (929 ) (119 ) Interest income 123 91 107 Interest expense (815 ) (956 ) (1,147 ) Income tax expense (984 ) (1,123 ) (729 ) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 6,137 $ 5,279 $ 4,996 Other cash flow items: Capital expenditures, net(3) $ (1,272 ) $ (987 ) $ (1,255 ) Decrease in sale of accounts receivable 18 929 119 Acquisition of customer accounts (ADT dealer program) (328 ) (254 ) (597 ) Cash paid for purchase accounting and holdback/earn out liabilities (47 ) (105 ) (267 ) Voluntary pension contributions 115 567 205 (1)Includes depreciation expense of $1,447 million, $1,428 million and $1,420 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively and amortization of intangible assets ($653 million, $691 million and $722 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively). (2)Includes the add back of net losses on the retirement of debt of $1,013 million, $284 million and $128 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. (3)Includes net proceeds of $94 million, $141 million and $124 million received for the sale/disposition of property, plant and equipment in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The net change in total working capital was a cash decrease of $204 million in 2005. The significant changes in working capital included a $714 million increase in accounts receivable offset by an increase of $424 million in accounts payable. The provision for losses on accounts receivable and inventory decreased from $318 million during the year ended September 30, 2004 to $234 million for the current period. This decrease was largely the result of improved accounts receivable aging due to an overall improved credit profile of the customer base, particularly in the Fire and Security Segment, and better collections. Additionally, our allowance for doubtful accounts decreased from $516 million at September 30, 2004 to $422 million at September 30, 2005 primarily due to the write off of fully reserved receivables and improved aging of accounts receivable at Fire and Security. The change in the inventory provision also contributed to the decrease, however to a much lesser extent. 50  Cash flows from operating activities and other cash flow items by segment were as follows for the year ended September 30, 2005 ($ in millions): Fire and Security Electronics Healthcare Engineered Products and Services Corporate and Other Total Cash flows from operating activities: Operating income (loss) $ 1,216 $ 1,852 $ 2,286 $ 672 $ (231 ) $ 5,795 Restructuring, impairment and other (credits) charges, net (11 ) 3 2 (6 ) (12 ) Non cash losses and impairments on divestitures, net 18 8 (1 ) (296 ) (271 ) Depreciation 582 491 262 104 8 1,447 Intangible assets amortization 524 68 57 4 653 Depreciation and amortization 1,106 559 319 108 8 2,100 Deferred income taxes (41 ) (41 ) Provision for losses on accounts receivable and inventory 71 84 41 38 234 Debt and refinancing cost amortization 30 30 Net (increase) decrease in working capital and other(1) (277 ) (311 ) 236 (88 ) 436 (4 ) Decrease in sale of accounts receivable (8 ) (1 ) (9 ) (18 ) Interest income 123 123 Interest expense (815 ) (815 ) Income tax expense (984 ) (984 ) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,126 $ 2,172 $ 2,884 $ 731 $ (1,776 ) $ 6,137 Other cash flow items: Capital expenditures, net $ (389 ) $ (458 ) $ (326 ) $ (88 ) $ (11 ) $ (1,272 ) Decrease in sale of accounts receivable 8 1 9 18 Acquisition of customer accounts (ADT dealer program) (328 ) (328 ) Cash paid for purchase accounting and holdback/earn out liabilities (10 ) (18 ) (14 ) (5 ) (47 ) Voluntary pension contributions 82 25 8 115 (1)Includes the add back of $1,013 million related to a loss on the retirement of debt. During 2005, 2004 and 2003 we paid out $161 million, $228 million and $499 million, respectively, in cash related to restructuring activities. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our restructuring activities. We anticipate a cash outflow of approximately $50 million in 2006 related to restructuring activities in our Electronics segment. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, Tyco paid $328 million, $254 million and $597 million of cash, respectively, to acquire 0.4 million, 0.3 million and 0.6 million customer contracts for electronic security services through the ADT dealer program. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, we paid $47 million, $105 million and $267 million, respectively, in cash for purchase accounting and holdback/earn out liabilities. Holdback liabilities represent a portion of the purchase price that is withheld from the seller pending finalization of the acquisition balance sheet. Certain acquisitions have provisions which require Tyco to make additional "earn out" payments to the sellers if the acquired company achieves certain milestones subsequent to its acquisition by Tyco. These earn out payments are tied to certain performance measures, such as revenue, gross margin or earnings growth. At September 30, 2005 holdback/earn out liabilities on our Consolidated Balance 51 Sheets were $148 million, of which $79 million are included in accrued and other current liabilities and $69 million are included in other liabilities. At September 30, 2005, the acquisition liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets were $70 million, of which $24 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and $46 million is included in other liabilities. During 2005, the Company sold various businesses for aggregate net proceeds of $295 million of which $120 million relates to the TGN business. The purchaser of the TGN also assumed certain liabilities. In 2005, Surgical, a division of Tycos Healthcare segment, acquired Vivant, a developer of microwave ablation medical technology. The transaction is valued at approximately $66 million cash, with up to approximately $35 million additional cash to be paid in the future based on the achievement of certain milestones. Additionally, in November 2005, Tycos Healthcare segment acquired a controlling interest in Floreane Medical Implants, a manufacturer of surgical mesh products. Both of these transactions strengthen Healthcares surgical product portfolio. We continue to fund capital expenditures to improve the cost structure of our businesses, to invest in new processes and technology, and to maintain high quality production standards. Capital spending increased to $1.3 billion in 2005 from $1.0 billion in 2004. The level of capital expenditures is not expected to exceed depreciation in 2006 and is expected to increase slightly relative to the level of spending in 2005. The amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during the year was $790 million. During the first half of 2006, we expect cash outflows of approximately $500 million for resolution of certain previously accrued legal and legacy matters including a patent dispute in the Healthcare segment, an SEC enforcement action and certain holdback liabilities. Capitalization Shareholders equity was $32.5 billion or $16.10 per share, at September 30, 2005, compared to $30.3 billion or $15.07 per share, at September 30, 2004. This increase was due primarily to net income of $3.0 billion and share options exercised of $351 million. These increases were partially offset by dividends declared of $805 million, the repurchase of shares of $300 million, and an increase in the minimum pension liability of $200 million, net of income taxes. At September 30, 2005, total debt decreased $4.0 billion to $12.6 billion, as compared to $16.6 billion at September 30, 2004. Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization (total debt and shareholders equity) was 28% at September 30, 2005 and 35% at September 30, 2004. The decrease in debt resulted principally from our repurchase of convertible debentures as discussed below ($2.0 billion) and scheduled repayments of debentures ($1.8 billion). Our cash balance decreased to $3.2 billion at September 30, 2005, as compared to $4.5 billion at September 30, 2004. The decrease in cash was primarily due to the convertible debt repurchases and scheduled debt repayments referred to above. Capital expenditures, and to a lesser extent, dividend payments and acquisition of customer accounts, also contributed to the cash decrease. Furthermore, the Company used $300 million of cash to repurchase shares in the open market in connection with the $1.5 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in July 2005. These decreases were partially offset by cash flows from operations. On December 16, 2004, Tyco International Group S.A., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company organized under the laws of Luxembourg ("TIGSA"), entered into a $1.0 billion 5 year revolving credit facility expiring on December 16, 2009. This facility replaced TIGSAs $1.0 billion 364 day revolving credit facility, which was terminated prior to its scheduled expiration date of December 20, 2004. There 52 were no amounts outstanding under the 364 day revolving credit facility on the date of its termination. TIGSA also holds a $1.5 billion 3 year revolving bank credit facility expiring on December 22, 2006 and a $500 million 3 year unsecured letter of credit facility expiring on June 15, 2007. At September 30, 2005, letters of credit in the amount of $488 million have been issued under the $500 million facility and a remaining $12 million is available for issuance. There were no amounts borrowed under any of these facilities. In 2005, the Company repurchased $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 2.75% convertible senior debentures due 2018 with a 2008 put option for cash of $1.8 billion and $750 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 3.125% convertible senior debentures due 2023 with a 2015 put option for cash of $1.1 billion. These repurchases resulted in a $1.0 billion loss on the retirement of debt, including the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs, which is reflected in other expense, net, in the Consolidated Statement of Income. We plan to use available cash to continue to fund internal growth and cost reduction opportunities within our businesses. Additionally, we believe that our cash flow generation capability will allow us to continue to strengthen our balance sheet and return capital to shareholders. While debt reduction and share repurchases are our focus in the near term, we will also consider appropriate acquisitions should the opportunity arise. The Companys bank credit agreements contain a number of financial covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and minimum levels of net worth, and limits on the incurrence of liens. At September 30, 2005, the Company had two remaining synthetic lease facilities, of which one will expire in July of 2006, with other covenants, including interest coverage and leverage ratios. The Companys outstanding indentures contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges, subsidiary debt and sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants is presently considered restrictive to the Companys operations. The Company is currently in compliance with all of its debt covenants. In 2005, we made voluntary contributions to our pension plans totaling approximately $115 million. On December 9, 2004, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend on our common shares from $0.0125 to $0.10 per share. As a result, dividend payments were $628 million in 2005 and are expected to approximate $800 million in 2006. The following table details the trend of our debt ratings: At September 30, 2005 At September 30, 2004 Short Term Long Term Short Term Long Term Moodys Prime 3 Baa 3 Prime 3 Baa3 Standard & Poors A2 BBB+ A2 BBB Fitch F2 BBB+ F2 BBB+ On August 3, 2005, Standard & Poors Rating Services raised the corporate credit and senior unsecured ratings for Tyco International Ltd. and subsidiaries to BBB+ from BBB. The security ratings set forth above are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 53 Commitments and Contingencies Contractual Obligations A summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for debt, minimum lease payment obligations under non cancelable operating leases and other obligations at September 30, 2005 is as follows ($ in millions): 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Debt(1) $ 1,954 $ 759 $ 1,383 $ 1,734 $ 19 $ 6,705 Operating leases(2) 583 449 344 248 165 548 Purchase obligations(3) 183 29 20 9 9 28 Total contractual cash obligations(4) $ 2,720 $ 1,237 $ 1,747 $ 1,991 $ 193 $ 7,281 (1)Includes capital lease obligations and excludes interest. (2)Includes obligations under an off balance sheet leasing arrangement under which a subsidiary of the Company has the option to buy five cable laying sea vessels (see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). (3)Purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of good and services. (4)Minimum pension funding requirements are not included as such amounts have not been determined for all periods presented. The minimum required contributions to our pension plans are expected to be approximately $118 million in 2006. At September 30, 2005, the Company had outstanding letters of credit and letters of guarantee in the amount of $1.4 billion. At September 30, 2005, TIGSA had unsecured credit facilities of $1.5 billion due December 22, 2006, and $1.0 billion due December 16, 2009, both of which were undrawn and available (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, certain of the Companys operating subsidiaries have overdraft and similar types of facilities, which total $605 million, of which $599 million was undrawn and available at September 30, 2005. These facilities expire at various dates through the year 2013, most of which are renewable and are established primarily within our international operations. At September 30, 2005, the Company had a contingent purchase price liability of $80 million related to the 2001 acquisition of Com Net by Electronics. This represents the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of Com Net only after the construction and installation of a communications system for the State of Florida is finished and the State has approved the system based on the guidelines set forth in the contract. A liability for this contingency has not been recorded in Tycos Consolidated Financial Statements as the outcome of this contingency cannot be reasonably determined. In June 2004, TIGSA entered into a $500 million 3 year unsecured letter of credit facility. The facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit, supported by a related line of credit facility. TIGSA may only borrow under the line of credit agreement to reimburse the bank for obligations with respect to letters of credit issued under this facility. The covenants under this facility are substantially similar to TIGSAs bank credit facilities entered into during December 2003 and the indenture related to TIGSAs 6% notes due 2013 issued in November 2003. TIGSA would pay interest on any outstanding borrowings at a variable interest rate, based on the banks base rate or the Eurodollar rate, as defined. Upon the occurrence of certain credit events, the interest rate on the outstanding borrowings becomes fixed. The issuance of letters of credit under this facility during 2004 enabled the Company to release approximately $480 million of restricted cash and investments. As of September 30, 2005, letters of credit in the amount of $488 million have been issued under the $500 million facility 54 and a remaining $12 million is available for issuance. There were no amounts borrowed under any of these facilities. In the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Legal Matters Class Actions For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos securities class actions, shareholder derivative litigation, ERISA litigation and investigation, and litigation against our former senior management, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings. We are generally obligated to indemnify our directors and officers and our former directors and officers who are named as defendants in some or all of these matters to the extent required by Bermuda law. In addition, our insurance carriers may decline coverage, or our coverage may be insufficient to cover our expenses and liability, in some or all of these matters. We are unable at this time to estimate what our ultimate liability in these matters may be, and it is possible that we will be required to pay judgments or settlements and incur expenses, in excess of any insurance coverage, in aggregate amounts that would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or probable losses, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters. Investigation For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to governmental investigations related to Tyco see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Subpoenas and Document Requests From Governmental Entities. We cannot predict when these investigations will be completed, nor can we predict what the results of these investigations may be. It is possible that we will be required to pay material fines, consent to injunctions on future conduct, lose the ability to conduct business with government instrumentalities (which in turn could negatively impact our business with non governmental customers) or suffer other penalties, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. It is not possible to estimate the amount of loss, or range of possible loss, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters. In 2005, the Company recorded a charge of $50 million, which represents the Companys best estimate of the amount in fines and penalties management believes the Company will likely pay to resolve the matters raised in the SECs investigation. The Company is engaged in discussions with the SECs Division of Enforcement to resolve the matters raised in the SECs investigation. Final resolution of these matters is subject to a number of uncertainties, including finalizing the terms of a settlement that the Enforcement Staff will agree to recommend to the Commission, the Companys submission of an offer of settlement approved by the Tyco Board of Directors, and the Commissions approval of the settlement offer. Until such events have occurred, the charge is subject to change. Intellectual Property Litigation For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos intellectual property litigation, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Intellectual Property Litigation. Environmental Matters For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos environmental matters, see Item 1. Business Environmental Matters. 55  Asbestos Matters Tyco and some of its subsidiaries are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials. Consistent with the national trend of increased asbestos related litigation, the Company has observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits in the past several years. The majority of these cases have been filed against subsidiaries in Healthcare and Engineered Products and Services. A limited number of the cases allege premises liability, based on claims that individuals were exposed to asbestos while on a subsidiarys property. A majority of the cases involve product liability claims, based principally on allegations of past distribution of heat resistant industrial products incorporating asbestos or the past distribution of industrial valves that incorporated asbestos containing gaskets or packing. Each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants. Tycos involvement in asbestos cases has been limited because its subsidiaries did not mine or produce asbestos. Furthermore, in the Companys experience, a large percentage of these claims were never substantiated and have been dismissed by the courts. The Company will continue to vigorously defend these lawsuits and the Company has not suffered an adverse verdict in a trial court proceeding related to asbestos claims. When appropriate, the Company settles claims; however, the total amount paid to date to settle and defend all asbestos claims has been immaterial. As of September 30, 2005, there were approximately 14,000 asbestos liability cases pending against the Company and its subsidiaries. During the 2005, the Company undertook a detailed study of its pending asbestos claims and also developed an estimate of asbestos claims that were incurred but not reported, as well as related insurance and indemnification recoveries. The impact of this study was not material to the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Companys estimate of the liability for pending and future claims is based on claim experience over the past five years and covers claims expected to be filed through 2012. The Company believes that it has adequate amounts recorded related to these matters. While it is not possible at this time to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome of these asbestos related proceedings, the Company believes that the final outcome of all known and anticipated future claims, after taking into account its substantial indemnification rights and insurance coverage, will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Income Taxes Tyco and its subsidiaries income tax returns are periodically examined by various regulatory tax authorities. In connection with such examinations, tax authorities, including the United States Internal Revenue Service, have raised issues and proposed tax deficiencies. The Company is reviewing the issues raised by the tax authorities and is contesting certain of the proposed tax deficiencies. Amounts related to these tax deficiencies and other tax contingencies that management has assessed as probable and estimable have been recorded through the income tax provision, equity or goodwill, as applicable. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "AJCA"), signed into law in October 2004, replaces an export incentive with a deduction from domestic manufacturing income. It is not expected that the AJCA will have a material impact on the Companys income tax provision. The AJCA also allows the Company to repatriate up to $500 million of permanently reinvested foreign earnings in 2006 at an effective tax rate of 5.25%. This incentive would apply to the Companys U.S. owned controlled foreign companies. The Company continues to review whether to take advantage of this provision of the AJCA. 56 Compliance Matters In 2003 an allegation was brought to our attention that during the period from 1999 through 2003 certain improper payments were made by a non U.S. subsidiary of Tyco with 2004 revenue of $40 million. With the assistance of outside counsel, we conducted an internal investigation into this allegation to determine whether certain payments were correctly recorded in the books and records of the subsidiary. We have taken remedial steps and have reported the results of our investigation to the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the SEC. We are cooperating with their inquiries. On March 29, 2005 and August 9, 2005, Tyco reported to the DOJ and the SEC the investigative steps and remedial measures that it has taken in response to a number of recent allegations of improper payments. Tyco also informed the DOJ and the SEC that it has retained outside counsel to perform a company wide baseline review of its policies, controls and practices with respect to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, that it would continue to make periodic progress reports to them, and that it would present its factual findings upon conclusion of the baseline review. At this time, Tyco cannot predict the outcome of its disclosures of these matters reported to regulatory and law enforcement authorities and therefore cannot estimate the range of potential loss or extent of risk, if any, that may result from an adverse resolution of any or all of these matters. Other Matters The Company is a defendant in a number of other pending legal proceedings incidental to present and former operations, acquisitions and dispositions. The Company does not expect the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Backlog At September 30, 2005, we had a backlog of unfilled orders of $13.6 billion, compared to a backlog of $13.0 billion at September 30, 2004. We expect that approximately 75% of our backlog at September 30, 2005 will be filled during 2006. Backlog by reportable industry segment at September 30 is as follows ($ in millions): 2005 2004 Fire and Security $ 6,732 $ 6,726 Engineered Products and Services 4,007 3,469 Electronics 2,591 2,454 Healthcare 272 280 Corporate and Other(1) 120 $ 13,602 $ 13,049 (1)2004 includes the TGN business which was classified as held for sale at September 30, 2004 and sold during 2005. Within Fire and Security, backlog remained flat in part due to increased bookings within Fire Protection in North America, offset by the continued recognition of deferred revenues on leased security systems as a result of the transition to a direct consumer sales model in 2003. Backlog for Fire and Security includes recurring revenue in force, which represents twelve months fees for monitoring and maintenance services under contract in the security business. The amount of recurring revenue in force at September 30, 2005 and September 30, 2004 was $3,550 million and $3,559 million, respectively. Within Engineered Products and Services, backlog increased at Infrastructure Services as a result of projects in Venezuela and Canada, as well as expanding sectors in Flow Control Asia and North America. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates also contributed to the increase. 57 Within Electronics, backlog increased primarily due to stronger orders from improving business conditions across the majority of its end markets. Backlog in Healthcare represents unfilled orders, which, in the nature of the businesses, are normally shipped shortly after purchase orders are received. We do not view backlog in Healthcare to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale of Accounts Receivable Tyco utilized several programs under which it sold participating interests in accounts receivable to investors who, in turn, purchased and received ownership and security interests in those receivables. As collections reduced accounts receivable included in the pool, the Company sold new receivables. The Company retained the risk of credit loss on the receivables and, accordingly, the full amount of the reserve was retained on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The proceeds from the sales were used to repay short term and long term borrowings and for working capital and other corporate purposes and were reported as operating cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The sale proceeds were less than the face amount of accounts receivable sold by an amount that approximated the cost that would have been incurred if commercial paper had been issued backed by these accounts receivable. The discount from the face amount is accounted for as a loss on the sale of receivables and has been included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Such discount aggregated $18 million and $29 million, or 3.1% and 3.5% of the weighted average balance of the receivables outstanding, during 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company retained collection and administrative responsibilities for the participating interests in the defined pool. During 2004, the Company reduced outstanding balances under its accounts receivable programs by $929 million, of which $812 million related to three of its corporate accounts receivable programs which were terminated in 2005. No amounts were utilized under these programs at September 30, 2004 and through the date of termination. The remaining reduction of $117 million related to certain of the Companys international businesses selling fewer accounts receivable as a short term financing mechanism. These transactions qualify as true sales. The aggregate amount outstanding under international accounts receivable programs was $80 million and $99 million at September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Variable Interest Entities The Company has programs under which it sells machinery and equipment to investors who, in turn, purchase and receive ownership and security interests in those assets. As such, the Company may have certain investments in those affiliated companies whereby it provides varying degrees of financial support and where the investors are entitled to a share in the results of those entities but do not consolidate these entities. While these entities may be substantive operating companies, they have been evaluated for potential consolidation under FIN No. 46. The Company had three synthetic lease programs utilized, to some extent, by all of the Companys segments to finance capital expenditures for manufacturing machinery and equipment and for ships used by Tyco Submarine Telecommunications. During 2003 the Company restructured one of the synthetic leases to meet the requirements of FIN No. 46 for off balance sheet accounting. In 2003 in conjunction with adopting FIN No. 46, the Company also evaluated other investments and concluded that four joint ventures that were previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting within Tyco Infrastructure Services, in which we own a minority interest, met the consolidation criteria set forth in FIN No. 46. Accordingly, these ventures were consolidated onto the Companys balance sheet effective July 1, 2003, and were subsequently deconsolidated as of March 31, 2004 upon the adoption of FIN No. 46R. 58 Guarantees Certain of the Companys business segments have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from 2006 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In disposing of assets or businesses, the Company often provides representations, warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. The Company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the Company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows. The Company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item I. Business Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. The Company has guaranteed the fair value of certain vessels not to exceed $235 million, and as of September 30, 2005 expects the obligation to be $54 million, which is recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet, based on its estimate of the fair value of the vessels (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources Contractual Obligations" above). In the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company generally records estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. For further information on estimated product warranty, see Notes 1 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Accounting Pronouncements In September 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") reached a consensus on EITF No. 04 8, "The Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted Earnings per Share." This EITF requires that contingently convertible debt securities with a market price trigger be included in diluted earnings per share, regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met. EITF No. 04 8 became effective for Tyco on October 1, 2004 and required retroactive restatement of previously reported earnings per share. The adoption of this EITF did not impact diluted earnings per share for any period presented. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4." SFAS No. 151 amends Accounting Research Bulletin ("ARB") No. 43, Chapter 4, to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials (spoilage) should be recognized as current period charges. In addition, SFAS No. 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No. 151 will be effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 for Tyco. The adoption of SFAS No. 151 is not expected to have a significant impact on the Companys results of its operations, financial position or cash flows. 59 In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R which requires all share based payments to employees to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. SFAS No. 123R replaces SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 ("APB Opinion No. 25"), "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." Effective October 1, 2005, Tyco adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective method. Under this method compensation expense is recorded for all unvested options over the related vesting period beginning in the quarter of adoption. The Company previously applied the intrinsic value based method prescribed in APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting for employee stock based compensation. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company will recognize stock based compensation costs ratably over the service period, which is the earlier of the retirement eligibility date, if the grant contains provisions such that the award becomes fully vested upon retirement, or the stated vesting period. For grants issued to retirement eligible employees prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company will recognize compensation costs over the stated vesting period with acceleration of any unrecognized compensation costs if and when an employee elects to retire. This statement also amends SFAS No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows," to require that excess tax benefits be reflected as financing cash inflows rather than operating cash inflows. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R is estimated to result in a compensation charge for fiscal year 2006 in the range of approximately $0.06 to $0.07 per diluted share. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 107 regarding the Staffs interpretation of SFAS No. 123R. This interpretation provides the Staffs views regarding interactions between SFAS No. 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of share based payments for public companies. The interpretive guidance is intended to assist companies in applying the provisions of SFAS No. 123R and investors and users of the financial statements in analyzing the information provided. The Company will follow the guidance prescribed in SAB No. 107 in connection with its adoption of SFAS No. 123R. In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation ("FIN") No. 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143." This Interpretation clarifies the timing of liability recognition for legal obligations associated with an asset retirement when the timing and (or) method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN No. 47 is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. The Company is currently assessing the impact that FIN No. 47 will have on the results of its operations, financial position or cash flows. In June 2005, the FASB issued Staff Position ("FSP") No. 143 1, "Accounting for Electronic Equipment Waste Obligations," which provides guidance on accounting for historical waste obligations associated with the European Union Waste, Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive ("WEEE Directive"). FSP No. 143 1 is effective for the first reporting period ending after June 8, 2005 or the date of the adoption of the WEEE Directive into law by the applicable European Union member country. Because European Union member countries have not yet, among other steps, (i) fully enacted their national laws relating to WEEE, (ii) completed implementation of their administrative measures and programs, (iii) clarified the scope of products considered WEEE, and or (iv) established pricing for recycling of WEEE, the Company can not at this time reasonably estimate the effect of applying this guidance in future periods. The Company continues to monitor WEEE developments in the respective EU countries in an effort to reflect the impact of this Directive. 60   Forward Looking Information Certain statements in this report are "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. All statements contained herein that are not clearly historical in nature are forward looking, and the words "anticipate," "believe," "expect," "estimate," "project" and similar expressions are generally intended to identify forward looking statements.

Many of these risks, uncertainties and contingencies are beyond our control, and may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from anticipated results, performance or achievements. Factors that might affect such forward looking statements include, among other things: overall economic and business conditions; the demand for Tycos goods and services; competitive factors in the industries in which Tyco competes; changes in tax requirements (including tax rate changes, new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations); results and consequences of Tycos internal investigation and governmental investigations concerning the Companys governance, management, internal controls and operations; the outcome of litigation and governmental proceedings as a result of actions taken by our former senior corporate management; effect of income tax audit settlements; the ratings on our debt and our ability to repay or refinance our outstanding indebtedness as it matures; our ability to operate within the limitations imposed by financing arrangements and to maintain our credit ratings; interest rate fluctuations and other changes in borrowing costs; other capital market conditions, including foreign currency rate fluctuations; availability of and fluctuations in the prices of key raw materials, including steel and resin; economic and political conditions in international markets, including governmental changes and restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders; the ability to achieve cost savings in connection with the Companys strategic restructuring and Six Sigma initiatives; potential further impairment of our goodwill and or our long lived assets; the impact of fluctuations in the price of Tyco common shares; changes in U.S. and non U.S. government regulations in general, and in particular changes in rules and regulations regarding the safety, efficacy, sales, promotions, insurance reimbursement and pricing of Tycos disposable medical products and other specialty products, as well as changes in rules and regulations regarding the retirement and disposal of certain electrical products; the possible effects on Tyco of future legislation in the U.S. that may limit or eliminate potential U.S. tax benefits resulting from Tycos incorporation in Bermuda or deny U.S. government contracts to Tyco based upon its incorporation in Bermuda; and the potential distraction costs associated with negative publicity relating to actions of our former senior corporate management. 61 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are subject to market risk associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. In order to manage the volatility relating to our more significant market risks, we enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts, cross currency swaps, foreign currency options, and interest rate swaps. We do not anticipate any material changes in our primary market risk exposures in 2006. We utilize established risk management policies and procedures in executing derivative financial instrument transactions. We do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Derivative financial instruments related to interest rate sensitivity of debt obligations, intercompany cross border transactions and anticipated non functional currency cash flows, are used with the goal of mitigating a significant portion of these exposures when it is cost effective to do so. Counterparties to derivative financial instruments are limited to financial institutions with at least an A/A2 long term debt rating. Interest Rate Sensitivity The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, including debt obligations and interest rate swaps. For debt obligations, the table presents cash flows of principal repayment and weighted average interest rates. For interest rate and cross currency swaps, the table presents notional amounts at the current market price rate and weighted average interest rates. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract.
