Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations including the effects of the restatement described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements should be read together with the Selected Financial Data and our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements due to many factors, including but not limited to those under the headings "Risk Factors" and "Forward Looking Information." Introduction The Consolidated Financial Statements include the consolidated accounts of Tyco International Ltd., a company organized under the laws of Bermuda, and its subsidiaries (hereinafter collectively referred to as "we," the "Company" or "Tyco") and have been prepared in United States dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Company operates in the following business segments: Electronics designs, manufactures and distributes electrical and electronic components and related solutions; Fire and Security designs, manufactures, installs, monitors and services electronic security and fire protection systems; Healthcare designs, manufactures and distributes medical devices and supplies, imaging agents, pharmaceuticals and adult incontinence and infant care products; and Engineered Products and Services designs, manufactures, distributes and services engineered products, including industrial valves and controls, as well as steel tubular goods, and provides consulting, engineering and construction management and operating services. The operating results of the Tyco Global Network ("TGN") business are presented within Corporate through the date of its disposal in the third quarter of 2005. Restatement Review of Prior Period Stock Option Grant Practices Following publicity in 2006 regarding the granting of stock options at a number of companies, the Company initiated an internal review of its historical stock option grant practices to determine whether the Companys stock option award actions were appropriately governed and were accurately reflected in the Companys financial statements. The Companys Internal Audit staff, which reports directly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, began a review of the Companys equity incentive plan practices and associated approvals over the period October 1999 through June 2006. In addition to its review of plan administration, the Internal Audit staff performed detailed audit procedures on more than 95% of share options granted through the regular and off cycle grants during this period. The audit procedures covered 100% of named executive officers and Section 16 officers and directors. The Companys review included an evaluation of grant authorizations, an assessment of the appropriate measurement dates under Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and the application of appropriate equity pricing methodology. The Company has determined that between October 1999 and 2002, there were several grants for which complete documentation was not available. As such, validation of the appropriate measurement date under APB Opinion No. 25 was difficult to determine with precision. For such grants, the Company determined an appropriate measurement date in reliance upon all available evidence and 38 consideration of alternatives, including the communication date to grantees for all grants, to establish a reasonable date upon which equity recipients and share awards were known, fixed and ready to be communicated to employees. To the extent the Company was able to conclude that grant date lists were fixed and ready to be communicated to employees, the measurement date was considered to be the grant date. However, in many instances, the measurement date the Company used was the date that the equity award was communicated to the recipient. The Company has concluded that errors relating to the Companys stock option accounting primarily resulted from: (a) incomplete documentation to enable application of accounting principles under APB Opinion No. 25; (b) the unintentional misapplication of generally accepted accounting principles; and (c) the absence of adequate control procedures in 1999 through early 2002 designed to ensure equity recipients and share awards were fixed and certain prior to the legal grant date. The amount of aggregate compensation expense related to this item, which the Company should have recorded in prior periods, is $252 million pre tax and $173 million after tax, relating to grants awarded prior to the end of 2002. None of this amount relates to 2006, $17 million pre tax ($8 million after tax) relates to 2005 and $66 million pre tax ($46 million after tax) relates to 2004, as awards vested over the relevant vesting periods. Had the Company used the communication date as the measurement date in all instances, the difference in the amount recorded would not have been material to any period or in the aggregate. Review of Equity Plan Compliance Separately, the Company identified an error related to the recognition of compensation expense under the Companys employee stock purchase program in the United Kingdom. The aggregate compensation expense related to this item which the Company should have recorded in 2002 2005 is $29 million pre tax and $20 million after tax. None of this amount relates to 2006, $7 million pre tax ($5 million after tax) relates to 2005 and $19 million pre tax ($13 million after tax) relates to 2004. Effect of Restatement Taken together, these prior period errors result in an aggregate understatement of compensation expense of $281 million pre tax and $193 million after tax. Based on the findings of the items discussed above, the Company has restated its reported results for prior periods to reflect the impact of additional stock based compensation expense in Corporate. The impact by year is as follows ($ in millions): 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 and Prior Total Pre tax impact $ 24 $ 85 $ 84 $ 75 $ 13 $ 281 After tax impact $ 13 $ 59 $ 59 $ 53 $ 9 $ 193 The impact on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, and the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2005, as a result of the above restatement, is summarized in the tables below. There was no impact on total cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended September 30, 2005 and 2004. The amounts previously reported are derived from the 39 Form 10 K for the year ended September 30, 2005 filed on December 9, 2005 and have been reclassified for the effects of discontinued operations.

Overview As previously reported in our periodic filings, on January 13, 2006, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a plan to separate the Company into three separate, publicly traded companies Tyco Healthcare, one of the worlds leading diversified healthcare companies; Tyco Electronics, the worlds largest passive electronic components manufacturer; and a combination of Tyco Fire and Security and Engineered Products and Services, a global business with leading positions in residential and commercial security, fire protection, and industrial products and services (the "Proposed Separation"). After thorough reviews of strategic options with our Board of Directors, we believe that this strategy is the best way to position our market leading companies for sustained growth and value creation. Following the Proposed Separation, Tycos shareholders will own 100% of the equity in all three companies through tax free stock dividends. Each company will have its own independent Board of 41 Directors and strong corporate governance standards. We expect to file Registration Statements in connection with the Proposed Separation during the second quarter of 2007. In connection with the Proposed Separation, the Company continues to estimate that the net economic cost to complete the transaction is expected to approximate $1.0 billion, largely for tax restructuring, debt refinancing, professional services and employee related costs. Depending on prevailing market conditions through the date of the Proposed Separation, the Company anticipates that the corresponding income statement charges would be larger than net economic cost to complete the Proposed Separation. The difference between the income statement charges and the estimated net economic cost is expected to result from costs to retire, refinance or reassign debt, as well as non cash charges. During 2006, the Company incurred $169 million of costs related to the Proposed Separation primarily related to legal, accounting and consulting work associated with executing the transaction. Consummation of the Proposed Separation is subject to certain conditions, including final approval by the Tyco Board of Directors, receipt of certain tax rulings, necessary opinions of counsel, the filing and effectiveness of registration statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the completion of any necessary debt refinancings. Approval by the Companys shareholders is not required as a condition to the consummation of the Proposed Separation. Tyco has received an initial private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Proposed Separation noting it will qualify for favorable tax treatment. We are focused on growing profitability within each of these companies before and after the Proposed Separation, so that each may be well positioned for long term growth as independent entities. Following the Proposed Separation, we expect that all three companies will be dividend paying companies. As we prepare for the Proposed Separation, we remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. During 2006, we repurchased 95 million of our common shares for $2.5 billion under our share repurchase programs. We completed the $1.5 billion share repurchase program previously approved by the Board of Directors with the repurchase of 45 million of our common shares for $1.2 billion and we repurchased an additional 50 million of our common shares for $1.3 billion under the new $2.0 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in May 2006. We have $659 million remaining on the $2.0 billion share repurchase program which we expect to complete prior to the Proposed Separation. During 2006, holders of Tyco International Group S.A., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company organized under the laws of Luxembourg ("TIGSA") Series A 2.75% convertible senior debentures due 2018 with a 2008 put option converted $1.2 billion of these debentures into 54 million Tyco common shares and redeemed the remaining $1 million principal amount outstanding with cash. Additionally, we utilized $1.0 billion in cash for a scheduled repayment of public notes and terminated one of our synthetic lease facilities for a total cash payment of $203 million, reducing principal debt and minority interest by $191 million and $10 million, respectively. In October 2006, we exercised our right to buy five cable laying sea vessels that were previously included under an off balance sheet leasing arrangement for $280 million. During 2006, we completed the sale of our Plastics and Adhesives segment. Our Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses were sold for net proceeds of $882 million and the A&E Products Group was sold for net proceeds of $2 million. During 2006, the Company also recorded a $30 million receivable due from the purchaser of the Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses based on the decline of average resin prices during fiscal year 2006, as contemplated in the definitive sale agreement. This amount is payable to Tyco no later than January 2007. Additionally, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell Printed Circuit Group ("PCG"), a Tyco Electronics business and leading manufacturer of high technology printed circuit boards for the military, aerospace and commercial markets, for $226 million. This transaction was completed on October 27, 2006 and a gain on sale of approximately $45 million is expected. As such, the operations of our Plastics and Adhesives 42 segment and PCG business are reflected as discontinued operations in all periods presented. Details related to the Companys divestiture program and the related discontinued operations are discussed in "Discontinued Operations and Divestitures." We are continuing to assess the strategic fit of our various businesses and are considering additional divestitures where businesses do not align with our long term vision. To further improve operating efficiency, during the first quarter of 2007, we have launched a restructuring program across all segments including the corporate organization which will streamline some of the businesses and reduce our operational footprint. We expect to incur charges of approximately $600 million over the next two years, of which $500 million is expected to be incurred in 2007. We expect that the total cash expenditures for this program will be approximately $450 million, of which $250 million is expected in 2007. We believe this restructuring program will strengthen our competitive position over the long term. Operating Results Net revenue and net income for the years ended September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005 and 2004, as restated, was as follows ($ in millions): 2006 2005 (Restated) 2004 (Restated) Revenue from product sales $ 33,146 $ 31,533 $ 29,886 Service revenue 7,814 7,772 8,074 Net revenue $ 40,960 $ 39,305 $ 37,960 Operating income $ 5,474 $ 5,768 $ 5,146 Interest income 134 123 91 Interest expense (713 ) (815 ) (956 ) Other expense, net (11 ) (911 ) (286 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest 4,884 4,165 3,995 Income taxes (799 ) (1,112 ) (1,112 ) Minority interest (10 ) (9 ) (14 ) Income from continuing operations 4,075 3,044 2,869 Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes (348 ) (46 ) (49 ) Income before cumulative effect of accounting change 3,727 2,998 2,820 Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of income taxes (14 ) 21 Net income $ 3,713 $ 3,019 $ 2,820 Net revenue increased $1.7 billion, or 4.2%, for 2006 as compared to 2005, as a result of growth in all segments, led by Electronics and Engineered Products and Services. Foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures negatively impacted 2006 revenue growth by $326 million and $125 million, respectively. Operating income decreased $294 million, or 5.1%, for 2006 while operating margin decreased 1.3 percentage points to 13.4%. Operating income for 2006 was unfavorably impacted by charges of $426 million, consisting of separation costs of $169 million; incremental stock option charges of $161 million as required under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123R, "Share Based Payment," charges of $63 million related to purchased in process research and development and net restructuring and impairment charges of $33 million, of which $6 million is included in cost of sales. Operating income for 2006 also included net gains and impairments on divestitures of $44 million, $72 million of income related to a settlement with a former executive and 43 $48 million of income resulting from a reduction in our estimated workers compensation liabilities primarily due to favorable claims experience. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected operating income by $52 million. Net revenue increased $1.3 billion, or 3.5%, for 2005 as compared to 2004, which resulted from growth in all segments. Foreign currency exchange rates favorably affected 2005 by $873 million while the impact of divestitures and acquisitions negatively impacted the period by $689 million. Operating income increased $622 million, or 12.1%, for 2005 while operating margin increased 1.1 percentage point to 14.7%. Operating income for 2005 was favorably impacted by the gain on the sale of the TGN business of $301 million. In addition, the year was unfavorably impacted by charges related to an adverse decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on a patent dispute in the Healthcare segment of $277 million, a charge related to an SEC enforcement action of $50 million and a charge relating to former executives employment of $70 million. Foreign currency exchange rates favorably affected operating income by $142 million. Results by Geographic Area Net revenue by geographic area for the years ended September 29, 2006, September 30, 2005 and 2004 was as follows ($ in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Net revenue: United States $ 19,985 $ 19,298 $ 19,254 Other Americas 2,494 2,202 2,103 Europe 11,498 11,407 10,830 Asia Pacific 6,983 6,398 5,773 Net revenue(1) $ 40,960 $ 39,305 $ 37,960 (1)Revenue from external customers is attributed to individual countries based on the reporting entity that records the transaction. Segment Results The segment discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in results for each segment included in continuing operations. Electronics Net revenue, operating income and operating margin for Electronics for the years ended September 29, 2006, September 30, 2005 and 2004 were as follows ($ in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Revenue from product sales $ 12,515 $ 11,620 $ 10,921 Service revenue 209 154 450 Net revenue $ 12,724 $ 11,774 $ 11,371 Operating income $ 1,808 $ 1,849 $ 1,744 Operating margin 14.2 % 15.7 % 15.3 % Net revenue for Electronics increased $950 million or 8.1% in 2006 as compared to 2005, including a 7.7% increase in product revenue. The increase in net revenue reflects broad based volume growth across most customer end markets, especially premise wiring, industrial machinery and equipment, consumer electronics, communications equipment manufacturing and communication service provider markets. These increases were partially offset by the impact of unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $148 million. 44  Operating income and operating margin for 2006 decreased as compared to 2005 due primarily to increased material costs of $306 million, incremental stock option charges of $40 million required under SFAS No. 123R and negative changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $23 million. Additionally, operating income for 2006 included net restructuring, divestiture and impairment charges of $16 million, of which $6 million is reflected in cost of sales, as compared to net restructuring and other credits of $10 million in 2005, discussed below. Operating income for 2006 also includes $3 million related to the Proposed Separation. Net revenue for Electronics increased $403 million or 3.5% in 2005 as compared to 2004, including a 6.4% increase in product revenue. The increase in net revenue was driven primarily by sales to the automotive, aerospace and defense, consumer electronics, power utilities, communications equipment manufacturing and communication service provider markets. In addition, revenue increased substantially due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $291 million. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the divestiture of the Electrical Contracting Services business of $353 million. Operating income and operating margin for 2005 increased as compared to 2004 due primarily to increased sales volume, cost savings initiatives and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $57 million. These increases were partially offset by an 80 basis point impact of increased commodity costs. Additionally, operating income for 2005 included net restructuring and other credits of $10 million, as compared to net restructuring, divestiture and impairment charges of $20 million in 2004. Fire and Security Net revenue, operating income and operating margin for Fire and Security for the years ended September 29, 2006, September 30, 2005 and 2004 were as follows ($ in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Revenue from product sales $ 5,426 $ 5,299 $ 5,343 Service revenue 6,227 6,204 6,104 Net revenue $ 11,653 $ 11,503 $ 11,447 Operating income $ 1,190 $ 1,216 $ 899 Operating margin 10.2 % 10.6 % 7.9 % Net revenue for Fire and Security increased $150 million or 1.3% in 2006 as compared to 2005, including a 2.4% increase in product revenue. Revenue from product sales includes sales and installation of security, fire protection and other systems. Net revenue increased due to growth in Worldwide Fire Protection Contracting and Services primarily related to electrical and mechanical contracting as well as growth in the North American and international markets in our Worldwide Electronic Security Services. These increases were offset by the impact of acquisitions and divestitures of $117 million, unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $60 million, and a decrease in sales of breathing and fire detection products within Safety Products. Operating income decreased $26 million in 2006 over the prior year primarily as a result of lower margins, increased investments in selling and marketing and a decline in European recurring monitoring revenues within Worldwide Electronic Security Services. Results for the current period included net restructuring, impairment and divestiture charges of $11 million as compared to net restructuring, impairment and divestiture charges of $28 million in 2005. Operating income for 2006 was favorably impacted by cost savings related to operational excellence initiatives and prior year restructuring programs. In addition, 2006 operating income was unfavorably impacted by $2 million 45 related to the Proposed Separation as well as incremental stock option charges of $35 million required under SFAS No. 123R. Attrition rates for customers in our Worldwide Electronic Security Services business decreased to 13.8% on a trailing twelve month basis for 2006, as compared to 14.8% for 2005 and 15.1% in 2004. Net revenue for Fire and Security remained relatively level during 2005 as compared to 2004 as the decrease in product revenue was offset by an increase in service revenue. Revenue from product sales includes sales and installation of security, fire protection and other systems. Net revenue increased due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $274 million and, to a lesser extent, increased sales volume of breathing and intrusion products at Tyco Safety Products as well as growth in our European fire services business. These increases were offset by the impact of divestitures of $315 million and decreased sales at our security business in Europe. Operating income increased $317 million in 2005 over the prior year. Results for the current period included net restructuring, impairment and divestiture charges of $28 million as compared to net restructuring, impairment and divestiture charges of $264 million in 2004. Operating income for 2005 was also favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rates of $26 million as well as cost savings related to operational excellence initiatives and prior year restructuring programs. These cost reductions were partially offset by increased investment in sales and marketing. Healthcare Net revenue, operating income and operating margin for Healthcare for the years ended September 29, 2006, September 30, 2005 and 2004 were as follows ($ in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Revenue from product sales $ 9,579 $ 9,477 $ 9,040 Service revenue 62 66 70 Net revenue $ 9,641 $ 9,543 $ 9,110 Operating income $ 2,200 $ 2,286 $ 2,365 Operating margin 22.8 % 24.0 % 26.0 % Net revenue for Healthcare increased $98 million or 1.0% in 2006 as compared to 2005. This increase was largely driven by the International and Surgical divisions within Medical Devices & Supplies as a result of strong growth across the majority of geographic regions in surgical sales including laparoscopy, ablation and vessel sealing, and to a lesser extent, sutures. Also contributing to the revenue increase was volume growth in Bulk Pharmaceuticals (active pharmaceutical ingredients) and Retail, with growth primarily driven by new product sales and distribution, growth in Latin America, as well as favorable economic trends and strategic promotional efforts in key markets. These increases were partially offset by the adverse impact of voluntary product recalls in Imaging and lower volume sales within Respiratory, in addition to the negative changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $93 million. Operating income and operating margin decreased $86 million and 1.2 percentage points, respectively, as compared to 2005. The increased volume in Medical Devices & Supplies, discussed above, was more than offset by unfavorable manufacturing performance primarily in Respiratory and Imaging, as a result of lower volumes and higher expenses primarily associated with voluntary product recalls, as well as weakness in Retail of $40 million. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income, although to a lesser extent, was additional investments in research and development and selling expenses. Operating income was adversely impacted by a charge of $63 million related to purchased in process research and development, incremental stock option charges required under SFAS No. 123R of $37 million, $2 million of charges related to the Proposed Separation and a $31 million negative 46 impact related to foreign currency exchange rates. Additionally, operating income for 2006 included a gain on divestiture of $48 million, primarily relating to a sale of a business within Medical Devices and Supplies. Net revenue for Healthcare increased $433 million or 4.8% in 2005 as compared to 2004. This increase resulted primarily from growth in existing businesses and, to a lesser extent, favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $141 million. Growth in Healthcares underlying businesses was principally driven by increased revenue within Medical Devices & Supplies which was largely the result of increased sales volume in the International division, primarily in Europe, due to a sales force investment and sales growth in vessel sealing, laparoscopy, and stapling. Increased sales at the Surgical division within Medical Devices & Supplies also strongly contributed, due to enhanced contracting with group purchasing organizations, increased acceptance of Laparoscopic Gastric By Pass procedures and increased adoption of LigaSure device. Pharmaceuticals also contributed to the increase in revenue, although to a lesser extent. These increases were partially offset by decreased sales in Retail primarily due to a difficult competitive environment and customer consolidations. The decreases in operating income and operating margin in 2005 as compared to 2004 were due primarily to a $277 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005, associated with the adverse decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on a previously disclosed legal matter. (Refer to Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.) This charge, combined with declines in the Retail division as a result of the competitive environment mentioned above as well as increased material and transportation costs, was offset by substantial increases from other divisions, specifically the International and Surgical divisions within Medical Devices & Supplies as well as within Pharmaceutical. Increases in these divisions were due to strong sales growth as mentioned above, combined with a favorable product mix. Also positively impacting the segment were reduced administrative expenses at the segment level, as well as favorable foreign exchange rates of $41 million. Engineered Products and Services Net revenue, operating income and operating margin for Engineered Products and Services for the years ended September 29, 2006, September 30, 2005 and 2004 were as follows ($ in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Revenue from product sales $ 5,625 $ 5,137 $ 4,582 Service revenue 1,317 1,319 1,425 Net revenue $ 6,942 $ 6,456 $ 6,007 Operating income $ 676 $ 672 $ 620 Operating margin 9.7 % 10.4 % 10.3 % Net revenue for Engineered Products and Services increased $486 million or 7.5% in 2006 as compared to 2005. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by Flow Control as a result of strong project volume in the Pacific Region and favorable market conditions in Asia and North America, as well as increased selling prices in Electrical & Metal Products due to higher costs of copper. To a lesser extent, Tyco Fire & Building Products experienced growth in the industrial and commercial construction markets and increased price realization. The above increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease at Infrastructure Services as a result of a strategic decision to be more selective in bidding for new projects, which has resulted in fewer but more profitable projects, and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $25 million. Operating income remained relatively level in 2006 as compared to 2005. Both the revenue growth at Flow Control and Fire & Building Products, as well as favorable copper spreads in Electrical & 47 Metal Products and higher margin projects at Infrastructure Services contributed positively to operating income in 2006. Offsetting this growth was a $100 million charge relating to the Voluntary Replacement Program for certain sprinkler heads (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and incremental stock option charges of $17 million required under SFAS No. 123R. Net revenue for Engineered Products and Services increased $449 million or 7.5% in 2005 as compared to 2004. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by increased selling prices in Electrical & Metal Products due to higher costs of steel and other raw materials. In addition, Flow Control and, to a lesser extent, Tyco Fire & Building Products experienced growth in the industrial and commercial construction markets. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $167 million also contributed to the increase in revenue. The above increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease at Infrastructure Services as a result of a strategic decision to be more selective in bidding for new projects, which has resulted in fewer but more profitable projects. The increases in operating income and operating margin in 2005 as compared to 2004 were due primarily to increased volume and demand within the industrial and commercial markets, along with the impact of operational excellence initiatives, cost reductions from prior period restructuring programs and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $21 million. These increases more than offset the impact of higher raw material costs. Additionally, 2005 operating income includes $4 million of net restructuring, impairment and divestiture charges as compared to the $62 million of net restructuring, impairment and divestiture charges in 2004. Corporate Corporate net revenue was $29 million and $25 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, which related to the TGN business which was sold in the third quarter of 2005. Corporate expense was $400 million, $255 million and $482 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Corporate expense for 2006 includes $162 million related to the Proposed Separation and incremental stock option charges of $32 million required under SFAS No. 123R. Corporate expense also includes income related to a settlement with a former executive of $72 million as well as $48 million of income resulting from a reduction in our estimated workers compensation liabilities primarily due to favorable claims experience. Operating income for 2005 and 2004 has been restated to reflect additional compensation expense of $24 million and $85 million, respectively, related to the review of prior period stock option grant practices and equity plan compliance. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Corporate expense for 2005 includes a $301 million gain on the sale of the TGN business and TGN operating losses of $54 million. In addition, corporate expenses for 2005 included a $50 million charge representing the fines and penalties that the Company paid to resolve the matters raised in the SEC investigation that commenced in June 2002, as well as a $70 million charge for estimated legacy contingencies related to former executives employment. Corporate expense for 2004 includes net charges of $14 million, which consists of charges for the impairment of long lived assets of $8 million and net restructuring charges of $6 million primarily attributable to severance related to the relocation of the corporate headquarters. Expense also included $73 million of operating losses related to the TGN. Interest Income and Expense Interest income was $134 million in 2006, as compared to $123 million and $91 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Interest expense was $713 million in 2006, as compared to $815 million in 2005 and $956 million in 2004. The decrease in interest expense in 2006 is primarily driven by lower debt balances, partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates on our interest rate swap program as compared to 2005. 48 The decrease in interest expense in 2005 over 2004 is primarily the result of lower debt balances, partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates on our interest rate swap program compared to 2004. The weighted average rates of interest on total debt outstanding during 2006, 2005 and 2004 were 5.9%, 5.6% and 5.2%, respectively. Other Expense, Net During 2006, other expense, net consisted primarily of a loss relating to the write down of certain investments to their net realizable value. During 2005, other expense, net included a loss on the retirement of debt. The Company repurchased $1,241 million principal amount of its outstanding 2.75% convertible senior debentures for $1,823 million and $750 million principal amount of its outstanding 3.125% convertible senior debentures for $1,147 million. These repurchases resulted in a $1,013 million loss on the retirement of debt, including the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs. Also during 2005, other expense, net included income of $109 million related to a court ordered restitution award. On September 12, 2002, indictments were filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York against Mr. L. Dennis Kozlowski, our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Mark H. Swartz, our former Chief Financial Officer and director (together, the "Defendants"), alleging enterprise corruption, fraud, conspiracy, grand larceny, falsifying certain business records and other crimes. On June 17, 2005, a jury convicted the Defendants on 22 of 23 counts in the indictment. On September 19, 2005, the Defendants were sentenced in New York State Supreme Court to serve eight and one third years to twenty five years in prison and to make joint restitution to the Company in the amount of $134 million, resulting from the larceny convictions. The restitution award is comprised of $109 million of previously expensed compensation made to the defendants and reported as other expense, net in prior years and $25 million related to a loan receivable from one of the Defendants which had been and remains reflected in the Companys consolidated financial statements as a receivable. The Defendants have filed a notice of appeal of the convictions. The Company considered the collectibility of the restitution award and assessed the likelihood of the Defendants success upon appeal of the larceny convictions, which, if successful, could result in a change to the restitution order, and has concluded that receipt of the restitution award is probable. The Court ordered the restitution payment to be made by no later than one year from the date of sentencing. Tyco has initiated the process of collecting the restitution payment owed, subject to the pending appeal. During October 2006, the Company received payment of $38 million relating to the restitution and expects to receive the remaining amount in the second quarter of 2007. During 2004, other expense, net consisted primarily of a loss on the retirement of debt. The Company repurchased $303 million of its 7.2% notes due 2008 for cash of $341 million, which resulted in a $38 million loss, including the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs. Additionally, the Company repurchased $517 million of its outstanding 2.75% convertible senior debentures with a 2008 put option. The total purchase price paid was $750 million and the repurchase resulted in a $241 million loss on the retirement of debt, including the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 16.4%, 26.7% and 27.8% for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 2005 to 2006 was primarily the result of additional releases of deferred tax asset valuation allowances, as a result of improved historical and projected profitability in certain jurisdictions, and a $127 million favorable adjustment to correct prior year tax reserves on legacy tax matters. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 2004 to 2005 is primarily the result of the release of valuation allowances, benefits realized related to the TGN divestiture, as well as the court ordered restitution award related to certain former executives for which there is no tax obligation 49 and, to a lesser extent, increased profitability in operations in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. This decrease is partially offset by an increase in charges for which no tax benefit was available such as the loss on retirement of debt, asset impairments and the estimated settlement of the SEC enforcement action. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $1,731 million and $1,871 million at September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," which requires a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is "more likely than not" that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by these taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as payment is not expected within one year. The Company and its subsidiaries income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. In connection with such examinations, tax authorities, including the United States Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. The Company is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies that management has assessed as probable and estimable have been recorded. While the timing and ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain, the Company anticipates that certain of these matters could be resolved during 2007. The IRS continues to audit the years 1997 to 2000. In 2004 the Company submitted to the IRS proposed adjustments to these prior period U.S. federal income tax returns, resulting in a reduction in the taxable income previously filed. During 2006, the IRS accepted substantially all of the proposed adjustments. These adjustments did not have a material impact on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company. During 2006, the Company has developed amendments to U.S. federal income tax returns for additional periods. On the basis of previously accepted amendments, the Company has determined that acceptance of these adjustments is probable and accordingly has recorded them in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such adjustments did not have a material impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Except for earnings that are currently distributed, no additional provision has been made for U.S. or non U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or the Company has concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of distribution of such earnings. A liability could arise if amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries. 50 Discontinued Operations and Divestitures Discontinued Operations During 2006, the Company consummated the sale of the Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses as well as the A&E Product business for $975 million and $6 million in gross cash proceeds, respectively. Working capital and other adjustments resulted in net proceeds of $882 million for the sale of the Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses. During 2006, the Company also recorded a $30 million receivable due from the purchaser of the Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses based on the decline of average resin prices during fiscal year 2006, as contemplated in the definitive sale agreement. This amount is payable to Tyco no later than January 2007. Net cash proceeds received for the sale of the A&E Products business was $2 million, which does not include working capital provisions which are expected to be settled prior to the end of calendar year 2006. Both businesses met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and have been included in discontinued operations in all periods presented. During 2006, the Company recorded a $261 million and $26 million pre tax loss on sale from discontinued operations related to the Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses and A&E Products business, respectively, which include $275 million and $22 million, respectively, of pre tax impairment charges to write the businesses down to their fair values less costs to sell. Fair values used for the respective impairment assessments were based on existing market conditions and the terms and conditions included or expected to be included in the respective sale agreements. During 2006, the Company approved a plan to divest the Printed Circuit Group ("PCG") business, a component of the Electronics segment, and also entered into a definitive sale agreement to sell PCG for $226 million in cash. During 2006, the Company recorded a $4 million pre tax loss on sale from discontinued operations for PCG related to the divestiture of the PCG Spain business as well as certain other costs to sell. The sale of PCG was completed in October 2006 and the Company expects to record a gain on the sale of approximately $45 million. See Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The PCG business met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and has been included in discontinued operations in all periods presented. In 2005, Tyco announced its intent to explore the divesture of its Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses, as well as the A&E Products business, a global manufacturer of plastic film, specialty tapes and adhesives, coated products and garment hangers. As a result of consideration for potential sale and deteriorating operating results in the A&E Products business, the Company performed an interim assessment of the recoverability of both goodwill and long lived assets and determined that the book value of certain long lived assets in the A&E Products business was greater than their estimated fair value and consequently recorded a long lived asset impairment of $40 million and goodwill impairment charge of $162 million. Fair value used for the impairment assessment was based on probability weighted expected future cash flow of the assets. During 2005, the Company divested 8 businesses which were reported as discontinued operations within Fire and Security, Engineered Products and Services and the Plastics and Adhesives business segment. The Company reported losses on sale or additional impairments to write the carrying value of such assets down to their estimated fair value less costs to sell of $60 million during 2005. During 2004, the Company reported losses on the sale of discontinued operations of $132 million to write the carrying value of such assets down to their fair value less cost to sell. For the additional 8 businesses in 2005 and the divested businesses in 2004, fair value used for the impairment assessment was primarily based on the terms and conditions included or expected to be included in the sales agreements. 51 (Gains) losses on divestitures During 2004, the Company divested twenty one and liquidated four non core businesses across all business segments primarily within Fire and Security. During 2004, the Company recorded net losses and impairments on divestitures of $116 million in continuing operations in connection with the divestiture or write down to fair value of certain held for sale businesses. During 2005, Tyco agreed to sell the TGN, its undersea fiber optic telecommunication network. The sale was consummated on June 30, 2005. As part of the sale transaction, Tyco received gross cash proceeds of $130 million, and the purchaser assumed certain liabilities. In connection with this sale, Tyco recorded a $301 million gain which is reflected in (gains) losses on divestitures in the Consolidated Statement of Income for 2005. The Company has presented the operations of the TGN in continuing operations as the criteria for discontinued operations were not met. During 2005, the Company divested 10 businesses that were reported as continuing operations in Fire and Security, Healthcare and Engineered Products and Services. The Company recorded net losses and impairments on divestitures of $32 million, including a $3 million charge reflected in cost of sales, in connection with the divestiture and liquidation of these businesses, as well as the write down to estimated fair value of certain held for sale businesses. During 2006, the Company divested 6 businesses that were reported as continuing operations in Fire and Security and Healthcare. The Company recorded net gains on divestitures of $46 million in connection with the divestiture of these businesses, less $2 million of divestiture charges related to the write down to estimated fair value and costs to sell certain other held for sale businesses. For the divested businesses during 2006, 2005 and 2004, fair value used for the impairment assessment was primarily based on the terms and conditions included or expected to be included in the sales agreements. Acquisitions During 2006, Tycos Healthcare segment acquired over 90% ownership in Floreane Medical Implants, S.A. ("Floreane") for approximately $123 million in cash, net of cash acquired of $3 million. Floreane is an innovator in the development of surgical support implants for parietal, urological and gynecological surgery. The remaining outstanding shares would be acquired if they become available. The Company recorded a $3 million in process research and development charge in conjunction with the acquisition. During 2006, Tycos Healthcare segment also acquired over 50% ownership of Airox S.A. ("Airox") for approximately $59 million, net of cash acquired of $4 million. Airox is a leading European company in the home respiratory ventilation systems business. Tyco expects to acquire the remaining Airox shares in a mandatory tender offer. The initial share purchase and the subsequent tender offer combined are expected to total approximately $108 million. The Company has also recorded an $11 million in process research and development charge in conjunction with the acquisition. The charge relates to the development of second generation technology which has not yet obtained regulatory approval. As of the acquisition date, the in process research and development was not considered to be technologically feasible or to have any alternative future use. During 2006, Tycos Healthcare segment also acquired Confluent Surgical, Inc. ("Confluent"). The total purchase price is expected to be $246 million. As of September 29, 2006, the Company has paid approximately $200 million in cash, net of cash acquired of $12 million. The Company has also deposited approximately $34 million of the total purchase price into an escrow account related to closing balance sheet adjustments and certain indemnifications to be resolved through fiscal 2008. The Company recorded a $49 million in process research and development charge in conjunction with the acquisition related to technology which Confluent is developing for numerous applications across 52 several surgical disciplines which have not yet received regulatory approval. As of the acquisition date, the in process research and development was not considered to be technologically feasible or to have any alternative future use. Cash paid for other acquisitions in 2006 totaled $31 million, net of $8 million cash acquired. In July 2005, Tycos Healthcare segment acquired Vivant Medical Inc. ("Vivant"), a developer of microwave ablation medical technology. The transaction is valued at approximately $66 million cash, with up to approximately $35 million additional cash to be paid in the future based on achieving certain milestones. Cash paid, net of cash acquired, for various other acquisitions totaled $16 million. During 2004, the Company completed the acquisition of two businesses within Engineered Products and Services and Fire and Security for an aggregate cost of $9 million. These acquisitions were funded utilizing cash from operations. The results of operations of the acquired companies have been included in Tycos consolidated results from the respective acquisition dates. These acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change During 2006, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation ("FIN") No. 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143." Accordingly, the Company has recognized asset retirement obligations of $32 million and property, plant and equipment, net of $10 million in its Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 29, 2006. In addition, the Company recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change which resulted in a $14 million after tax loss ($22 million pre tax). Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on FIN No. 47. During 2005, the Company changed the measurement date for its pension and postretirement benefit plans, from September 30th to August 31st, effective October 1, 2004. The Company believes that the one month change of measurement date is a preferable change as it allows management adequate time to evaluate and report the actuarial information in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements under the accelerated reporting deadlines. As a result of this change, the Company recorded a $21 million after tax gain ($28 million pre tax) cumulative effect of accounting change. Refer to Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on retirement plans. Change in Fiscal Year and Reporting Calendar Alignment Effective October 1, 2004, Tyco changed its fiscal year end from a calendar fiscal year ending September 30 to a "52 53 week" year ending on the last Friday of September, such that each quarterly period will be 13 weeks in length. In addition, certain of the Companys subsidiaries had consistently closed their books up to one month prior to the Companys fiscal period end. These subsidiaries now report results for the same period as the reported results of the consolidated Company. The impact of this change was not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Net income for the transition period related to this change was $26 million and was reported within Shareholders Equity during 2005. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 53 assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. Depreciation and Amortization Method for Security Monitoring Systems Tyco generally considers its electronic security assets in three asset pools: internally generated residential systems, internally generated commercial systems and customer accounts acquired through the ADT dealer program. The determination of the depreciable lives of subscriber systems, as defined below, included in property, plant and equipment, and the amortizable lives of customer contracts and related customer relationships included in intangible assets, are primarily based on historical attrition rates, third party lifing studies and the useful life of the underlying tangible asset. The realizable value and remaining useful lives of these assets could be impacted by changes in customer attrition rates. If the attrition rates were to rise, Tyco may be required to accelerate the depreciation and amortization. With respect to Tycos depreciation policy for security monitoring systems installed in residential and commercial customer premises, the costs of these systems are combined in separate pools for internally generated residential and internally generated commercial account customers (collectively "subscriber systems"), and generally depreciated over ten to fourteen years. Tyco concluded that for residential and commercial account pools the straight line method of depreciation over a ten to fourteen year period continues to be appropriate given the observed actual attrition data for these pools. Tyco purchases residential security monitoring contracts from an external network of independent dealers who operate under the ADT dealer program. The purchase price of these customer contracts is recorded as an intangible asset (i.e., contracts and related customer relationships). Intangible assets arising from the ADT dealer program are amortized in pools determined by the month of contract acquisition on an accelerated basis over the period and pattern of economic benefit that is expected to be obtained from the customer relationship. Tyco believes that the accelerated method that presently best achieves the matching objective described above is the double declining balance method based on a ten year life for the first eight years of the estimated life of the customer relationships converting to the straight line method of amortization for the remaining four years of the estimated relationship period. Actual attrition data is regularly reviewed in order to assess the continued applicability of the accelerated method of amortization described above. Attrition rates for customers in our Worldwide Electronic Security Services business were 13.8%, 14.8% and 15.1% on a trailing 12 month basis for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Revenue Recognition Contract sales for the installation of fire protection systems, large security intruder systems, undersea fiber optic cable systems and other construction related projects are recorded primarily on the percentage of completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon contracted revenue and related estimated cost to completion. The risk of this methodology is its dependence upon estimates of costs to completion, which are subject to the uncertainties inherent in long term contracts. Revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they first become determinable. If estimates are inaccurate, there is risk that our revenue and profits for the period may be overstated or understated. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other markets participants. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience and trend analysis. Loss Contingencies Accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings, self insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on 54 judgment, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates. Additionally, the Company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. Income Taxes In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and international pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction. Any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. If a change in a valuation allowance occurs, which was established in connection with an acquisition, such adjustment may impact goodwill rather than the income tax provision. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If the tax liabilities relate to tax uncertainties existing at the date of the acquisition of a business, the adjustment of such tax liabilities will result in an adjustment to the goodwill recorded at the date of acquisition. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually and more frequently if a triggering event occurs. In performing this assessment, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. Since judgment is involved in performing goodwill valuation analyses, there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated or understated. 55 We elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for all reporting units. When testing for goodwill impairment, the Company follows the guidance prescribed in SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." First, the Company performs a step I goodwill impairment test to identify a potential impairment. In doing so, the Company compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and a step II goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. In the step II goodwill impairment test, the Company compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. The Company allocates the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. Disruptions to our business such as end market conditions and protracted economic weakness, unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units, the divestiture of a significant component of a reporting unit and market capitalization declines may result in our having to perform a goodwill impairment first step valuation analysis for some or all of our reporting units prior to the required annual assessment. These types of events and the resulting analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future. There were no goodwill impairments related to continuing operations during 2006, 2005 and 2004. Goodwill impairments included in loss from discontinued operations in 2005 totaled $162 million. Long Lived Assets Assets held and used by the Company, including property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of evaluating the recoverability of long lived assets to be held and used, a recoverability test is performed based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk. Impairments to long lived assets to be disposed of are recorded based upon the fair value of the applicable assets. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of long lived assets, there is a risk that the carrying value of our long lived assets may be overstated or understated. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations. Two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions. The discount rate represents the market rate for high quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our present value of pension obligations by approximately $225 million. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected long term rates of return on those types of plan assets, in determining the expected long term return on plan assets. A 50 basis point decrease in the expected long term return on plan assets would increase our pension expense by approximately $20 million. 56 Liquidity and Capital Resources The sources of our cash flow from operating activities and the use of a portion of that cash in our operations for the years ended September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005 and 2004, as restated, were as follows ($ in millions): 2006 2005 (Restated) 2004 (Restated) Cash flows from operating activities: Operating income $ 5,474 $ 5,768 $ 5,146 Non cash restructuring and asset impairment charges (credits), net 9 (13 ) 16 (Gains) losses on divestitures (44 ) (271 ) 111 In process research and development 63 Depreciation and amortization(1) 2,065 2,084 2,098 Non cash compensation expense 275 99 121 Deferred income taxes 72 (28 ) 167 Provision for losses on accounts receivable and inventory 174 232 317 Other, net(2) (47 ) 148 79 Net increase in working capital (1,069 ) (61 ) (873 ) Interest income 134 123 91 Interest expense (713 ) (815 ) (956 ) Income tax expense (799 ) (1,112 ) (1,112 ) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 5,594 $ 6,154 $ 5,205 Other cash flow items: Capital expenditures, net(3) $ (1,514 ) $ (1,263 ) $ (987 ) Decrease in sale of accounts receivable 9 18 929 Acquisition of customer accounts (ADT dealer program) (373 ) (328 ) (254 ) Purchase accounting and holdback liabilities (19 ) (47 ) (104 ) Voluntary pension contributions 2 115 567 (1)Includes depreciation expense of $1,415 million, $1,431 million and $1,407 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively and amortization of intangible assets of $650 million, $653 million and $691 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. (2)Includes the add back of losses on the retirement of debt of $2 million, $1,013 million and $284 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. (3)Includes net proceeds of $55 million, $91 million and $140 million received for the sale/disposition of property, plant and equipment in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The net change in total working capital was a cash decrease of $1,069 million in 2006. The components of this change are set forth in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The change in working capital included an increase of $680 million in inventories and a $332 million decrease in accrued and other liabilities, primarily related to decreased accrued legal and audit fees, partially offset by an increase in annual employee bonus compensation. The provision for losses on accounts receivable and inventory decreased from $232 million during the year ended September 30, 2005 to $174 million for the current period. This decrease was driven by improvements across all segments, particularly due to improved accounts receivable aging, an overall improved credit profile of the customer base, and better collections. Consequently, our allowance for doubtful accounts decreased from $421 million at September 30, 2005 to $336 million at September 29, 2006. 57 Cash flows from operating activities and other cash flow items by segment for the year ended September 29, 2006 were as follows ($ in millions): Electronics Fire and Security Healthcare Engineered Products and Services Corporate and Other Total Cash flows from operating activities: Operating income (loss) $ 1,808 $ 1,190 $ 2,200 $ 676 $ (400 ) $ 5,474 Non cash restructuring and asset impairment charges, net 3 1 4 1 9 Losses (gains) on divestitures 2 1 (48 ) 1 (44 ) In process research and development 63 63 Depreciation 463 567 270 104 11 1,415 Intangible assets amortization 70 514 64 2 650 Depreciation and amortization 533 1,081 334 106 11 2,065 Non cash compensation expense 65 56 58 26 70 275 Deferred income taxes 72 72 Provision for losses on accounts receivable and inventory 67 31 48 28 174 Net (increase) decrease in working capital and other (92 ) (126 ) (605 ) 25 (318 ) (1,116 ) Interest income 134 134 Interest expense (713 ) (713 ) Income tax expense (799 ) (799 ) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 2,386 $ 2,234 $ 2,054 $ 862 $ (1,942 ) $ 5,594 Other cash flow items: Capital expenditures, net $ (549 ) $ (433 ) $ (429 ) $ (98 ) $ (5 ) $ (1,514 ) Decrease in sale of accounts receivable 9 9 Acquisition of customer accounts (ADT dealer program) (373 ) (373 ) Purchase accounting and holdback liabilities (4 ) (6 ) (8 ) (1 ) (19 ) Voluntary pension contributions 2 2 During 2006, the Company completed the sale of our Plastics and Adhesives segment, previously announced in 2005. Our Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses were sold for net proceeds of $882 million and the A&E Products Group was sold for $2 million in net cash proceeds. During 2006, we made additional cash outflows of approximately $450 million for the resolution of certain previously accrued legal matters, including a patent dispute in the Healthcare segment, and a cash payment of $50 million to settle the previously disclosed SEC enforcement action. We will continue to use excess cash to repurchase shares. During 2006, we repaid and terminated one of our synthetic lease facilities for a total cash payment of $203 million, reducing principal debt and minority interest by $191 million and $10 million, respectively. Also, we utilized $1.0 billion in cash and $700 million in credit facility borrowings for scheduled repayments of public notes. 58  During 2006, we paid $413 million related to acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired, including a net $200 million and a net $123 million related to the previously discussed acquisitions of Confluent and Floreane, respectively, within Tycos Healthcare segment. We continue to fund capital expenditures to improve the cost structure of our businesses, to invest in new processes and technology, and to maintain high quality production standards. Capital spending increased to $1.6 billion in 2006 from $1.4 billion in 2005. The level of capital expenditures in 2007 is expected to exceed spending levels in 2006 and is also expected to exceed depreciation. In October 2006, the Company exercised its right to buy five cable laying sea vessels that were previously included under an off balance sheet leasing arrangement for $280 million. This cash paid will be included in capital expenditures for 2007. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, during the year was $862 million. During 2006, we repurchased 95 million of our common shares for $2.5 billion, completing the $1.5 billion share repurchase program previously approved by the Board of Directors in July 2005 and continuing the new $2.0 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in May 2006. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, Tyco paid $373 million, $328 million and $254 million of cash, respectively, to acquire approximately 401,000, 364,000 and 302,000 customer contracts for electronic security services through the ADT dealer program. During 2006, 2005 and 2004 we paid out $68 million, $171 million and $266 million, respectively, in cash related to restructuring activities. These amounts include $7 million, $16 million and $43 million, respectively, reported in discontinued operations. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our restructuring activities. Subsequent to year end, we launched a $600 million company wide restructuring program. We expect to incur approximately $500 million of charges in 2007, and we expect that the total cash expenditures for this program will be approximately $450 million, of which $250 million is expected in 2007. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, we paid $101 million, $48 million and $107 million, respectively, in cash for purchase accounting and holdback liabilities. Of the total cash paid, $82 million, $1 million and $3 million, respectively, was reported in discontinued operations. Holdback liabilities represent a portion of the purchase price withheld from the seller pending finalization of the acquisition balance sheet and other contingencies. At September 29, 2006 holdback liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets were $112 million, of which $23 million are included in accrued and other current liabilities and $89 million are included in other liabilities. At September 29, 2006, $40 million of acquisition liabilities remained on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, of which $14 million are included in accrued and other current liabilities and $26 million are included in other liabilities. As previously mentioned, in January 2006, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a plan to separate the Company into three separate, publicly traded companies. In connection with the Proposed Separation, we paid $96 million in separation costs during 2006. We expect that, during 2007, we will incur the remaining cash outflows related to the Proposed Separation which will be largely attributable to tax restructuring, debt refinancing, professional services and employee related costs. In October 2006, the Company completed the sale of its PCG business, which was part of the Electronics segment, for $226 million and expects to record a gain on the sale of approximately $45 million. 59 Capitalization Shareholders equity was $35.4 billion or $17.78 per share, at September 29, 2006, compared to $32.5 billion or $16.14 per share, at September 30, 2005. This increase was due primarily to net income of $3.7 billion, the exchange of convertible debt due 2018 of $1.2 billion, and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $619 million. These increases were partially offset by the repurchase of common shares by a subsidiary of $2.5 billion as previously mentioned and dividends declared of $807 million. At September 29, 2006, total debt decreased $2.3 billion to $10.2 billion, as compared to $12.5 billion at September 30, 2005. Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization (total debt and shareholders equity) was 22% at September 29, 2006 and 28% at September 30, 2005. Our debt levels significantly decreased as compared to September 30, 2005 primarily due to the redemption of $1.2 billion of our Series A 2.75% convertible senior debentures due 2018 with a 2008 put option, and the scheduled $1.0 billion repayment of our 6.375% public notes. Also, as mentioned, we repaid and terminated one of our synthetic lease facilities reducing our principal debt by $203 million. Our cash balance decreased to $2.9 billion at September 29, 2006, as compared to $3.2 billion at September 30, 2005. The decrease in cash was primarily due to the repurchase of shares under the previously announced programs, and the scheduled debt repayments referred to above, capital expenditures, and to a lesser extent, dividend payments. The majority of these decreases were partially offset by cash flows from operations. TIGSA holds a $1.0 billion 5 year revolving credit facility expiring on December 16, 2009. TIGSA also holds a $1.5 billion 3 year revolving bank credit facility which was amended during 2006 to extend the maturity date from December 22, 2006 to December 21, 2007. Additionally, TIGSA holds a $500 million 3 year unsecured letter of credit facility expiring on June 15, 2007. At September 29, 2006, letters of credit of $475 million have been issued under the $500 million facility and $25 million remains available for issuance. Also, during 2006, TIGSA borrowed $700 million under its $1.5 billion 3 year revolving bank credit facility, with the entire proceeds used to repay its 5.8% public notes due 2006 at their maturity on August 1, 2006. There were no amounts borrowed under the other credit facilities at September 29, 2006. The Companys bank credit agreements contain a number of financial covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization and minimum levels of net worth, and limits on the incurrence of liens. The Companys outstanding indentures contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges, subsidiary debt and sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are presently considered restrictive to the Companys operations. The Company is currently in compliance with all of its debt covenants. As previously discussed, in May 2006, the Board of Directors approved a new $2.0 billion share repurchase program. Pursuant to the new program, we may repurchase Tyco shares from time to time in open market purchases at prevailing market prices, in negotiated transactions off the market, or pursuant to an approved 10b5 1 trading plan in accordance with applicable regulations. A Rule 10b5 1 trading plan permits the Company to repurchase its shares during periods when the Company would not normally be active in the trading market due to insider trading laws, provided the plan is adopted when the Company is not aware of material non public information. Under a Rule 10b5 1 trading plan, we would be unable to repurchase shares above a pre determined price per share. Additionally, the maximum number of shares that we may purchase each day would be governed by Rule 10b 18. On December 9, 2004, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend on our common shares from $0.0125 to $0.10 per share. As a result, dividend payments were $806 million in 2006. Following the Proposed Separation, we expect that all three companies will be dividend paying companies. 60 Also, following the Proposed Separation, it is anticipated that all three companies will be capitalized to provide financial flexibility to take advantage of future growth opportunities. They are expected to have financial policies, balance sheet and credit metrics that are commensurate with solid investment grade ratings. Tyco will continue to follow financial policies that are consistent with its current credit ratings until the planned transactions take place. The Companys existing debt is expected to be allocated among the three companies or refinanced. Any existing or potential liabilities that cannot be associated with a particular entity will be allocated appropriately to each of the businesses, and a sharing agreement among the three companies will be established. The following table details our debt ratings at September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005: Short Term Long Term Moodys Prime 3 Baa 3 Standard & Poors A2 BBB+ Fitch F2 BBB+ The security ratings set forth above are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.  Commitments and Contingencies Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations and commitments for debt, minimum lease payment obligations under non cancelable operating leases and other obligations at September 29, 2006 is as follows ($ in millions): 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Debt(1) $ 782 $ 820 $ 2,555 $ 14 $ 1,002 $ 4,833 $ 10,006 Capital leases 26 27 22 9 7 76 167 Operating leases 516 405 302 214 158 499 2,094 Purchase obligations(2) 222 24 10 10 7 24 297 Total contractual cash obligations(3) $ 1,546 $ 1,276 $ 2,889 $ 247 $ 1,174 $ 5,432 $ 12,564 (1)Excludes interest. (2)Purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of good and services. (3)Other long term liabilities primarily consist of the following: pension and postretirement costs, income taxes, warranty and environmental liabilities and are excluded from this table. We are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type. The minimum required contributions to our pension plans are expected to be approximately $151 million in 2007 and we expect to pay $26 million in 2007 related to postretirement benefit plans. At September 29, 2006, the Company had outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees in the amount of $1.3 billion. At September 29, 2006, TIGSA had unsecured credit facilities of $1.5 billion due December 21, 2007, and $1.0 billion due December 16, 2009, of which $1.8 billion was undrawn and available (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, certain of the Companys operating subsidiaries have uncommitted overdraft and similar types of facilities, which total $624 million, of which $606 million was undrawn and available at September 29, 2006. These facilities expire at various 61 dates through the year 2013, most of which are renewable and are established primarily within our international operations. At September 29, 2006, the Company had a contingent purchase price liability of $80 million related to the 2001 acquisition of Com Net by Electronics. This represents the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of Com Net only after the construction and installation of a communications system for the State of Florida is finished and the State has approved the system based on the guidelines set forth in the contract. A liability for this contingency has not been recorded in Tycos Consolidated Financial Statements as the outcome of this contingency cannot be reasonably determined. In June 2004, TIGSA entered into a $500 million 3 year unsecured letter of credit facility due June 15, 2007. The facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit, supported by a related line of credit facility. TIGSA may only borrow under the line of credit agreement to reimburse the bank for obligations with respect to letters of credit issued under this facility. The covenants under this facility are substantially similar to TIGSAs bank credit facilities entered into during December 2003 and the indenture related to TIGSAs 6% notes due 2013 issued in November 2003. TIGSA would pay interest on any outstanding borrowings at a variable interest rate, based on the banks base rate or the Eurodollar rate, as defined. Upon the occurrence of certain credit events, the interest rate on the outstanding borrowings becomes fixed. The issuance of letters of credit under this credit facility during 2004 enabled the Company to release approximately $480 million of restricted cash and investments. As of September 29, 2006, letters of credit of $475 million have been issued under the $500 million credit facility and $25 million remains available for issuance. There were no amounts borrowed under this credit facility at September 29, 2006. In the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Legal Matters Class Actions For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos securities class actions, shareholder derivative litigation, ERISA litigation and investigation, and litigation against former senior management, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings. We are generally obligated to indemnify our directors and officers and our former directors and officers who are named as defendants in some or all of these matters to the extent required by Bermuda law. In addition, our insurance carriers may decline coverage, or our coverage may be insufficient to cover our expenses and liability, in some or all of these matters. While we may from time to time seek to engage plaintiffs counsel in settlement discussions, we are unable at this time to estimate what our ultimate liability in these matters may be, and it is possible that we will be required to pay judgments or settlements and incur expenses, in excess of any insurance coverage, in aggregate amounts that would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or probable losses, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters. Investigations For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to governmental investigations related to Tyco see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Subpoenas and Document Requests From Governmental Entities. We cannot predict when these investigations will be completed, nor can we predict what the results of these investigations may be. It is possible that we will be required to pay material fines, consent to injunctions on future conduct, lose the ability to conduct business with government instrumentalities 62 (which in turn could negatively impact our business with non governmental customers) or suffer other penalties, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. It is not possible to estimate the amount of loss, or range of possible loss, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters. On April 17, 2006, the Company reached a settlement that closes the SEC Enforcement Divisions investigation of the Company regarding certain accounting practices and other actions by former Tyco officers. On April 25, 2006, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in which the Company was ordered to pay $1 in disgorgement and a fine of $50 million. During the third quarter of 2006, the Company satisfied the judgment which was accrued in 2005. Intellectual Property and Antitrust Litigation The Company is party to a number of patent infringement and antitrust actions that may require the Company to pay damage awards. Tyco has assessed the status of these matters and has recorded liabilities related to certain of these matters where appropriate. For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos intellectual property and antitrust litigation, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Intellectual Property and Antitrust Litigation. Environmental Matters For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos environmental matters, see Item 1. Business Environmental Matters. Asbestos Matters Tyco and some of its subsidiaries are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials. Consistent with the national trend of increased asbestos related litigation, the Company has observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits in the past several years. The majority of these cases have been filed against subsidiaries in Healthcare and Engineered Products and Services. A limited number of the cases allege premises liability, based on claims that individuals were exposed to asbestos while on a subsidiarys property. A majority of the cases involve product liability claims, based principally on allegations of past distribution of heat resistant industrial products incorporating asbestos or the past distribution of industrial valves that incorporated asbestos containing gaskets or packing. Each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants. Tycos involvement in asbestos cases has been limited because its subsidiaries did not mine or produce asbestos. Furthermore, in the Companys experience, a large percentage of these claims were never substantiated and have been dismissed by the courts. The Company will continue to vigorously defend these lawsuits and the Company has not suffered an adverse verdict in a trial court proceeding related to asbestos claims. When appropriate, the Company settles claims; however, the total amount paid in any year to settle and defend all asbestos claims has been immaterial. As of September 29, 2006, there were approximately 15,500 asbestos liability cases pending against the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company estimates its pending asbestos claims that were incurred but not reported, as well as related insurance and indemnification recoveries. The Companys estimate of the liability for pending and future claims is based on claim experience over the past five years and covers claims expected to be filed over the next seven years. The Company believes that it has adequate amounts recorded related to these matters. While it is not possible at this time to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome of these asbestos related proceedings, the Company believes that the final outcome of all 63 known and anticipated future claims, after taking into account its substantial indemnification rights and insurance coverage, will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Income Taxes Tyco and its subsidiaries income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. In connection with such examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. The Company is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies that management has assessed as probable and estimable have been recorded. While the timing and ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain, the Company anticipates that certain of these matters could be resolved during 2007. Compliance Matters Tyco has received and responded to various allegations that certain improper payments were made by Tyco subsidiaries in recent years. During 2005, Tyco reported to the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the SEC the investigative steps and remedial measures that it has taken in response to the allegations. Tyco also informed the DOJ and the SEC that it has retained outside counsel to perform a company wide baseline review of its policies, controls and practices with respect to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, that it would continue to make periodic progress reports to these agencies, and that it would present its factual findings upon conclusion of the baseline review. The Company has and will continue to have communications with the DOJ and SEC to provide updates on the baseline review being conducted by outside counsel, including, as appropriate, briefings concerning additional instances of potential improper payments identified by the Company in the course of its ongoing compliance activities. At this time, Tyco cannot predict the outcome of these matters reported to regulatory and law enforcement authorities and therefore cannot estimate the range of potential loss or extent of risk, if any, that may result from an adverse resolution of any or all of these matters. Other Matters The Company is a party to a contract dispute arising from Earth Techs contract with the City of Phoenix, Arizona for the expansion of the Citys 91st Avenue Waste Water Treatment Plant. Both Earth Tech and the City of Phoenix have filed lawsuits in the local county superior court alleging the other party has breached the contract. At this time, Tyco cannot predict the outcome of this matter and therefore cannot estimate the range of potential loss or extent of risk, if any, that may result from an adverse resolution of this matter. For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos other legal matters, see Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company is a defendant in a number of other pending legal proceedings incidental to present and former operations, acquisitions and dispositions. The Company does not expect the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Backlog At September 29, 2006, we had a backlog of unfilled orders of $14.2 billion, compared to a backlog of $13.5 billion at September 30, 2005. We expect that approximately 77% of our backlog at 64 September 29, 2006 will be filled during 2007. Backlog by reportable industry segment at September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005 is as follows ($ in millions): 2006 2005 Fire and Security $ 7,000 $ 6,732 Engineered Products and Services 4,167 4,007 Electronics 2,711 2,496 Healthcare 280 272 $ 14,158 $ 13,507 Within Fire and Security, backlog increased primarily as a result of strong bookings in North America and Europe. Backlog for Fire and Security includes recurring revenue in force, which represents twelve months fees for monitoring and maintenance services under contract in the security business. The amount of recurring revenue in force at September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005 was $3.65 billion and $3.55 billion, respectively. Backlog within Engineered Products and Services increased primarily as a result of increased orders at Flow Control. Within Electronics, backlog increased as a result of increased bookings in most key end markets. Backlog in Healthcare represents unfilled orders, which, in the nature of the business, are normally shipped shortly after purchase orders are received. We do not view backlog in Healthcare to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale of Accounts Receivable Tyco utilized several programs under which it sold participating interests in accounts receivable to investors who, in turn, purchased and received ownership and security interests in those receivables. These transactions qualified as true sales. The sale proceeds were less than the face amount of accounts receivable sold, and the discount from the face amount was included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Such discount aggregated $18 million, or 3.1% of the weighted average balance of the receivables outstanding, during 2004. During 2004, the Company reduced outstanding balances under its accounts receivable programs by $929 million, of which $812 million related to its corporate accounts receivable programs which were terminated in 2005. No amounts were utilized under these programs at September 30, 2004, and through the date of termination. The remaining reduction of $117 million related to certain of the Companys international businesses selling fewer accounts receivable as a short term financing mechanism. The aggregate amount outstanding under the Companys remaining international accounts receivable programs was $75 million and $80 million at September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005, respectively. Guarantees Certain of the Companys business segments have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from 2007 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In disposing of assets or businesses, the Company often provides representations, warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental 65 contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. The Company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the Company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item I. Business Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. The Company had an off balance sheet leasing arrangement for five cable laying sea vessels. Upon expiration of this lease in October 2006, a subsidiary of the Company has the option to buy these vessels for approximately $280 million, or return the vessels to the lessor and, under a residual guarantee, pay any shortfall in sales proceeds to the lessor from a third party in an amount not to exceed $235 million. As of September 29, 2006, the Company expected this obligation to be $54 million, which is recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, based on an estimate of the fair value of the vessels performed by management with the assistance of a third party valuation. In October 2006, the Company exercised its option to buy these vessels for $280 million. See Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company records estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. For further information on estimated product warranty, see Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2001, Engineered Products and Services initiated a Voluntary Replacement Program ("VRP") associated with the acquisition of Central Sprinkler. The VRP relates to the replacement of certain Model GB fire sprinkler heads which were originally manufactured by Central Sprinkler prior to Tycos acquisition. Under this program, the sprinkler heads are being replaced over a 5 7 year period free of charge to property owners. In the third quarter of 2006, the Company completed a comprehensive review of reported claims, recent claim rates and cost trends and further assessed the future of the program. The Company determined that an additional liability was necessary in order to satisfy the Companys obligation under the VRP. As a result, the Company recorded a $100 million charge which was reflected in cost of sales. Settlements during 2006 include cash expenditures of $37 million related to the VRP. 66   Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Effective October 1, 2005, Tyco adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123R, "Share Based Payment," which requires compensation costs related to share based transactions, including employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on fair value. SFAS No. 123R revises SFAS No. 123, as amended, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," and supersedes Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." Tyco adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective application transition method. Under this method, compensation cost is recognized for the unvested portion of share based payments granted prior to October 1, 2005 and all share based payments granted subsequent to September 30, 2005 over the related vesting period. Prior to October 1, 2005, the Company applied the intrinsic value based method prescribed in APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting for employee stock based compensation. Prior period results have not been restated. Due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Companys results from continuing operations for 2006 include incremental share based compensation expense totaling $161 million. As such, basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were impacted by $0.06 and $0.05, respectively, in 2006. On November 10, 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 123R 3, "Transition Election Related to Accounting for Tax Effects of Share Based Payment Awards." The Company elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in the FASB Staff Position for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to SFAS No. 123R in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool ("APIC pool") related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC pool and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of the tax effects of employee stock based compensation awards that are fully vested and outstanding upon adoption of SFAS No. 123R. The adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. The Company adopted FASB Interpretation ("FIN") No. 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143," during the fourth quarter of 2006. This Interpretation clarifies the timing of liability recognition for legal obligations associated with an asset retirement when the timing and (or) method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN No. 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. The Interpretation requires that conditional asset retirement obligations, along with the associated capitalized asset retirement costs, be reported at their fair values. Upon adoption, the Company recognized a liability of $32 million for asset retirement obligations and an increase of $10 million in the carrying amount of the related assets. The initial recognition resulted in a cumulative effect of accounting change of $22 million, pre tax, reflecting the accumulated depreciation and accretion that would have been recognized in prior periods had the provisions of FIN No. 47 been in effect at the time. Certain obligations relating to the handling and disposal of asbestos have not been recorded due to the fact that fair value cannot be reasonably estimated because the Company does not have sufficient information about the range of time over which the obligation may be settled. The undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset retirement obligations that have not been recognized in the financial statements are approximately $8 million. The Company will continue to monitor such legal asset retirement obligations and recognize a liability in the period sufficient information becomes available to reasonably estimate the fair value. In June 2005, the FASB issued Staff Position ("FSP") No. 143 1, "Accounting for Electronic Equipment Waste Obligations," which provides guidance on accounting for historical waste obligations associated with the European Union Waste, Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive ("WEEE Directive"). Under the directive, the waste management obligation for historical equipment (products 67 put on the market on or prior to August 13, 2005) remains with the commercial user until the equipment is replaced, at which time the waste management obligation may be transferred to the producer of the replacement equipment. FSP No. 143 1 is effective for the first reporting period ending after June 8, 2005 or the date of the adoption of the WEEE Directive into law by the applicable European Union member country. The financial statement impact depends heavily on the respective laws and regulations adopted by the EU member countries, their implementation guidance and the type of recycling programs and systems that are established. The Company evaluated the effects of FSP No. 143 1 and determined that it did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)." SFAS No. 158 requires that employers recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as a net asset or liability on the balance sheet and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. Under SFAS No. 158, companies are required to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of their fiscal year end. The Company presently uses a measurement date of August 31st. SFAS No. 158 also requires additional disclosure in the notes to the financial statements. The recognition provisions of SFAS No. 158 are effective for fiscal 2007, while the measurement date provisions become effective in fiscal 2009. The Company is currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 158 on its consolidated financial statements. Based on the funded status of defined benefit and other postretirement plans as of September 29, 2006, the Company estimates that it would recognize a net $356 million liability through a reduction in shareholders equity. The ultimate amounts recorded are highly dependent on various estimates and assumptions including, among other things, the discount rate selected, future compensation levels and performance of plan assets. Changes in these assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated impact of implementing SFAS No. 158. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements," which enhances existing guidance for measuring assets and liabilities at fair value. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for Tyco beginning September 29, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, that SFAS No. 157 will have on the results of its operations, financial position or cash flows. In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 108, "Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statement." SAB No. 108 requires that companies utilize a "dual approach" to assessing the quantitative effects of financial statement misstatements. The dual approach includes both an income statement focused and balance sheet focused assessment. SAB No. 108 is applicable for Tycos fiscal year ending September 28, 2007. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of SAB No. 108, but does not expect that it will have a significant impact on its financial position or results of operations. In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109." This Interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. FIN No. 48 is effective for Tyco in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The Company is currently assessing the impact that FIN No. 48 will have on the results of its operations, financial position or cash flows. 68  Forward Looking Information Certain statements in this report are "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. All statements contained herein that are not clearly historical in nature are forward looking, and the words "anticipate," "believe," "expect," "estimate," "project" and similar expressions are generally intended to identify forward looking statements. Any forward looking statement contained herein, in press releases, written statements or other documents filed with the SEC, or in Tycos communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, web casts, phone calls and conference calls, regarding expectations with respect to sales, earnings, cash flows, operating efficiencies, product expansion, backlog, the consummation and benefits of acquisitions and divestitures, the Proposed Separation or other matters, as well as financings and repurchases of debt or equity securities, are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and contingencies. Many of these risks, uncertainties and contingencies are beyond our control, and may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from anticipated results, performance or achievements. Factors that might affect such forward looking statements include, among other things: overall economic and business conditions; the demand for Tycos goods and services; competitive factors in the industries in which Tyco competes; changes in tax requirements (including tax rate changes, new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations); results and consequences of Tycos internal investigation and governmental investigations concerning the Companys governance, management, internal controls and operations; the outcome of litigation and governmental proceedings as a result of actions taken by our former senior corporate management; effect of income tax audit settlements; the ratings on our debt and our ability to repay or refinance our outstanding indebtedness as it matures; our ability to operate within the limitations imposed by financing arrangements and to maintain our credit ratings; interest rate fluctuations and other changes in borrowing costs; other capital market conditions, including foreign currency rate fluctuations; availability of and fluctuations in the prices of key raw materials, including steel; economic and political conditions in international markets, including governmental changes and restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders; the ability to achieve cost savings in connection with the Companys strategic restructuring and Six Sigma initiatives; potential further impairment of our goodwill and or our long lived assets; the impact of fluctuations in the price of Tyco common shares; changes in U.S. and non U.S. government regulations in general, and in particular changes in rules and regulations regarding the safety, efficacy, sales, promotions, insurance reimbursement and pricing of Tycos disposable medical products and other specialty products, as well as 69 changes in rules and regulations regarding the retirement and disposal of certain electrical products; the possible effects on Tyco of future legislation in the U.S. that may limit or eliminate potential U.S. tax benefits resulting from Tycos incorporation in Bermuda or deny U.S. government contracts to Tyco based upon its incorporation in Bermuda; and the potential distraction costs associated with negative publicity relating to actions of our former senior corporate management. Additionally, there are several factors and assumptions that could affect the Companys plan to separate into three independent entities, our future results and cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward looking statements: increased demands on the Companys management team as a result of the Proposed Separation; changes in business, political and economic conditions in the U.S. and in other countries in which the Company currently does business; changes in governmental regulations and policies and actions of regulatory bodies; changes in operating performance; required changes to existing financings, and changes in credit ratings, including those that may result from the Proposed Separation; the Companys ability to obtain the financing necessary to consummate the Proposed Separation; and the Companys ability to satisfy certain conditions precedent, including final approval by the Tyco Board of Directors, receipt of certain tax rulings, necessary opinions of counsel and the filing and effectiveness of registration statements with the SEC. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are subject to market risk associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. In order to manage the volatility relating to our more significant market risks, we enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts, cross currency swaps, foreign currency options, and interest rate swaps. We do not anticipate any material changes in our primary market risk exposures in 2007. In assessing the current and future risk related to movements in interest rates, we terminated the interest rate and cross currency swaps in several tranches. The aggregate notional value of the interest rate and cross currency swaps terminated during the fourth quarter of 2006 was $2.5 billion. In October 2006, we terminated the remaining contracts with a total notional amount of $0.6 billion. The settlement of these swaps resulted in a net cash inflow of $55 million. Since the interest rate swaps were designated as hedging instruments of outstanding debt, the related $32 million loss adjustment to the carrying value of the related debt will be amortized over the remaining life of the related debt instruments. In December 2006, due to required changes to the legal entity structure to facilitate the Proposed Separation, the Company determined that it will no longer consider certain intercompany foreign currency transactions to be long term investments. As a result, the related foreign currency transaction gains and losses on such investments will be recorded in the income statement rather than to the currency translation component of shareholders equity. Forward contracts that were previously designated as hedges of these net investments will continue to be used to manage this exposure but will no longer be designated as net investment hedges. 70 We utilize established risk management policies and procedures in executing derivative financial instrument transactions. We do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Derivative financial instruments related to interest rate sensitivity of debt obligations, intercompany cross border transactions and anticipated non functional currency cash flows, are used with the goal of mitigating a significant portion of these exposures when it is cost effective to do so. Counterparties to derivative financial instruments are limited to financial institutions with at least an A/A2 long term debt rating. Interest Rate Sensitivity The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, including debt obligations and interest rate swaps. For debt obligations, the table presents cash flows of principal repayment and weighted average interest rates. For interest rate and cross currency swaps, the table presents notional amounts at the current market price rate and weighted average interest rates. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations including the effects of the restatement described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements should be read together with the Selected Financial Data and our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements due to many factors, including but not limited to those under the headings "Risk Factors" and "Forward Looking Information." Introduction The Consolidated Financial Statements include the consolidated accounts of Tyco International Ltd., a company organized under the laws of Bermuda, and its subsidiaries (hereinafter collectively referred to as "we," the "Company" or "Tyco") and have been prepared in United States dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Company operates in the following business segments: Electronics designs, manufactures and distributes electrical and electronic components and related solutions; Fire and Security designs, manufactures, installs, monitors and services electronic security and fire protection systems; Healthcare designs, manufactures and distributes medical devices and supplies, imaging agents, pharmaceuticals and adult incontinence and infant care products; and Engineered Products and Services designs, manufactures, distributes and services engineered products, including industrial valves and controls, as well as steel tubular goods, and provides consulting, engineering and construction management and operating services. The operating results of the Tyco Global Network ("TGN") business are presented within Corporate through the date of its disposal in the third quarter of 2005. Restatement Review of Prior Period Stock Option Grant Practices Following publicity in 2006 regarding the granting of stock options at a number of companies, the Company initiated an internal review of its historical stock option grant practices to determine whether the Companys stock option award actions were appropriately governed and were accurately reflected in the Companys financial statements. The Companys Internal Audit staff, which reports directly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, began a review of the Companys equity incentive plan practices and associated approvals over the period October 1999 through June 2006. In addition to its review of plan administration, the Internal Audit staff performed detailed audit procedures on more than 95% of share options granted through the regular and off cycle grants during this period. The audit procedures covered 100% of named executive officers and Section 16 officers and directors. The Companys review included an evaluation of grant authorizations, an assessment of the appropriate measurement dates under Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and the application of appropriate equity pricing methodology. The Company has determined that between October 1999 and 2002, there were several grants for which complete documentation was not available. As such, validation of the appropriate measurement date under APB Opinion No. 25 was difficult to determine with precision. For such grants, the Company determined an appropriate measurement date in reliance upon all available evidence and 38 consideration of alternatives, including the communication date to grantees for all grants, to establish a reasonable date upon which equity recipients and share awards were known, fixed and ready to be communicated to employees. To the extent the Company was able to conclude that grant date lists were fixed and ready to be communicated to employees, the measurement date was considered to be the grant date. However, in many instances, the measurement date the Company used was the date that the equity award was communicated to the recipient. The Company has concluded that errors relating to the Companys stock option accounting primarily resulted from: (a) incomplete documentation to enable application of accounting principles under APB Opinion No. 25; (b) the unintentional misapplication of generally accepted accounting principles; and (c) the absence of adequate control procedures in 1999 through early 2002 designed to ensure equity recipients and share awards were fixed and certain prior to the legal grant date. The amount of aggregate compensation expense related to this item, which the Company should have recorded in prior periods, is $252 million pre tax and $173 million after tax, relating to grants awarded prior to the end of 2002. None of this amount relates to 2006, $17 million pre tax ($8 million after tax) relates to 2005 and $66 million pre tax ($46 million after tax) relates to 2004, as awards vested over the relevant vesting periods. Had the Company used the communication date as the measurement date in all instances, the difference in the amount recorded would not have been material to any period or in the aggregate. Review of Equity Plan Compliance Separately, the Company identified an error related to the recognition of compensation expense under the Companys employee stock purchase program in the United Kingdom. The aggregate compensation expense related to this item which the Company should have recorded in 2002 2005 is $29 million pre tax and $20 million after tax. None of this amount relates to 2006, $7 million pre tax ($5 million after tax) relates to 2005 and $19 million pre tax ($13 million after tax) relates to 2004. Effect of Restatement Taken together, these prior period errors result in an aggregate understatement of compensation expense of $281 million pre tax and $193 million after tax. Based on the findings of the items discussed above, the Company has restated its reported results for prior periods to reflect the impact of additional stock based compensation expense in Corporate. The impact by year is as follows ($ in millions): 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 and Prior Total Pre tax impact $ 24 $ 85 $ 84 $ 75 $ 13 $ 281 After tax impact $ 13 $ 59 $ 59 $ 53 $ 9 $ 193 The impact on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, and the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2005, as a result of the above restatement, is summarized in the tables below. There was no impact on total cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended September 30, 2005 and 2004. The amounts previously reported are derived from the 39 Form 10 K for the year ended September 30, 2005 filed on December 9, 2005 and have been reclassified for the effects of discontinued operations.

Overview As previously reported in our periodic filings, on January 13, 2006, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a plan to separate the Company into three separate, publicly traded companies Tyco Healthcare, one of the worlds leading diversified healthcare companies; Tyco Electronics, the worlds largest passive electronic components manufacturer; and a combination of Tyco Fire and Security and Engineered Products and Services, a global business with leading positions in residential and commercial security, fire protection, and industrial products and services (the "Proposed Separation"). After thorough reviews of strategic options with our Board of Directors, we believe that this strategy is the best way to position our market leading companies for sustained growth and value creation. Following the Proposed Separation, Tycos shareholders will own 100% of the equity in all three companies through tax free stock dividends. Each company will have its own independent Board of 41 Directors and strong corporate governance standards. We expect to file Registration Statements in connection with the Proposed Separation during the second quarter of 2007. In connection with the Proposed Separation, the Company continues to estimate that the net economic cost to complete the transaction is expected to approximate $1.0 billion, largely for tax restructuring, debt refinancing, professional services and employee related costs. Depending on prevailing market conditions through the date of the Proposed Separation, the Company anticipates that the corresponding income statement charges would be larger than net economic cost to complete the Proposed Separation. The difference between the income statement charges and the estimated net economic cost is expected to result from costs to retire, refinance or reassign debt, as well as non cash charges. During 2006, the Company incurred $169 million of costs related to the Proposed Separation primarily related to legal, accounting and consulting work associated with executing the transaction. Consummation of the Proposed Separation is subject to certain conditions, including final approval by the Tyco Board of Directors, receipt of certain tax rulings, necessary opinions of counsel, the filing and effectiveness of registration statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the completion of any necessary debt refinancings. Approval by the Companys shareholders is not required as a condition to the consummation of the Proposed Separation. Tyco has received an initial private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Proposed Separation noting it will qualify for favorable tax treatment. We are focused on growing profitability within each of these companies before and after the Proposed Separation, so that each may be well positioned for long term growth as independent entities. Following the Proposed Separation, we expect that all three companies will be dividend paying companies. As we prepare for the Proposed Separation, we remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. During 2006, we repurchased 95 million of our common shares for $2.5 billion under our share repurchase programs. We completed the $1.5 billion share repurchase program previously approved by the Board of Directors with the repurchase of 45 million of our common shares for $1.2 billion and we repurchased an additional 50 million of our common shares for $1.3 billion under the new $2.0 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in May 2006. We have $659 million remaining on the $2.0 billion share repurchase program which we expect to complete prior to the Proposed Separation. During 2006, holders of Tyco International Group S.A., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company organized under the laws of Luxembourg ("TIGSA") Series A 2.75% convertible senior debentures due 2018 with a 2008 put option converted $1.2 billion of these debentures into 54 million Tyco common shares and redeemed the remaining $1 million principal amount outstanding with cash. Additionally, we utilized $1.0 billion in cash for a scheduled repayment of public notes and terminated one of our synthetic lease facilities for a total cash payment of $203 million, reducing principal debt and minority interest by $191 million and $10 million, respectively. In October 2006, we exercised our right to buy five cable laying sea vessels that were previously included under an off balance sheet leasing arrangement for $280 million. During 2006, we completed the sale of our Plastics and Adhesives segment. Our Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses were sold for net proceeds of $882 million and the A&E Products Group was sold for net proceeds of $2 million. During 2006, the Company also recorded a $30 million receivable due from the purchaser of the Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses based on the decline of average resin prices during fiscal year 2006, as contemplated in the definitive sale agreement. This amount is payable to Tyco no later than January 2007. Additionally, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell Printed Circuit Group ("PCG"), a Tyco Electronics business and leading manufacturer of high technology printed circuit boards for the military, aerospace and commercial markets, for $226 million. This transaction was completed on October 27, 2006 and a gain on sale of approximately $45 million is expected. As such, the operations of our Plastics and Adhesives 42 segment and PCG business are reflected as discontinued operations in all periods presented. Details related to the Companys divestiture program and the related discontinued operations are discussed in "Discontinued Operations and Divestitures." We are continuing to assess the strategic fit of our various businesses and are considering additional divestitures where businesses do not align with our long term vision. To further improve operating efficiency, during the first quarter of 2007, we have launched a restructuring program across all segments including the corporate organization which will streamline some of the businesses and reduce our operational footprint. We expect to incur charges of approximately $600 million over the next two years, of which $500 million is expected to be incurred in 2007. We expect that the total cash expenditures for this program will be approximately $450 million, of which $250 million is expected in 2007. We believe this restructuring program will strengthen our competitive position over the long term. Operating Results Net revenue and net income for the years ended September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005 and 2004, as restated, was as follows ($ in millions): 2006 2005 (Restated) 2004 (Restated) Revenue from product sales $ 33,146 $ 31,533 $ 29,886 Service revenue 7,814 7,772 8,074 Net revenue $ 40,960 $ 39,305 $ 37,960 Operating income $ 5,474 $ 5,768 $ 5,146 Interest income 134 123 91 Interest expense (713 ) (815 ) (956 ) Other expense, net (11 ) (911 ) (286 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest 4,884 4,165 3,995 Income taxes (799 ) (1,112 ) (1,112 ) Minority interest (10 ) (9 ) (14 ) Income from continuing operations 4,075 3,044 2,869 Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes (348 ) (46 ) (49 ) Income before cumulative effect of accounting change 3,727 2,998 2,820 Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of income taxes (14 ) 21 Net income $ 3,713 $ 3,019 $ 2,820 Net revenue increased $1.7 billion, or 4.2%, for 2006 as compared to 2005, as a result of growth in all segments, led by Electronics and Engineered Products and Services. Foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures negatively impacted 2006 revenue growth by $326 million and $125 million, respectively. Operating income decreased $294 million, or 5.1%, for 2006 while operating margin decreased 1.3 percentage points to 13.4%. Operating income for 2006 was unfavorably impacted by charges of $426 million, consisting of separation costs of $169 million; incremental stock option charges of $161 million as required under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123R, "Share Based Payment," charges of $63 million related to purchased in process research and development and net restructuring and impairment charges of $33 million, of which $6 million is included in cost of sales. Operating income for 2006 also included net gains and impairments on divestitures of $44 million, $72 million of income related to a settlement with a former executive and 43 $48 million of income resulting from a reduction in our estimated workers compensation liabilities primarily due to favorable claims experience. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected operating income by $52 million. Net revenue increased $1.3 billion, or 3.5%, for 2005 as compared to 2004, which resulted from growth in all segments. Foreign currency exchange rates favorably affected 2005 by $873 million while the impact of divestitures and acquisitions negatively impacted the period by $689 million. Operating income increased $622 million, or 12.1%, for 2005 while operating margin increased 1.1 percentage point to 14.7%. Operating income for 2005 was favorably impacted by the gain on the sale of the TGN business of $301 million. In addition, the year was unfavorably impacted by charges related to an adverse decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on a patent dispute in the Healthcare segment of $277 million, a charge related to an SEC enforcement action of $50 million and a charge relating to former executives employment of $70 million. Foreign currency exchange rates favorably affected operating income by $142 million. Results by Geographic Area Net revenue by geographic area for the years ended September 29, 2006, September 30, 2005 and 2004 was as follows ($ in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Net revenue: United States $ 19,985 $ 19,298 $ 19,254 Other Americas 2,494 2,202 2,103 Europe 11,498 11,407 10,830 Asia Pacific 6,983 6,398 5,773 Net revenue(1) $ 40,960 $ 39,305 $ 37,960 (1)Revenue from external customers is attributed to individual countries based on the reporting entity that records the transaction. Segment Results The segment discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in results for each segment included in continuing operations. Electronics Net revenue, operating income and operating margin for Electronics for the years ended September 29, 2006, September 30, 2005 and 2004 were as follows ($ in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Revenue from product sales $ 12,515 $ 11,620 $ 10,921 Service revenue 209 154 450 Net revenue $ 12,724 $ 11,774 $ 11,371 Operating income $ 1,808 $ 1,849 $ 1,744 Operating margin 14.2 % 15.7 % 15.3 % Net revenue for Electronics increased $950 million or 8.1% in 2006 as compared to 2005, including a 7.7% increase in product revenue. The increase in net revenue reflects broad based volume growth across most customer end markets, especially premise wiring, industrial machinery and equipment, consumer electronics, communications equipment manufacturing and communication service provider markets. These increases were partially offset by the impact of unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $148 million. 44  Operating income and operating margin for 2006 decreased as compared to 2005 due primarily to increased material costs of $306 million, incremental stock option charges of $40 million required under SFAS No. 123R and negative changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $23 million. Additionally, operating income for 2006 included net restructuring, divestiture and impairment charges of $16 million, of which $6 million is reflected in cost of sales, as compared to net restructuring and other credits of $10 million in 2005, discussed below. Operating income for 2006 also includes $3 million related to the Proposed Separation. Net revenue for Electronics increased $403 million or 3.5% in 2005 as compared to 2004, including a 6.4% increase in product revenue. The increase in net revenue was driven primarily by sales to the automotive, aerospace and defense, consumer electronics, power utilities, communications equipment manufacturing and communication service provider markets. In addition, revenue increased substantially due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $291 million. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the divestiture of the Electrical Contracting Services business of $353 million. Operating income and operating margin for 2005 increased as compared to 2004 due primarily to increased sales volume, cost savings initiatives and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $57 million. These increases were partially offset by an 80 basis point impact of increased commodity costs. Additionally, operating income for 2005 included net restructuring and other credits of $10 million, as compared to net restructuring, divestiture and impairment charges of $20 million in 2004. Fire and Security Net revenue, operating income and operating margin for Fire and Security for the years ended September 29, 2006, September 30, 2005 and 2004 were as follows ($ in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Revenue from product sales $ 5,426 $ 5,299 $ 5,343 Service revenue 6,227 6,204 6,104 Net revenue $ 11,653 $ 11,503 $ 11,447 Operating income $ 1,190 $ 1,216 $ 899 Operating margin 10.2 % 10.6 % 7.9 % Net revenue for Fire and Security increased $150 million or 1.3% in 2006 as compared to 2005, including a 2.4% increase in product revenue. Revenue from product sales includes sales and installation of security, fire protection and other systems. Net revenue increased due to growth in Worldwide Fire Protection Contracting and Services primarily related to electrical and mechanical contracting as well as growth in the North American and international markets in our Worldwide Electronic Security Services. These increases were offset by the impact of acquisitions and divestitures of $117 million, unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $60 million, and a decrease in sales of breathing and fire detection products within Safety Products. Operating income decreased $26 million in 2006 over the prior year primarily as a result of lower margins, increased investments in selling and marketing and a decline in European recurring monitoring revenues within Worldwide Electronic Security Services. Results for the current period included net restructuring, impairment and divestiture charges of $11 million as compared to net restructuring, impairment and divestiture charges of $28 million in 2005. Operating income for 2006 was favorably impacted by cost savings related to operational excellence initiatives and prior year restructuring programs. In addition, 2006 operating income was unfavorably impacted by $2 million 45 related to the Proposed Separation as well as incremental stock option charges of $35 million required under SFAS No. 123R. Attrition rates for customers in our Worldwide Electronic Security Services business decreased to 13.8% on a trailing twelve month basis for 2006, as compared to 14.8% for 2005 and 15.1% in 2004. Net revenue for Fire and Security remained relatively level during 2005 as compared to 2004 as the decrease in product revenue was offset by an increase in service revenue. Revenue from product sales includes sales and installation of security, fire protection and other systems. Net revenue increased due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $274 million and, to a lesser extent, increased sales volume of breathing and intrusion products at Tyco Safety Products as well as growth in our European fire services business. These increases were offset by the impact of divestitures of $315 million and decreased sales at our security business in Europe. Operating income increased $317 million in 2005 over the prior year. Results for the current period included net restructuring, impairment and divestiture charges of $28 million as compared to net restructuring, impairment and divestiture charges of $264 million in 2004. Operating income for 2005 was also favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rates of $26 million as well as cost savings related to operational excellence initiatives and prior year restructuring programs. These cost reductions were partially offset by increased investment in sales and marketing. Healthcare Net revenue, operating income and operating margin for Healthcare for the years ended September 29, 2006, September 30, 2005 and 2004 were as follows ($ in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Revenue from product sales $ 9,579 $ 9,477 $ 9,040 Service revenue 62 66 70 Net revenue $ 9,641 $ 9,543 $ 9,110 Operating income $ 2,200 $ 2,286 $ 2,365 Operating margin 22.8 % 24.0 % 26.0 % Net revenue for Healthcare increased $98 million or 1.0% in 2006 as compared to 2005. This increase was largely driven by the International and Surgical divisions within Medical Devices & Supplies as a result of strong growth across the majority of geographic regions in surgical sales including laparoscopy, ablation and vessel sealing, and to a lesser extent, sutures. Also contributing to the revenue increase was volume growth in Bulk Pharmaceuticals (active pharmaceutical ingredients) and Retail, with growth primarily driven by new product sales and distribution, growth in Latin America, as well as favorable economic trends and strategic promotional efforts in key markets. These increases were partially offset by the adverse impact of voluntary product recalls in Imaging and lower volume sales within Respiratory, in addition to the negative changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $93 million. Operating income and operating margin decreased $86 million and 1.2 percentage points, respectively, as compared to 2005. The increased volume in Medical Devices & Supplies, discussed above, was more than offset by unfavorable manufacturing performance primarily in Respiratory and Imaging, as a result of lower volumes and higher expenses primarily associated with voluntary product recalls, as well as weakness in Retail of $40 million. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income, although to a lesser extent, was additional investments in research and development and selling expenses. Operating income was adversely impacted by a charge of $63 million related to purchased in process research and development, incremental stock option charges required under SFAS No. 123R of $37 million, $2 million of charges related to the Proposed Separation and a $31 million negative 46 impact related to foreign currency exchange rates. Additionally, operating income for 2006 included a gain on divestiture of $48 million, primarily relating to a sale of a business within Medical Devices and Supplies. Net revenue for Healthcare increased $433 million or 4.8% in 2005 as compared to 2004. This increase resulted primarily from growth in existing businesses and, to a lesser extent, favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $141 million. Growth in Healthcares underlying businesses was principally driven by increased revenue within Medical Devices & Supplies which was largely the result of increased sales volume in the International division, primarily in Europe, due to a sales force investment and sales growth in vessel sealing, laparoscopy, and stapling. Increased sales at the Surgical division within Medical Devices & Supplies also strongly contributed, due to enhanced contracting with group purchasing organizations, increased acceptance of Laparoscopic Gastric By Pass procedures and increased adoption of LigaSure device. Pharmaceuticals also contributed to the increase in revenue, although to a lesser extent. These increases were partially offset by decreased sales in Retail primarily due to a difficult competitive environment and customer consolidations. The decreases in operating income and operating margin in 2005 as compared to 2004 were due primarily to a $277 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005, associated with the adverse decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on a previously disclosed legal matter. (Refer to Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.) This charge, combined with declines in the Retail division as a result of the competitive environment mentioned above as well as increased material and transportation costs, was offset by substantial increases from other divisions, specifically the International and Surgical divisions within Medical Devices & Supplies as well as within Pharmaceutical. Increases in these divisions were due to strong sales growth as mentioned above, combined with a favorable product mix. Also positively impacting the segment were reduced administrative expenses at the segment level, as well as favorable foreign exchange rates of $41 million. Engineered Products and Services Net revenue, operating income and operating margin for Engineered Products and Services for the years ended September 29, 2006, September 30, 2005 and 2004 were as follows ($ in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Revenue from product sales $ 5,625 $ 5,137 $ 4,582 Service revenue 1,317 1,319 1,425 Net revenue $ 6,942 $ 6,456 $ 6,007 Operating income $ 676 $ 672 $ 620 Operating margin 9.7 % 10.4 % 10.3 % Net revenue for Engineered Products and Services increased $486 million or 7.5% in 2006 as compared to 2005. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by Flow Control as a result of strong project volume in the Pacific Region and favorable market conditions in Asia and North America, as well as increased selling prices in Electrical & Metal Products due to higher costs of copper. To a lesser extent, Tyco Fire & Building Products experienced growth in the industrial and commercial construction markets and increased price realization. The above increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease at Infrastructure Services as a result of a strategic decision to be more selective in bidding for new projects, which has resulted in fewer but more profitable projects, and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $25 million. Operating income remained relatively level in 2006 as compared to 2005. Both the revenue growth at Flow Control and Fire & Building Products, as well as favorable copper spreads in Electrical & 47 Metal Products and higher margin projects at Infrastructure Services contributed positively to operating income in 2006. Offsetting this growth was a $100 million charge relating to the Voluntary Replacement Program for certain sprinkler heads (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and incremental stock option charges of $17 million required under SFAS No. 123R. Net revenue for Engineered Products and Services increased $449 million or 7.5% in 2005 as compared to 2004. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by increased selling prices in Electrical & Metal Products due to higher costs of steel and other raw materials. In addition, Flow Control and, to a lesser extent, Tyco Fire & Building Products experienced growth in the industrial and commercial construction markets. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $167 million also contributed to the increase in revenue. The above increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease at Infrastructure Services as a result of a strategic decision to be more selective in bidding for new projects, which has resulted in fewer but more profitable projects. The increases in operating income and operating margin in 2005 as compared to 2004 were due primarily to increased volume and demand within the industrial and commercial markets, along with the impact of operational excellence initiatives, cost reductions from prior period restructuring programs and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $21 million. These increases more than offset the impact of higher raw material costs. Additionally, 2005 operating income includes $4 million of net restructuring, impairment and divestiture charges as compared to the $62 million of net restructuring, impairment and divestiture charges in 2004. Corporate Corporate net revenue was $29 million and $25 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, which related to the TGN business which was sold in the third quarter of 2005. Corporate expense was $400 million, $255 million and $482 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Corporate expense for 2006 includes $162 million related to the Proposed Separation and incremental stock option charges of $32 million required under SFAS No. 123R. Corporate expense also includes income related to a settlement with a former executive of $72 million as well as $48 million of income resulting from a reduction in our estimated workers compensation liabilities primarily due to favorable claims experience. Operating income for 2005 and 2004 has been restated to reflect additional compensation expense of $24 million and $85 million, respectively, related to the review of prior period stock option grant practices and equity plan compliance. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Corporate expense for 2005 includes a $301 million gain on the sale of the TGN business and TGN operating losses of $54 million. In addition, corporate expenses for 2005 included a $50 million charge representing the fines and penalties that the Company paid to resolve the matters raised in the SEC investigation that commenced in June 2002, as well as a $70 million charge for estimated legacy contingencies related to former executives employment. Corporate expense for 2004 includes net charges of $14 million, which consists of charges for the impairment of long lived assets of $8 million and net restructuring charges of $6 million primarily attributable to severance related to the relocation of the corporate headquarters. Expense also included $73 million of operating losses related to the TGN. Interest Income and Expense Interest income was $134 million in 2006, as compared to $123 million and $91 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Interest expense was $713 million in 2006, as compared to $815 million in 2005 and $956 million in 2004. The decrease in interest expense in 2006 is primarily driven by lower debt balances, partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates on our interest rate swap program as compared to 2005. 48 The decrease in interest expense in 2005 over 2004 is primarily the result of lower debt balances, partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates on our interest rate swap program compared to 2004. The weighted average rates of interest on total debt outstanding during 2006, 2005 and 2004 were 5.9%, 5.6% and 5.2%, respectively. Other Expense, Net During 2006, other expense, net consisted primarily of a loss relating to the write down of certain investments to their net realizable value. During 2005, other expense, net included a loss on the retirement of debt. The Company repurchased $1,241 million principal amount of its outstanding 2.75% convertible senior debentures for $1,823 million and $750 million principal amount of its outstanding 3.125% convertible senior debentures for $1,147 million. These repurchases resulted in a $1,013 million loss on the retirement of debt, including the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs. Also during 2005, other expense, net included income of $109 million related to a court ordered restitution award. On September 12, 2002, indictments were filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York against Mr. L. Dennis Kozlowski, our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Mark H. Swartz, our former Chief Financial Officer and director (together, the "Defendants"), alleging enterprise corruption, fraud, conspiracy, grand larceny, falsifying certain business records and other crimes. On June 17, 2005, a jury convicted the Defendants on 22 of 23 counts in the indictment. On September 19, 2005, the Defendants were sentenced in New York State Supreme Court to serve eight and one third years to twenty five years in prison and to make joint restitution to the Company in the amount of $134 million, resulting from the larceny convictions. The restitution award is comprised of $109 million of previously expensed compensation made to the defendants and reported as other expense, net in prior years and $25 million related to a loan receivable from one of the Defendants which had been and remains reflected in the Companys consolidated financial statements as a receivable. The Defendants have filed a notice of appeal of the convictions. The Company considered the collectibility of the restitution award and assessed the likelihood of the Defendants success upon appeal of the larceny convictions, which, if successful, could result in a change to the restitution order, and has concluded that receipt of the restitution award is probable. The Court ordered the restitution payment to be made by no later than one year from the date of sentencing. Tyco has initiated the process of collecting the restitution payment owed, subject to the pending appeal. During October 2006, the Company received payment of $38 million relating to the restitution and expects to receive the remaining amount in the second quarter of 2007. During 2004, other expense, net consisted primarily of a loss on the retirement of debt. The Company repurchased $303 million of its 7.2% notes due 2008 for cash of $341 million, which resulted in a $38 million loss, including the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs. Additionally, the Company repurchased $517 million of its outstanding 2.75% convertible senior debentures with a 2008 put option. The total purchase price paid was $750 million and the repurchase resulted in a $241 million loss on the retirement of debt, including the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 16.4%, 26.7% and 27.8% for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 2005 to 2006 was primarily the result of additional releases of deferred tax asset valuation allowances, as a result of improved historical and projected profitability in certain jurisdictions, and a $127 million favorable adjustment to correct prior year tax reserves on legacy tax matters. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 2004 to 2005 is primarily the result of the release of valuation allowances, benefits realized related to the TGN divestiture, as well as the court ordered restitution award related to certain former executives for which there is no tax obligation 49 and, to a lesser extent, increased profitability in operations in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. This decrease is partially offset by an increase in charges for which no tax benefit was available such as the loss on retirement of debt, asset impairments and the estimated settlement of the SEC enforcement action. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $1,731 million and $1,871 million at September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," which requires a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is "more likely than not" that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by these taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as payment is not expected within one year. The Company and its subsidiaries income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. In connection with such examinations, tax authorities, including the United States Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. The Company is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies that management has assessed as probable and estimable have been recorded. While the timing and ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain, the Company anticipates that certain of these matters could be resolved during 2007. The IRS continues to audit the years 1997 to 2000. In 2004 the Company submitted to the IRS proposed adjustments to these prior period U.S. federal income tax returns, resulting in a reduction in the taxable income previously filed. During 2006, the IRS accepted substantially all of the proposed adjustments. These adjustments did not have a material impact on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company. During 2006, the Company has developed amendments to U.S. federal income tax returns for additional periods. On the basis of previously accepted amendments, the Company has determined that acceptance of these adjustments is probable and accordingly has recorded them in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such adjustments did not have a material impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Except for earnings that are currently distributed, no additional provision has been made for U.S. or non U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or the Company has concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of distribution of such earnings. A liability could arise if amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries. 50 Discontinued Operations and Divestitures Discontinued Operations During 2006, the Company consummated the sale of the Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses as well as the A&E Product business for $975 million and $6 million in gross cash proceeds, respectively. Working capital and other adjustments resulted in net proceeds of $882 million for the sale of the Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses. During 2006, the Company also recorded a $30 million receivable due from the purchaser of the Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses based on the decline of average resin prices during fiscal year 2006, as contemplated in the definitive sale agreement. This amount is payable to Tyco no later than January 2007. Net cash proceeds received for the sale of the A&E Products business was $2 million, which does not include working capital provisions which are expected to be settled prior to the end of calendar year 2006. Both businesses met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and have been included in discontinued operations in all periods presented. During 2006, the Company recorded a $261 million and $26 million pre tax loss on sale from discontinued operations related to the Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses and A&E Products business, respectively, which include $275 million and $22 million, respectively, of pre tax impairment charges to write the businesses down to their fair values less costs to sell. Fair values used for the respective impairment assessments were based on existing market conditions and the terms and conditions included or expected to be included in the respective sale agreements. During 2006, the Company approved a plan to divest the Printed Circuit Group ("PCG") business, a component of the Electronics segment, and also entered into a definitive sale agreement to sell PCG for $226 million in cash. During 2006, the Company recorded a $4 million pre tax loss on sale from discontinued operations for PCG related to the divestiture of the PCG Spain business as well as certain other costs to sell. The sale of PCG was completed in October 2006 and the Company expects to record a gain on the sale of approximately $45 million. See Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The PCG business met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and has been included in discontinued operations in all periods presented. In 2005, Tyco announced its intent to explore the divesture of its Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses, as well as the A&E Products business, a global manufacturer of plastic film, specialty tapes and adhesives, coated products and garment hangers. As a result of consideration for potential sale and deteriorating operating results in the A&E Products business, the Company performed an interim assessment of the recoverability of both goodwill and long lived assets and determined that the book value of certain long lived assets in the A&E Products business was greater than their estimated fair value and consequently recorded a long lived asset impairment of $40 million and goodwill impairment charge of $162 million. Fair value used for the impairment assessment was based on probability weighted expected future cash flow of the assets. During 2005, the Company divested 8 businesses which were reported as discontinued operations within Fire and Security, Engineered Products and Services and the Plastics and Adhesives business segment. The Company reported losses on sale or additional impairments to write the carrying value of such assets down to their estimated fair value less costs to sell of $60 million during 2005. During 2004, the Company reported losses on the sale of discontinued operations of $132 million to write the carrying value of such assets down to their fair value less cost to sell. For the additional 8 businesses in 2005 and the divested businesses in 2004, fair value used for the impairment assessment was primarily based on the terms and conditions included or expected to be included in the sales agreements. 51 (Gains) losses on divestitures During 2004, the Company divested twenty one and liquidated four non core businesses across all business segments primarily within Fire and Security. During 2004, the Company recorded net losses and impairments on divestitures of $116 million in continuing operations in connection with the divestiture or write down to fair value of certain held for sale businesses. During 2005, Tyco agreed to sell the TGN, its undersea fiber optic telecommunication network. The sale was consummated on June 30, 2005. As part of the sale transaction, Tyco received gross cash proceeds of $130 million, and the purchaser assumed certain liabilities. In connection with this sale, Tyco recorded a $301 million gain which is reflected in (gains) losses on divestitures in the Consolidated Statement of Income for 2005. The Company has presented the operations of the TGN in continuing operations as the criteria for discontinued operations were not met. During 2005, the Company divested 10 businesses that were reported as continuing operations in Fire and Security, Healthcare and Engineered Products and Services. The Company recorded net losses and impairments on divestitures of $32 million, including a $3 million charge reflected in cost of sales, in connection with the divestiture and liquidation of these businesses, as well as the write down to estimated fair value of certain held for sale businesses. During 2006, the Company divested 6 businesses that were reported as continuing operations in Fire and Security and Healthcare. The Company recorded net gains on divestitures of $46 million in connection with the divestiture of these businesses, less $2 million of divestiture charges related to the write down to estimated fair value and costs to sell certain other held for sale businesses. For the divested businesses during 2006, 2005 and 2004, fair value used for the impairment assessment was primarily based on the terms and conditions included or expected to be included in the sales agreements. Acquisitions During 2006, Tycos Healthcare segment acquired over 90% ownership in Floreane Medical Implants, S.A. ("Floreane") for approximately $123 million in cash, net of cash acquired of $3 million. Floreane is an innovator in the development of surgical support implants for parietal, urological and gynecological surgery. The remaining outstanding shares would be acquired if they become available. The Company recorded a $3 million in process research and development charge in conjunction with the acquisition. During 2006, Tycos Healthcare segment also acquired over 50% ownership of Airox S.A. ("Airox") for approximately $59 million, net of cash acquired of $4 million. Airox is a leading European company in the home respiratory ventilation systems business. Tyco expects to acquire the remaining Airox shares in a mandatory tender offer. The initial share purchase and the subsequent tender offer combined are expected to total approximately $108 million. The Company has also recorded an $11 million in process research and development charge in conjunction with the acquisition. The charge relates to the development of second generation technology which has not yet obtained regulatory approval. As of the acquisition date, the in process research and development was not considered to be technologically feasible or to have any alternative future use. During 2006, Tycos Healthcare segment also acquired Confluent Surgical, Inc. ("Confluent"). The total purchase price is expected to be $246 million. As of September 29, 2006, the Company has paid approximately $200 million in cash, net of cash acquired of $12 million. The Company has also deposited approximately $34 million of the total purchase price into an escrow account related to closing balance sheet adjustments and certain indemnifications to be resolved through fiscal 2008. The Company recorded a $49 million in process research and development charge in conjunction with the acquisition related to technology which Confluent is developing for numerous applications across 52 several surgical disciplines which have not yet received regulatory approval. As of the acquisition date, the in process research and development was not considered to be technologically feasible or to have any alternative future use. Cash paid for other acquisitions in 2006 totaled $31 million, net of $8 million cash acquired. In July 2005, Tycos Healthcare segment acquired Vivant Medical Inc. ("Vivant"), a developer of microwave ablation medical technology. The transaction is valued at approximately $66 million cash, with up to approximately $35 million additional cash to be paid in the future based on achieving certain milestones. Cash paid, net of cash acquired, for various other acquisitions totaled $16 million. During 2004, the Company completed the acquisition of two businesses within Engineered Products and Services and Fire and Security for an aggregate cost of $9 million. These acquisitions were funded utilizing cash from operations. The results of operations of the acquired companies have been included in Tycos consolidated results from the respective acquisition dates. These acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change During 2006, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation ("FIN") No. 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143." Accordingly, the Company has recognized asset retirement obligations of $32 million and property, plant and equipment, net of $10 million in its Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 29, 2006. In addition, the Company recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change which resulted in a $14 million after tax loss ($22 million pre tax). Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on FIN No. 47. During 2005, the Company changed the measurement date for its pension and postretirement benefit plans, from September 30th to August 31st, effective October 1, 2004. The Company believes that the one month change of measurement date is a preferable change as it allows management adequate time to evaluate and report the actuarial information in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements under the accelerated reporting deadlines. As a result of this change, the Company recorded a $21 million after tax gain ($28 million pre tax) cumulative effect of accounting change. Refer to Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on retirement plans. Change in Fiscal Year and Reporting Calendar Alignment Effective October 1, 2004, Tyco changed its fiscal year end from a calendar fiscal year ending September 30 to a "52 53 week" year ending on the last Friday of September, such that each quarterly period will be 13 weeks in length. In addition, certain of the Companys subsidiaries had consistently closed their books up to one month prior to the Companys fiscal period end. These subsidiaries now report results for the same period as the reported results of the consolidated Company. The impact of this change was not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Net income for the transition period related to this change was $26 million and was reported within Shareholders Equity during 2005. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 53 assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. Depreciation and Amortization Method for Security Monitoring Systems Tyco generally considers its electronic security assets in three asset pools: internally generated residential systems, internally generated commercial systems and customer accounts acquired through the ADT dealer program. The determination of the depreciable lives of subscriber systems, as defined below, included in property, plant and equipment, and the amortizable lives of customer contracts and related customer relationships included in intangible assets, are primarily based on historical attrition rates, third party lifing studies and the useful life of the underlying tangible asset. The realizable value and remaining useful lives of these assets could be impacted by changes in customer attrition rates. If the attrition rates were to rise, Tyco may be required to accelerate the depreciation and amortization. With respect to Tycos depreciation policy for security monitoring systems installed in residential and commercial customer premises, the costs of these systems are combined in separate pools for internally generated residential and internally generated commercial account customers (collectively "subscriber systems"), and generally depreciated over ten to fourteen years. Tyco concluded that for residential and commercial account pools the straight line method of depreciation over a ten to fourteen year period continues to be appropriate given the observed actual attrition data for these pools. Tyco purchases residential security monitoring contracts from an external network of independent dealers who operate under the ADT dealer program. The purchase price of these customer contracts is recorded as an intangible asset (i.e., contracts and related customer relationships). Intangible assets arising from the ADT dealer program are amortized in pools determined by the month of contract acquisition on an accelerated basis over the period and pattern of economic benefit that is expected to be obtained from the customer relationship. Tyco believes that the accelerated method that presently best achieves the matching objective described above is the double declining balance method based on a ten year life for the first eight years of the estimated life of the customer relationships converting to the straight line method of amortization for the remaining four years of the estimated relationship period. Actual attrition data is regularly reviewed in order to assess the continued applicability of the accelerated method of amortization described above. Attrition rates for customers in our Worldwide Electronic Security Services business were 13.8%, 14.8% and 15.1% on a trailing 12 month basis for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Revenue Recognition Contract sales for the installation of fire protection systems, large security intruder systems, undersea fiber optic cable systems and other construction related projects are recorded primarily on the percentage of completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon contracted revenue and related estimated cost to completion. The risk of this methodology is its dependence upon estimates of costs to completion, which are subject to the uncertainties inherent in long term contracts. Revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they first become determinable. If estimates are inaccurate, there is risk that our revenue and profits for the period may be overstated or understated. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other markets participants. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience and trend analysis. Loss Contingencies Accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings, self insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on 54 judgment, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates. Additionally, the Company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. Income Taxes In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and international pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction. Any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. If a change in a valuation allowance occurs, which was established in connection with an acquisition, such adjustment may impact goodwill rather than the income tax provision. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If the tax liabilities relate to tax uncertainties existing at the date of the acquisition of a business, the adjustment of such tax liabilities will result in an adjustment to the goodwill recorded at the date of acquisition. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually and more frequently if a triggering event occurs. In performing this assessment, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. Since judgment is involved in performing goodwill valuation analyses, there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated or understated. 55 We elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for all reporting units. When testing for goodwill impairment, the Company follows the guidance prescribed in SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." First, the Company performs a step I goodwill impairment test to identify a potential impairment. In doing so, the Company compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and a step II goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. In the step II goodwill impairment test, the Company compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. The Company allocates the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. Disruptions to our business such as end market conditions and protracted economic weakness, unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units, the divestiture of a significant component of a reporting unit and market capitalization declines may result in our having to perform a goodwill impairment first step valuation analysis for some or all of our reporting units prior to the required annual assessment. These types of events and the resulting analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future. There were no goodwill impairments related to continuing operations during 2006, 2005 and 2004. Goodwill impairments included in loss from discontinued operations in 2005 totaled $162 million. Long Lived Assets Assets held and used by the Company, including property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of evaluating the recoverability of long lived assets to be held and used, a recoverability test is performed based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk. Impairments to long lived assets to be disposed of are recorded based upon the fair value of the applicable assets. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of long lived assets, there is a risk that the carrying value of our long lived assets may be overstated or understated. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations. Two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions. The discount rate represents the market rate for high quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our present value of pension obligations by approximately $225 million. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected long term rates of return on those types of plan assets, in determining the expected long term return on plan assets. A 50 basis point decrease in the expected long term return on plan assets would increase our pension expense by approximately $20 million. 56 Liquidity and Capital Resources The sources of our cash flow from operating activities and the use of a portion of that cash in our operations for the years ended September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005 and 2004, as restated, were as follows ($ in millions): 2006 2005 (Restated) 2004 (Restated) Cash flows from operating activities: Operating income $ 5,474 $ 5,768 $ 5,146 Non cash restructuring and asset impairment charges (credits), net 9 (13 ) 16 (Gains) losses on divestitures (44 ) (271 ) 111 In process research and development 63 Depreciation and amortization(1) 2,065 2,084 2,098 Non cash compensation expense 275 99 121 Deferred income taxes 72 (28 ) 167 Provision for losses on accounts receivable and inventory 174 232 317 Other, net(2) (47 ) 148 79 Net increase in working capital (1,069 ) (61 ) (873 ) Interest income 134 123 91 Interest expense (713 ) (815 ) (956 ) Income tax expense (799 ) (1,112 ) (1,112 ) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 5,594 $ 6,154 $ 5,205 Other cash flow items: Capital expenditures, net(3) $ (1,514 ) $ (1,263 ) $ (987 ) Decrease in sale of accounts receivable 9 18 929 Acquisition of customer accounts (ADT dealer program) (373 ) (328 ) (254 ) Purchase accounting and holdback liabilities (19 ) (47 ) (104 ) Voluntary pension contributions 2 115 567 (1)Includes depreciation expense of $1,415 million, $1,431 million and $1,407 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively and amortization of intangible assets of $650 million, $653 million and $691 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. (2)Includes the add back of losses on the retirement of debt of $2 million, $1,013 million and $284 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. (3)Includes net proceeds of $55 million, $91 million and $140 million received for the sale/disposition of property, plant and equipment in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The net change in total working capital was a cash decrease of $1,069 million in 2006. The components of this change are set forth in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The change in working capital included an increase of $680 million in inventories and a $332 million decrease in accrued and other liabilities, primarily related to decreased accrued legal and audit fees, partially offset by an increase in annual employee bonus compensation. The provision for losses on accounts receivable and inventory decreased from $232 million during the year ended September 30, 2005 to $174 million for the current period. This decrease was driven by improvements across all segments, particularly due to improved accounts receivable aging, an overall improved credit profile of the customer base, and better collections. Consequently, our allowance for doubtful accounts decreased from $421 million at September 30, 2005 to $336 million at September 29, 2006. 57 Cash flows from operating activities and other cash flow items by segment for the year ended September 29, 2006 were as follows ($ in millions): Electronics Fire and Security Healthcare Engineered Products and Services Corporate and Other Total Cash flows from operating activities: Operating income (loss) $ 1,808 $ 1,190 $ 2,200 $ 676 $ (400 ) $ 5,474 Non cash restructuring and asset impairment charges, net 3 1 4 1 9 Losses (gains) on divestitures 2 1 (48 ) 1 (44 ) In process research and development 63 63 Depreciation 463 567 270 104 11 1,415 Intangible assets amortization 70 514 64 2 650 Depreciation and amortization 533 1,081 334 106 11 2,065 Non cash compensation expense 65 56 58 26 70 275 Deferred income taxes 72 72 Provision for losses on accounts receivable and inventory 67 31 48 28 174 Net (increase) decrease in working capital and other (92 ) (126 ) (605 ) 25 (318 ) (1,116 ) Interest income 134 134 Interest expense (713 ) (713 ) Income tax expense (799 ) (799 ) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 2,386 $ 2,234 $ 2,054 $ 862 $ (1,942 ) $ 5,594 Other cash flow items: Capital expenditures, net $ (549 ) $ (433 ) $ (429 ) $ (98 ) $ (5 ) $ (1,514 ) Decrease in sale of accounts receivable 9 9 Acquisition of customer accounts (ADT dealer program) (373 ) (373 ) Purchase accounting and holdback liabilities (4 ) (6 ) (8 ) (1 ) (19 ) Voluntary pension contributions 2 2 During 2006, the Company completed the sale of our Plastics and Adhesives segment, previously announced in 2005. Our Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses were sold for net proceeds of $882 million and the A&E Products Group was sold for $2 million in net cash proceeds. During 2006, we made additional cash outflows of approximately $450 million for the resolution of certain previously accrued legal matters, including a patent dispute in the Healthcare segment, and a cash payment of $50 million to settle the previously disclosed SEC enforcement action. We will continue to use excess cash to repurchase shares. During 2006, we repaid and terminated one of our synthetic lease facilities for a total cash payment of $203 million, reducing principal debt and minority interest by $191 million and $10 million, respectively. Also, we utilized $1.0 billion in cash and $700 million in credit facility borrowings for scheduled repayments of public notes. 58  During 2006, we paid $413 million related to acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired, including a net $200 million and a net $123 million related to the previously discussed acquisitions of Confluent and Floreane, respectively, within Tycos Healthcare segment. We continue to fund capital expenditures to improve the cost structure of our businesses, to invest in new processes and technology, and to maintain high quality production standards. Capital spending increased to $1.6 billion in 2006 from $1.4 billion in 2005. The level of capital expenditures in 2007 is expected to exceed spending levels in 2006 and is also expected to exceed depreciation. In October 2006, the Company exercised its right to buy five cable laying sea vessels that were previously included under an off balance sheet leasing arrangement for $280 million. This cash paid will be included in capital expenditures for 2007. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, during the year was $862 million. During 2006, we repurchased 95 million of our common shares for $2.5 billion, completing the $1.5 billion share repurchase program previously approved by the Board of Directors in July 2005 and continuing the new $2.0 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in May 2006. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, Tyco paid $373 million, $328 million and $254 million of cash, respectively, to acquire approximately 401,000, 364,000 and 302,000 customer contracts for electronic security services through the ADT dealer program. During 2006, 2005 and 2004 we paid out $68 million, $171 million and $266 million, respectively, in cash related to restructuring activities. These amounts include $7 million, $16 million and $43 million, respectively, reported in discontinued operations. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our restructuring activities. Subsequent to year end, we launched a $600 million company wide restructuring program. We expect to incur approximately $500 million of charges in 2007, and we expect that the total cash expenditures for this program will be approximately $450 million, of which $250 million is expected in 2007. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, we paid $101 million, $48 million and $107 million, respectively, in cash for purchase accounting and holdback liabilities. Of the total cash paid, $82 million, $1 million and $3 million, respectively, was reported in discontinued operations. Holdback liabilities represent a portion of the purchase price withheld from the seller pending finalization of the acquisition balance sheet and other contingencies. At September 29, 2006 holdback liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets were $112 million, of which $23 million are included in accrued and other current liabilities and $89 million are included in other liabilities. At September 29, 2006, $40 million of acquisition liabilities remained on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, of which $14 million are included in accrued and other current liabilities and $26 million are included in other liabilities. As previously mentioned, in January 2006, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a plan to separate the Company into three separate, publicly traded companies. In connection with the Proposed Separation, we paid $96 million in separation costs during 2006. We expect that, during 2007, we will incur the remaining cash outflows related to the Proposed Separation which will be largely attributable to tax restructuring, debt refinancing, professional services and employee related costs. In October 2006, the Company completed the sale of its PCG business, which was part of the Electronics segment, for $226 million and expects to record a gain on the sale of approximately $45 million. 59 Capitalization Shareholders equity was $35.4 billion or $17.78 per share, at September 29, 2006, compared to $32.5 billion or $16.14 per share, at September 30, 2005. This increase was due primarily to net income of $3.7 billion, the exchange of convertible debt due 2018 of $1.2 billion, and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $619 million. These increases were partially offset by the repurchase of common shares by a subsidiary of $2.5 billion as previously mentioned and dividends declared of $807 million. At September 29, 2006, total debt decreased $2.3 billion to $10.2 billion, as compared to $12.5 billion at September 30, 2005. Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization (total debt and shareholders equity) was 22% at September 29, 2006 and 28% at September 30, 2005. Our debt levels significantly decreased as compared to September 30, 2005 primarily due to the redemption of $1.2 billion of our Series A 2.75% convertible senior debentures due 2018 with a 2008 put option, and the scheduled $1.0 billion repayment of our 6.375% public notes. Also, as mentioned, we repaid and terminated one of our synthetic lease facilities reducing our principal debt by $203 million. Our cash balance decreased to $2.9 billion at September 29, 2006, as compared to $3.2 billion at September 30, 2005. The decrease in cash was primarily due to the repurchase of shares under the previously announced programs, and the scheduled debt repayments referred to above, capital expenditures, and to a lesser extent, dividend payments. The majority of these decreases were partially offset by cash flows from operations. TIGSA holds a $1.0 billion 5 year revolving credit facility expiring on December 16, 2009. TIGSA also holds a $1.5 billion 3 year revolving bank credit facility which was amended during 2006 to extend the maturity date from December 22, 2006 to December 21, 2007. Additionally, TIGSA holds a $500 million 3 year unsecured letter of credit facility expiring on June 15, 2007. At September 29, 2006, letters of credit of $475 million have been issued under the $500 million facility and $25 million remains available for issuance. Also, during 2006, TIGSA borrowed $700 million under its $1.5 billion 3 year revolving bank credit facility, with the entire proceeds used to repay its 5.8% public notes due 2006 at their maturity on August 1, 2006. There were no amounts borrowed under the other credit facilities at September 29, 2006. The Companys bank credit agreements contain a number of financial covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization and minimum levels of net worth, and limits on the incurrence of liens. The Companys outstanding indentures contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges, subsidiary debt and sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are presently considered restrictive to the Companys operations. The Company is currently in compliance with all of its debt covenants. As previously discussed, in May 2006, the Board of Directors approved a new $2.0 billion share repurchase program. Pursuant to the new program, we may repurchase Tyco shares from time to time in open market purchases at prevailing market prices, in negotiated transactions off the market, or pursuant to an approved 10b5 1 trading plan in accordance with applicable regulations. A Rule 10b5 1 trading plan permits the Company to repurchase its shares during periods when the Company would not normally be active in the trading market due to insider trading laws, provided the plan is adopted when the Company is not aware of material non public information. Under a Rule 10b5 1 trading plan, we would be unable to repurchase shares above a pre determined price per share. Additionally, the maximum number of shares that we may purchase each day would be governed by Rule 10b 18. On December 9, 2004, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend on our common shares from $0.0125 to $0.10 per share. As a result, dividend payments were $806 million in 2006. Following the Proposed Separation, we expect that all three companies will be dividend paying companies. 60 Also, following the Proposed Separation, it is anticipated that all three companies will be capitalized to provide financial flexibility to take advantage of future growth opportunities. They are expected to have financial policies, balance sheet and credit metrics that are commensurate with solid investment grade ratings. Tyco will continue to follow financial policies that are consistent with its current credit ratings until the planned transactions take place. The Companys existing debt is expected to be allocated among the three companies or refinanced. Any existing or potential liabilities that cannot be associated with a particular entity will be allocated appropriately to each of the businesses, and a sharing agreement among the three companies will be established. The following table details our debt ratings at September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005: Short Term Long Term Moodys Prime 3 Baa 3 Standard & Poors A2 BBB+ Fitch F2 BBB+ The security ratings set forth above are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.  Commitments and Contingencies Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations and commitments for debt, minimum lease payment obligations under non cancelable operating leases and other obligations at September 29, 2006 is as follows ($ in millions): 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Debt(1) $ 782 $ 820 $ 2,555 $ 14 $ 1,002 $ 4,833 $ 10,006 Capital leases 26 27 22 9 7 76 167 Operating leases 516 405 302 214 158 499 2,094 Purchase obligations(2) 222 24 10 10 7 24 297 Total contractual cash obligations(3) $ 1,546 $ 1,276 $ 2,889 $ 247 $ 1,174 $ 5,432 $ 12,564 (1)Excludes interest. (2)Purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of good and services. (3)Other long term liabilities primarily consist of the following: pension and postretirement costs, income taxes, warranty and environmental liabilities and are excluded from this table. We are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type. The minimum required contributions to our pension plans are expected to be approximately $151 million in 2007 and we expect to pay $26 million in 2007 related to postretirement benefit plans. At September 29, 2006, the Company had outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees in the amount of $1.3 billion. At September 29, 2006, TIGSA had unsecured credit facilities of $1.5 billion due December 21, 2007, and $1.0 billion due December 16, 2009, of which $1.8 billion was undrawn and available (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, certain of the Companys operating subsidiaries have uncommitted overdraft and similar types of facilities, which total $624 million, of which $606 million was undrawn and available at September 29, 2006. These facilities expire at various 61 dates through the year 2013, most of which are renewable and are established primarily within our international operations. At September 29, 2006, the Company had a contingent purchase price liability of $80 million related to the 2001 acquisition of Com Net by Electronics. This represents the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of Com Net only after the construction and installation of a communications system for the State of Florida is finished and the State has approved the system based on the guidelines set forth in the contract. A liability for this contingency has not been recorded in Tycos Consolidated Financial Statements as the outcome of this contingency cannot be reasonably determined. In June 2004, TIGSA entered into a $500 million 3 year unsecured letter of credit facility due June 15, 2007. The facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit, supported by a related line of credit facility. TIGSA may only borrow under the line of credit agreement to reimburse the bank for obligations with respect to letters of credit issued under this facility. The covenants under this facility are substantially similar to TIGSAs bank credit facilities entered into during December 2003 and the indenture related to TIGSAs 6% notes due 2013 issued in November 2003. TIGSA would pay interest on any outstanding borrowings at a variable interest rate, based on the banks base rate or the Eurodollar rate, as defined. Upon the occurrence of certain credit events, the interest rate on the outstanding borrowings becomes fixed. The issuance of letters of credit under this credit facility during 2004 enabled the Company to release approximately $480 million of restricted cash and investments. As of September 29, 2006, letters of credit of $475 million have been issued under the $500 million credit facility and $25 million remains available for issuance. There were no amounts borrowed under this credit facility at September 29, 2006. In the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Legal Matters Class Actions For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos securities class actions, shareholder derivative litigation, ERISA litigation and investigation, and litigation against former senior management, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings. We are generally obligated to indemnify our directors and officers and our former directors and officers who are named as defendants in some or all of these matters to the extent required by Bermuda law. In addition, our insurance carriers may decline coverage, or our coverage may be insufficient to cover our expenses and liability, in some or all of these matters. While we may from time to time seek to engage plaintiffs counsel in settlement discussions, we are unable at this time to estimate what our ultimate liability in these matters may be, and it is possible that we will be required to pay judgments or settlements and incur expenses, in excess of any insurance coverage, in aggregate amounts that would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or probable losses, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters. Investigations For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to governmental investigations related to Tyco see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Subpoenas and Document Requests From Governmental Entities. We cannot predict when these investigations will be completed, nor can we predict what the results of these investigations may be. It is possible that we will be required to pay material fines, consent to injunctions on future conduct, lose the ability to conduct business with government instrumentalities 62 (which in turn could negatively impact our business with non governmental customers) or suffer other penalties, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. It is not possible to estimate the amount of loss, or range of possible loss, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters. On April 17, 2006, the Company reached a settlement that closes the SEC Enforcement Divisions investigation of the Company regarding certain accounting practices and other actions by former Tyco officers. On April 25, 2006, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in which the Company was ordered to pay $1 in disgorgement and a fine of $50 million. During the third quarter of 2006, the Company satisfied the judgment which was accrued in 2005. Intellectual Property and Antitrust Litigation The Company is party to a number of patent infringement and antitrust actions that may require the Company to pay damage awards. Tyco has assessed the status of these matters and has recorded liabilities related to certain of these matters where appropriate. For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos intellectual property and antitrust litigation, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Intellectual Property and Antitrust Litigation. Environmental Matters For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos environmental matters, see Item 1. Business Environmental Matters. Asbestos Matters Tyco and some of its subsidiaries are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials. Consistent with the national trend of increased asbestos related litigation, the Company has observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits in the past several years. The majority of these cases have been filed against subsidiaries in Healthcare and Engineered Products and Services. A limited number of the cases allege premises liability, based on claims that individuals were exposed to asbestos while on a subsidiarys property. A majority of the cases involve product liability claims, based principally on allegations of past distribution of heat resistant industrial products incorporating asbestos or the past distribution of industrial valves that incorporated asbestos containing gaskets or packing. Each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants. Tycos involvement in asbestos cases has been limited because its subsidiaries did not mine or produce asbestos. Furthermore, in the Companys experience, a large percentage of these claims were never substantiated and have been dismissed by the courts. The Company will continue to vigorously defend these lawsuits and the Company has not suffered an adverse verdict in a trial court proceeding related to asbestos claims. When appropriate, the Company settles claims; however, the total amount paid in any year to settle and defend all asbestos claims has been immaterial. As of September 29, 2006, there were approximately 15,500 asbestos liability cases pending against the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company estimates its pending asbestos claims that were incurred but not reported, as well as related insurance and indemnification recoveries. The Companys estimate of the liability for pending and future claims is based on claim experience over the past five years and covers claims expected to be filed over the next seven years. The Company believes that it has adequate amounts recorded related to these matters. While it is not possible at this time to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome of these asbestos related proceedings, the Company believes that the final outcome of all 63 known and anticipated future claims, after taking into account its substantial indemnification rights and insurance coverage, will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Income Taxes Tyco and its subsidiaries income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. In connection with such examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. The Company is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies that management has assessed as probable and estimable have been recorded. While the timing and ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain, the Company anticipates that certain of these matters could be resolved during 2007. Compliance Matters Tyco has received and responded to various allegations that certain improper payments were made by Tyco subsidiaries in recent years. During 2005, Tyco reported to the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the SEC the investigative steps and remedial measures that it has taken in response to the allegations. Tyco also informed the DOJ and the SEC that it has retained outside counsel to perform a company wide baseline review of its policies, controls and practices with respect to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, that it would continue to make periodic progress reports to these agencies, and that it would present its factual findings upon conclusion of the baseline review. The Company has and will continue to have communications with the DOJ and SEC to provide updates on the baseline review being conducted by outside counsel, including, as appropriate, briefings concerning additional instances of potential improper payments identified by the Company in the course of its ongoing compliance activities. At this time, Tyco cannot predict the outcome of these matters reported to regulatory and law enforcement authorities and therefore cannot estimate the range of potential loss or extent of risk, if any, that may result from an adverse resolution of any or all of these matters. Other Matters The Company is a party to a contract dispute arising from Earth Techs contract with the City of Phoenix, Arizona for the expansion of the Citys 91st Avenue Waste Water Treatment Plant. Both Earth Tech and the City of Phoenix have filed lawsuits in the local county superior court alleging the other party has breached the contract. At this time, Tyco cannot predict the outcome of this matter and therefore cannot estimate the range of potential loss or extent of risk, if any, that may result from an adverse resolution of this matter. For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos other legal matters, see Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company is a defendant in a number of other pending legal proceedings incidental to present and former operations, acquisitions and dispositions. The Company does not expect the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Backlog At September 29, 2006, we had a backlog of unfilled orders of $14.2 billion, compared to a backlog of $13.5 billion at September 30, 2005. We expect that approximately 77% of our backlog at 64 September 29, 2006 will be filled during 2007. Backlog by reportable industry segment at September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005 is as follows ($ in millions): 2006 2005 Fire and Security $ 7,000 $ 6,732 Engineered Products and Services 4,167 4,007 Electronics 2,711 2,496 Healthcare 280 272 $ 14,158 $ 13,507 Within Fire and Security, backlog increased primarily as a result of strong bookings in North America and Europe. Backlog for Fire and Security includes recurring revenue in force, which represents twelve months fees for monitoring and maintenance services under contract in the security business. The amount of recurring revenue in force at September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005 was $3.65 billion and $3.55 billion, respectively. Backlog within Engineered Products and Services increased primarily as a result of increased orders at Flow Control. Within Electronics, backlog increased as a result of increased bookings in most key end markets. Backlog in Healthcare represents unfilled orders, which, in the nature of the business, are normally shipped shortly after purchase orders are received. We do not view backlog in Healthcare to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale of Accounts Receivable Tyco utilized several programs under which it sold participating interests in accounts receivable to investors who, in turn, purchased and received ownership and security interests in those receivables. These transactions qualified as true sales. The sale proceeds were less than the face amount of accounts receivable sold, and the discount from the face amount was included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Such discount aggregated $18 million, or 3.1% of the weighted average balance of the receivables outstanding, during 2004. During 2004, the Company reduced outstanding balances under its accounts receivable programs by $929 million, of which $812 million related to its corporate accounts receivable programs which were terminated in 2005. No amounts were utilized under these programs at September 30, 2004, and through the date of termination. The remaining reduction of $117 million related to certain of the Companys international businesses selling fewer accounts receivable as a short term financing mechanism. The aggregate amount outstanding under the Companys remaining international accounts receivable programs was $75 million and $80 million at September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005, respectively. Guarantees Certain of the Companys business segments have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from 2007 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In disposing of assets or businesses, the Company often provides representations, warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental 65 contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. The Company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the Company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item I. Business Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. The Company had an off balance sheet leasing arrangement for five cable laying sea vessels. Upon expiration of this lease in October 2006, a subsidiary of the Company has the option to buy these vessels for approximately $280 million, or return the vessels to the lessor and, under a residual guarantee, pay any shortfall in sales proceeds to the lessor from a third party in an amount not to exceed $235 million. As of September 29, 2006, the Company expected this obligation to be $54 million, which is recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, based on an estimate of the fair value of the vessels performed by management with the assistance of a third party valuation. In October 2006, the Company exercised its option to buy these vessels for $280 million. See Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company records estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. For further information on estimated product warranty, see Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2001, Engineered Products and Services initiated a Voluntary Replacement Program ("VRP") associated with the acquisition of Central Sprinkler. The VRP relates to the replacement of certain Model GB fire sprinkler heads which were originally manufactured by Central Sprinkler prior to Tycos acquisition. Under this program, the sprinkler heads are being replaced over a 5 7 year period free of charge to property owners. In the third quarter of 2006, the Company completed a comprehensive review of reported claims, recent claim rates and cost trends and further assessed the future of the program. The Company determined that an additional liability was necessary in order to satisfy the Companys obligation under the VRP. As a result, the Company recorded a $100 million charge which was reflected in cost of sales. Settlements during 2006 include cash expenditures of $37 million related to the VRP. 66   Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Effective October 1, 2005, Tyco adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123R, "Share Based Payment," which requires compensation costs related to share based transactions, including employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on fair value. SFAS No. 123R revises SFAS No. 123, as amended, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," and supersedes Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." Tyco adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective application transition method. Under this method, compensation cost is recognized for the unvested portion of share based payments granted prior to October 1, 2005 and all share based payments granted subsequent to September 30, 2005 over the related vesting period. Prior to October 1, 2005, the Company applied the intrinsic value based method prescribed in APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting for employee stock based compensation. Prior period results have not been restated. Due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Companys results from continuing operations for 2006 include incremental share based compensation expense totaling $161 million. As such, basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were impacted by $0.06 and $0.05, respectively, in 2006. On November 10, 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 123R 3, "Transition Election Related to Accounting for Tax Effects of Share Based Payment Awards." The Company elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in the FASB Staff Position for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to SFAS No. 123R in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool ("APIC pool") related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC pool and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of the tax effects of employee stock based compensation awards that are fully vested and outstanding upon adoption of SFAS No. 123R. The adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. The Company adopted FASB Interpretation ("FIN") No. 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143," during the fourth quarter of 2006. This Interpretation clarifies the timing of liability recognition for legal obligations associated with an asset retirement when the timing and (or) method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN No. 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. The Interpretation requires that conditional asset retirement obligations, along with the associated capitalized asset retirement costs, be reported at their fair values. Upon adoption, the Company recognized a liability of $32 million for asset retirement obligations and an increase of $10 million in the carrying amount of the related assets. The initial recognition resulted in a cumulative effect of accounting change of $22 million, pre tax, reflecting the accumulated depreciation and accretion that would have been recognized in prior periods had the provisions of FIN No. 47 been in effect at the time. Certain obligations relating to the handling and disposal of asbestos have not been recorded due to the fact that fair value cannot be reasonably estimated because the Company does not have sufficient information about the range of time over which the obligation may be settled. The undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset retirement obligations that have not been recognized in the financial statements are approximately $8 million. The Company will continue to monitor such legal asset retirement obligations and recognize a liability in the period sufficient information becomes available to reasonably estimate the fair value. In June 2005, the FASB issued Staff Position ("FSP") No. 143 1, "Accounting for Electronic Equipment Waste Obligations," which provides guidance on accounting for historical waste obligations associated with the European Union Waste, Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive ("WEEE Directive"). Under the directive, the waste management obligation for historical equipment (products 67 put on the market on or prior to August 13, 2005) remains with the commercial user until the equipment is replaced, at which time the waste management obligation may be transferred to the producer of the replacement equipment. FSP No. 143 1 is effective for the first reporting period ending after June 8, 2005 or the date of the adoption of the WEEE Directive into law by the applicable European Union member country. The financial statement impact depends heavily on the respective laws and regulations adopted by the EU member countries, their implementation guidance and the type of recycling programs and systems that are established. The Company evaluated the effects of FSP No. 143 1 and determined that it did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)." SFAS No. 158 requires that employers recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as a net asset or liability on the balance sheet and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. Under SFAS No. 158, companies are required to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of their fiscal year end. The Company presently uses a measurement date of August 31st. SFAS No. 158 also requires additional disclosure in the notes to the financial statements. The recognition provisions of SFAS No. 158 are effective for fiscal 2007, while the measurement date provisions become effective in fiscal 2009. The Company is currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 158 on its consolidated financial statements. Based on the funded status of defined benefit and other postretirement plans as of September 29, 2006, the Company estimates that it would recognize a net $356 million liability through a reduction in shareholders equity. The ultimate amounts recorded are highly dependent on various estimates and assumptions including, among other things, the discount rate selected, future compensation levels and performance of plan assets. Changes in these assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated impact of implementing SFAS No. 158. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements," which enhances existing guidance for measuring assets and liabilities at fair value. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for Tyco beginning September 29, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, that SFAS No. 157 will have on the results of its operations, financial position or cash flows. In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 108, "Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statement." SAB No. 108 requires that companies utilize a "dual approach" to assessing the quantitative effects of financial statement misstatements. The dual approach includes both an income statement focused and balance sheet focused assessment. SAB No. 108 is applicable for Tycos fiscal year ending September 28, 2007. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of SAB No. 108, but does not expect that it will have a significant impact on its financial position or results of operations. In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109." This Interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. FIN No. 48 is effective for Tyco in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The Company is currently assessing the impact that FIN No. 48 will have on the results of its operations, financial position or cash flows. 68  Forward Looking Information Certain statements in this report are "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. All statements contained herein that are not clearly historical in nature are forward looking, and the words "anticipate," "believe," "expect," "estimate," "project" and similar expressions are generally intended to identify forward looking statements. Any forward looking statement contained herein, in press releases, written statements or other documents filed with the SEC, or in Tycos communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, web casts, phone calls and conference calls, regarding expectations with respect to sales, earnings, cash flows, operating efficiencies, product expansion, backlog, the consummation and benefits of acquisitions and divestitures, the Proposed Separation or other matters, as well as financings and repurchases of debt or equity securities, are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and contingencies. Many of these risks, uncertainties and contingencies are beyond our control, and may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from anticipated results, performance or achievements. Factors that might affect such forward looking statements include, among other things: overall economic and business conditions; the demand for Tycos goods and services; competitive factors in the industries in which Tyco competes; changes in tax requirements (including tax rate changes, new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations); results and consequences of Tycos internal investigation and governmental investigations concerning the Companys governance, management, internal controls and operations; the outcome of litigation and governmental proceedings as a result of actions taken by our former senior corporate management; effect of income tax audit settlements; the ratings on our debt and our ability to repay or refinance our outstanding indebtedness as it matures; our ability to operate within the limitations imposed by financing arrangements and to maintain our credit ratings; interest rate fluctuations and other changes in borrowing costs; other capital market conditions, including foreign currency rate fluctuations; availability of and fluctuations in the prices of key raw materials, including steel; economic and political conditions in international markets, including governmental changes and restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders; the ability to achieve cost savings in connection with the Companys strategic restructuring and Six Sigma initiatives; potential further impairment of our goodwill and or our long lived assets; the impact of fluctuations in the price of Tyco common shares; changes in U.S. and non U.S. government regulations in general, and in particular changes in rules and regulations regarding the safety, efficacy, sales, promotions, insurance reimbursement and pricing of Tycos disposable medical products and other specialty products, as well as 69 changes in rules and regulations regarding the retirement and disposal of certain electrical products; the possible effects on Tyco of future legislation in the U.S. that may limit or eliminate potential U.S. tax benefits resulting from Tycos incorporation in Bermuda or deny U.S. government contracts to Tyco based upon its incorporation in Bermuda; and the potential distraction costs associated with negative publicity relating to actions of our former senior corporate management. Additionally, there are several factors and assumptions that could affect the Companys plan to separate into three independent entities, our future results and cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward looking statements: increased demands on the Companys management team as a result of the Proposed Separation; changes in business, political and economic conditions in the U.S. and in other countries in which the Company currently does business; changes in governmental regulations and policies and actions of regulatory bodies; changes in operating performance; required changes to existing financings, and changes in credit ratings, including those that may result from the Proposed Separation; the Companys ability to obtain the financing necessary to consummate the Proposed Separation; and the Companys ability to satisfy certain conditions precedent, including final approval by the Tyco Board of Directors, receipt of certain tax rulings, necessary opinions of counsel and the filing and effectiveness of registration statements with the SEC. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are subject to market risk associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. In order to manage the volatility relating to our more significant market risks, we enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts, cross currency swaps, foreign currency options, and interest rate swaps. We do not anticipate any material changes in our primary market risk exposures in 2007. In assessing the current and future risk related to movements in interest rates, we terminated the interest rate and cross currency swaps in several tranches. The aggregate notional value of the interest rate and cross currency swaps terminated during the fourth quarter of 2006 was $2.5 billion. In October 2006, we terminated the remaining contracts with a total notional amount of $0.6 billion. The settlement of these swaps resulted in a net cash inflow of $55 million. Since the interest rate swaps were designated as hedging instruments of outstanding debt, the related $32 million loss adjustment to the carrying value of the related debt will be amortized over the remaining life of the related debt instruments. In December 2006, due to required changes to the legal entity structure to facilitate the Proposed Separation, the Company determined that it will no longer consider certain intercompany foreign currency transactions to be long term investments. As a result, the related foreign currency transaction gains and losses on such investments will be recorded in the income statement rather than to the currency translation component of shareholders equity. Forward contracts that were previously designated as hedges of these net investments will continue to be used to manage this exposure but will no longer be designated as net investment hedges. 70 We utilize established risk management policies and procedures in executing derivative financial instrument transactions. We do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Derivative financial instruments related to interest rate sensitivity of debt obligations, intercompany cross border transactions and anticipated non functional currency cash flows, are used with the goal of mitigating a significant portion of these exposures when it is cost effective to do so. Counterparties to derivative financial instruments are limited to financial institutions with at least an A/A2 long term debt rating. Interest Rate Sensitivity The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, including debt obligations and interest rate swaps. For debt obligations, the table presents cash flows of principal repayment and weighted average interest rates. For interest rate and cross currency swaps, the table presents notional amounts at the current market price rate and weighted average interest rates. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract.
