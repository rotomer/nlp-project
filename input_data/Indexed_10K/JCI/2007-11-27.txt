On December 9, 2004, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend on our common shares from $0.05 to $0.40 per share. As a result, in 2005, Tyco paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per common share in the first quarter of 2005 and $0.40 per common share thereafter. Prior to 2005, Tyco paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per common share for all periods presented. (8)The decrease in total assets, long term debt and shareholders equity in 2007 is primarily related to the spin offs of Covidien and Tyco Electronics. 48 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the Selected Financial Data and our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those under the headings "Risk Factors" and "Forward Looking Information." Introduction The Consolidated Financial Statements include the consolidated results of Tyco International Ltd., a company organized under the laws of Bermuda, and its subsidiaries (hereinafter collectively referred to as "we," the "Company" or "Tyco") and have been prepared in United States dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). In connection with the Separation, Tyco Healthcare changed its name to Covidien Ltd. ("Covidien"). As Covidien and Tyco Electronics historically accounted for 55% of our revenues, we have realigned our management and segment reporting structure and report financial and operating information in the following five segments, effective March 31, 2007: ADT Worldwide designs, sells, installs, services and monitors electronic security systems to residential, commercial, industrial and governmental customers. Fire Protection Services designs, sells, installs and services fire detection and fire suppression systems to commercial, industrial and governmental customers. Flow Control designs, manufactures, sells and services valves, pipes, fittings, valve automation and heat tracing products for the water and wastewater markets, the oil, gas and other energy markets along with general process industries. Safety Products designs, manufactures and sells fire protection, security and life safety products, including fire suppression products, breathing apparatus, intrusion security, access control and video management systems. In addition, Safety Products manufactures products installed and serviced by ADT Worldwide and Fire Protection Services. Electrical and Metal Products designs, manufactures and sells steel tubing and pipe products, as well as cable products, including pre wired armored cable and flexible conduit products for commercial construction. We also provide general corporate services to our segments and these costs are reported as Corporate and Other. During the fourth quarter of 2007, Infrastructure Services, previously reported as part of Corporate and Other, met the held for sale criteria and has been included in discontinued operations in all periods presented. References to the segment data are to the Companys continuing operations. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to exclude the results of discontinued operations. Overview Effective June 29, 2007, Tyco completed the spin offs of Covidien and Tyco Electronics, formerly Healthcare and Electronics businesses, respectively, into separate, publicly traded companies (the "Separation") in the form of a distribution to Tyco shareholders. The distribution was made on June 29, 2007, to Tyco shareholders of record on June 18, 2007, the record date. Each Tyco shareholder received 0.25 of a common share of each of Covidien and Tyco Electronics for each Tyco common 49 share held on the record date. Tyco shareholders received cash in lieu of fractional shares for amounts of less than one Covidien or Tyco Electronics common share. The distribution was structured to be tax free to Tyco shareholders except to the extent of cash received in lieu of fractional shares. As a result of the distribution, the operations of Tycos former Healthcare and Electronics businesses are now classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented. Additionally, on the distribution date, the Company, as approved by its Board of Directors, effected a reverse stock split of Tycos common shares, at a split ratio of one for four. Shareholder approval for the reverse stock split was obtained at the March 8, 2007 Special General Meeting of Shareholders. Share and per share data for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split. We have and will continue to incur separation costs related to debt refinancing, tax restructuring, professional services and employee related costs. We currently estimate that the total income statement charges will be approximately $1.4 billion, after tax, much of which will be reflected as discontinued operations. During 2007 and 2006, the Company incurred pre tax costs related to the Separation, including the $647 million loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2007, of $1,083 million and $169 million, respectively. Of this amount, $105 million and $49 million is included in separation costs, $259 million and $0 million related to loss on early extinguishment of debt is included in other expense, net and $719 million and $120 million is included in discontinued operations, respectively. Most of the remaining charges are expected to be incurred during the first six months of fiscal 2008. Additionally, 2007 includes tax charges related to the Separation primarily for the write off of deferred tax assets that will no longer be realizable of $183 million, of which $95 million is included in income taxes and $88 million is included in discontinued operations. On April 27, 2007, in connection with the Separation, Tyco and certain of its subsidiaries that are issuers of its corporate debt commenced tender offers to purchase for cash substantially all of its outstanding U.S. dollar denominated public debt. Additionally, on April 30, 2007, Tyco International Group S.A., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("TIGSA"), commenced tender offers to purchase for cash all of its outstanding Euro and Pound Sterling denominated public debt. In connection with the debt tender offers, Tyco incurred a pre tax charge for the early extinguishment of debt of approximately $647 million, for which no tax benefit is available. In connection with the Separation, during the third quarter of 2007 we reorganized to a new management and segment reporting structure. As part of these organizational changes, we assessed new reporting units, assigned goodwill to the new reporting units and tested goodwill for impairment. As a result, we recognized a goodwill impairment of $46 million in 2007 in the ADT Worldwide segment. We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. In September 2007, Tycos Board of Directors approved a new $1.0 billion share repurchase program under which, we repurchased 1.3 million of our common shares for $56 million. During 2007 we also completed the $2.0 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in May 2006. Additionally, during 2006 we completed the $1.5 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in July of 2005. During 2007, we paid dividends of $791 million to shareholders. On September 13, 2007 Tycos Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend on the Companys common shares of $0.15 per share payable on November 1, 2007 to shareholders of record of Tyco International Ltd. post Separation on October 1, 2007. During 2007, we sold Aquas Industriales de Jose, C.A. ("AIJ"), a joint venture that was majority owned by Infrastructure Services, for $42 million in net cash proceeds and a pre tax gain of $19 million was recorded. AIJ met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and has been included in discontinued operations in all periods presented. 50 We are continuing to assess the strategic fit of our various businesses and are considering additional divestitures where businesses do not align with our long term vision. Tyco will explore a number of strategic alternatives for under performing or non strategic businesses including possible divestiture. In July 2007, the Board of Directors approved for divestiture Infrastructure Services which was previously reported as part of Corporate and Other. Infrastructure Services had total net revenue of $1.3 billion and operating income of $53 million in 2007. Infrastructure Services met the held for sale criteria in the fourth quarter of 2007 and has been included in discontinued operations in all periods presented. To further improve operating efficiency, during the first quarter of 2007, we launched a restructuring program across all segments, including the corporate organization, which will streamline some of the businesses and reduce the operational footprint. We expect to incur charges related to the program of approximately $350 million to $400 million through the end of 2008. During 2007, we incurred charges of $204 million, of which $7 million was recorded in cost of sales, and utilized cash of $70 million related to this program. We believe this restructuring program will strengthen our competitive position over the long term. Class Action Settlement On May 14, 2007, Tyco entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with plaintiffs counsel in connection with the settlement of 32 purported securities class action lawsuits. Under the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding, the plaintiffs agreed to release all claims against Tyco, the other settling defendants and ten other individuals in consideration for the payment of $2.975 billion from Tyco to the certified class. The parties to the Memorandum of Understanding have applied to the court for approval of the settlement agreement. On July 13, 2007, the U. S. District Court in Concord, New Hampshire granted preliminary approval of the settlement. On November 2, 2007, the final fairness hearing for the class settlement was held. The Court indicated it would approve the settlement and stated a formal ruling would be issued in a few weeks. If the settlement agreement does not receive final court approval, the Memorandum of Understanding will be null and void. By December 28, 2007, class participants must file their proofs of claim demonstrating their right to recovery under the class settlement. The deadline for deciding not to participate in the class settlement was September 28, 2007. As of such date, Tyco had received opt out notices from individuals and entities totaling approximately 4% of the shares owned by class members. These individuals and entities may pursue their claims separately against Tyco and any judgments resulting from such claims would not reduce the settlement amount. One entity, Franklin Mutual Advisers, LLC, has filed a complaint against Tyco on September 24, 2007 in an action styled Franklin Mutual Advisers, LLC v. Tyco International Ltd. in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging violations of Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 77(b), Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 78(b), and Rule 10b 5 promulgated thereunder and Section 18 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 78(k) in connection with the plaintiffs purchases and sales of Tyco securities between June 4, 2001 and April 30, 2002. The plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory damages and reasonable attorneys fees and costs. Tyco has requested that this action be transferred to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. Tyco intends to vigorously defend the litigation. It is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome or to estimate the amount of loss or range of possible loss, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of the Franklin matter or other unasserted claims from individuals that have opted out. 51  Under the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement entered into in connection with the Separation, each of Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics are jointly and severally liable for the full amount of the class action settlement and any judgments resulting from opt out claims. Additionally, under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the companies share in the liability and related escrow accounts, with Tyco assuming 27%, Covidien 42% and Tyco Electronics 31% of the settlement amount. Tyco incurred a charge to expense, for which no tax benefit is available, and a current liability of $2.975 billion in 2007. The Company has also recovered or expects to recover certain of these costs from insurers. As such, the Company recorded $113 million of recoveries in connection with the class action settlement in its Consolidated Statements of Operations. Tyco borrowed under its unsecured bridge and credit facilities to fund the liability and placed the proceeds in escrow for the benefit of the class. In connection with the Separation, Covidien and Tyco Electronics assumed their portion of the related borrowing. The escrow accounts will earn interest that is payable to the class. Interest is also accrued on the class action settlement liability. Based on the Separation and Distribution Agreement, at September 28, 2007 Tyco had a receivable from Covidien and Tyco Electronics for their portion of the liability of $1,257 million and $927 million, respectively, and a payable to Covidien and Tyco Electronics for their interest in the escrow accounts. Receivables and payables that pertain to the class action settlement and related escrow accounts with the same counterparty are presented net in the consolidated balance sheet. Tycos portion of the liability is $808 million. Additionally, Tyco has paid $73 million and recorded payables of $9 million at September 28, 2007, with an offset to shareholders equity for amounts due to Covidien and Tyco Electronics for their portion of the insurance recovery. Operating Results Net revenue and net income for the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005 were as follows ($ in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Revenue from product sales $ 12,095 $ 10,974 $ 10,342 Service revenue 6,686 6,362 6,323 Net revenue $ 18,781 $ 17,336 $ 16,665 Operating (loss) income $ (1,715 ) $ 1,370 $ 1,191 Interest income 102 43 39 Interest expense (313 ) (279 ) (322 ) Other expense, net (255 ) (296 ) (Loss) income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest (2,181 ) 1,134 612 Income taxes (334 ) (310 ) (29 ) Minority interest (4 ) (1 ) (2 ) (Loss) income from continuing operations (2,519 ) 823 581 Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes 777 2,781 2,492 (Loss) income before cumulative effect of accounting change (1,742 ) 3,604 3,073 Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of income taxes (14 ) 21 Net (loss) income $ (1,742 ) $ 3,590 $ 3,094 Net revenue increased $1.4 billion, or 8.3%, for 2007 as compared to 2006 as a result of growth in all of our segments. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by Flow Control as a result of volume growth from continued strength in most industrial end markets. In addition, ADT Worldwide had strong growth in Asia and Latin America, as well as growth in its recurring revenue base and 52 contracting revenue in North America. Fire Protection Services experienced continued growth in electronic and mechanical contracting. Foreign currency exchange rates positively affected 2007 by $586 million while the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures negatively affected 2007 by $48 million. Operating income decreased $3.1 billion for 2007. Operating income was primarily impacted by the class action settlement charge, net of $2.862 billion. Revenue growth in all segments was partially offset by lower margins in Electrical and Metal Products primarily due to unfavorable spreads on both steel and copper products. Additionally, operating income was impacted by costs incurred relating to the Separation and the restructuring program announced in November 2006. Separation related costs impacted operating income by $105 million for 2007 and $49 million for 2006. Restructuring and asset impairment charges, net impacted operating income by $217 million for 2007. Also impacting operating income was a goodwill impairment charge of $46 million due to the reorganization into our new management and segment reporting structure. Divestiture charges impacted 2007 by $4 million. Restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net were $15 million for 2006. Net revenue increased $671 million, or 4.0%, for 2006 as compared to 2005 as a result of growth in four of our segments. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by Flow Control as a result of volume growth from strength in most industrial end markets. In addition, revenue growth was favorably impacted by increased selling prices of armored cable products due to higher costs of copper within Electrical and Metal Products during 2006. Foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected 2006 by $85 million while the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures negatively affected the period by $118 million. Operating income increased $179 million, or 15.0%, for 2006 while operating margin increased 0.8 percentage points to 7.9%. The increase in operating income was driven by growth in three of our segments as well as reduced operating expenses in corporate, partially offset by lower margins in ADT Worldwide and Safety Products. Operating income for 2006 was unfavorably affected by a $100 million charge relating to a pre existing voluntary replacement program for certain sprinkler heads, incremental stock option charges of $84 million as required under SFAS No. 123R, "Share Based Payments," Separation related costs of $49 million and net restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges of $15 million. Operating income for 2006 also included $72 million of income related to the extinguishment of certain payment obligations under a split dollar life insurance policy and rabbi trust pursuant to a settlement with Mr. Kozlowski, former Chief Executive Officer, and $48 million of income resulting from a reduction in our estimated workers compensation liabilities primarily due to favorable claims experience. Operating income during 2005 was negatively affected by net restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges of $40 million. In addition, 2005 was unfavorably affected by a charge of $50 million related to an SEC enforcement action and a $70 million charge for estimated contingencies related to contested legal proceedings seeking to enforce retention agreements for five former executives. 53 Results by Geographic Area Net revenue by geographic area for the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005 was as follows ($ in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Net revenue(1): United States $ 8,884 $ 8,613 $ 8,161 Other Americas 1,445 1,358 1,255 Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") 5,462 4,825 4,876 Asia Pacific 2,990 2,540 2,373 $ 18,781 $ 17,336 $ 16,665 (1)Revenue is attributed to individual countries based on the reporting entity that records the transaction. Segment Results The segment discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in results for each of our realigned segments included in continuing operations. ADT Worldwide Net revenue, operating income and operating margin for ADT Worldwide for the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005 were as follows ($ in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Revenue from product sales $ 2,734 $ 2,546 $ 2,471 Service revenue 4,914 4,659 4,633 Net revenue $ 7,648 $ 7,205 $ 7,104 Operating income $ 842 $ 907 $ 952 Operating margin 11.0 % 12.6 % 13.4 % Net revenue by geographic area for ADT Worldwide for the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005 was as follows ($ in millions): 2007 2006 2005 North America $ 4,093 $ 3,980 $ 3,930 Europe, Middle East and Africa 2,574 2,368 2,399 Rest of World 981 857 775 $ 7,648 $ 7,205 $ 7,104 Net revenue for ADT Worldwide increased 6.1% during 2007, with product revenue up 7.4% and service revenue up 5.5%, as compared to 2006. Revenue from product sales includes sales and installation of electronic security and other systems. Service revenue is comprised of electronic security services and maintenance, including the monitoring of burglar alarms, fire alarms and other life safety systems as well as services related to retailer anti theft systems. The 2.8% revenue growth in North America resulted largely from an increase in commercial installations, primarily in the retailer market, as well as an increase in the recurring revenue base. Revenue in the EMEA region grew 8.7%, primarily driven by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The 14.5% revenue growth in the Rest of World geographies was primarily driven by strong growth in Asia and Latin America and, to a lesser extent, favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Overall, net revenue was 54 favorably affected by $213 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates while the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures unfavorably impacted net revenue by $3 million. North America is the most profitable geographic area for ADT Worldwide with 2007 and 2006 operating margin of 17.1% and 16.6%, respectively. ADT EMEA, while profitable with 2007 and 2006 operating margin of 3.1% and 6.3%, respectively, has strong future prospects but is not performing to the level we believe is attainable. As part of our long term program to improve profitability in ADT EMEA, several specific actions have been started, including the appointment of new general management and initiation of an estimated $90 million restructuring program to improve field efficiency, operations and consolidate certain administrative functions. We incurred charges of $69 million related to this restructuring program in 2007 which negatively impacted operating margins. Attrition rates for customers in our ADT Worldwide business continued to improve, declining to an average of 12.3% on a trailing 12 month basis for 2007, as compared to 14.2% for 2006 and 15.0% in 2005. As a result of our ongoing review of attrition rates and other pertinent factors affecting the related patterns in which revenues are expected to be earned, management reassessed amortization and depreciation methods and lives for its company owned security systems and dealer intangible assets and made adjustments in 2007 (see Note 1). Operating income of $842 million in 2007 decreased $65 million from $907 million in 2006. Factors that positively impacted operating income included increased volume, operational efficiencies and reductions to depreciation and amortization expense, of $26 million. The decrease to depreciation and amortization expense resulted from changes to the depreciation method and estimated useful lives for pooled subscriber assets and changes to the estimated useful lives of dealer intangible assets. These increases were more than offset by a goodwill impairment charge of $46 million, due to the reorganization of our management and segment reporting structure, as well as increased investment in selling and marketing in Americas and Asia. In addition, results for 2007 included net restructuring and asset impairment charges of $83 million, which were primarily related to actions to improve field efficiencies and consolidating certain administrative functions in Europe, and an impairment of certain indefinite lived intangible assets. Net restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges were $5 million in 2006. During the fourth quarter of 2007, ADT Worldwide began converting certain North American customers to digital backup services in advance of the February 2008 analog to digital signal transition for wireless cellular carriers. Given the Companys experience with this conversion in the fourth quarter, we estimate that the cost of the conversion will negatively impact operating income by approximate $40 million to $50 million in the first half of 2008. Net revenue for ADT Worldwide increased 1.4% during 2006, with product revenue up 3.0% compared to 2005. Revenue grew 10.6% in the Rest of World geographies, driven primarily by strong growth in Asia and Latin America. Revenue in North America was up slightly, while revenue in the EMEA region declined due to the continued high attrition of the legacy account base in Continental Europe. Net revenue was unfavorably affected by $35 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates while the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures unfavorably impacted net revenue by $19 million. Operating income decreased $45 million in 2006 from 2005. Results for 2006 included net restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges of $5 million as compared to net restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges of $13 million in 2005. Operating income for 2006 was negatively affected by slightly lower gross margin, due largely to margin pressures in commercial contracting coupled with a slightly higher mix of lower margin contracting revenue. These effects were partially offset by cost savings related to operational excellence initiatives. In addition, 2006 was unfavorably affected by incremental stock option charges of $14 million required under SFAS No. 123R. 55 Fire Protection Services Net revenue, operating income and operating margin for Fire Protection Services for the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005 were as follows ($ in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Revenue from product sales $ 1,901 $ 1,729 $ 1,626 Service revenue 1,605 1,552 1,556 Net revenue $ 3,506 $ 3,281 $ 3,182 Operating income $ 253 $ 239 $ 202 Operating margin 7.2 % 7.3 % 6.3 % Net revenue for Fire Protection Services increased $225 million, or 6.9%, during 2007 as compared to 2006, driven largely by a 9.9% increase in revenue from product sales. Revenue from product sales includes sales and installation of fire protection and other systems. Service revenue comprises inspection, maintenance, service and monitoring of fire detection and suppression systems. This increase was largely the result of strong growth in most regions which benefited from continuing strength in commercial construction activity in our focused end markets. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact of $99 million while divestitures had a negative impact of $30 million. Operating income increased $14 million during 2007 as compared to 2006 resulting largely from increased volume, and improved margins, primarily in North America. Results for 2007 included net restructuring charges of $33 million, of which $1 million is included in cost of sales, primarily related to actions to improve field efficiencies and consolidate certain administrative functions in Europe, compared to no charges 2006. Net revenue for Fire Protection Services increased $99 million, or 3.1%, during 2006 as compared to 2005, driven largely by a 6.3% increase in revenue from product sales. Most of the revenue increase occurred in North America, which experienced strong bookings and increasing backlog throughout most of the past two years. Revenue was unfavorably affected by $39 million related to divestitures and $22 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Operating income increased $37 million in 2006 over 2005. Higher revenue, slightly improved gross margin and continued control of general and administrative expenses contributed to the improved operating results. Operating income for 2006 was also favorably affected by cost savings related to operational excellence initiatives and prior year restructuring programs. In addition, 2006 was unfavorably affected by incremental stock option charges of $8 million required under SFAS No. 123R. Flow Control Net revenue, operating income and operating margin for Flow Control for the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005 were as follows ($ in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Revenue from product sales $ 3,618 $ 3,002 $ 2,690 Service revenue 148 133 116 Net revenue $ 3,766 $ 3,135 $ 2,806 Operating income $ 457 $ 356 $ 336 Operating margin 12.1 % 11.4 % 12.0 % Net revenue for Flow Control increased $631 million, or 20.1%, in 2007 as compared 2006. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by volume growth from continued strength in most industrial 56 end markets with significant project growth in the energy and water sectors. Growth in these sectors was strong across all geographical regions, and, in particular, Asia Pacific and Europe. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted revenue by $197 million while the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures unfavorably impacted net revenue by $16 million. The increase in operating income of $101 million, or 28.4%, in 2007 as compared 2006 was primarily due to revenue growth, as well as improved utilization rates. The increase in operating income during 2007 was partially offset by net restructuring and asset impairment charges of $25 million, which includes $6 million in cost of sales, $3 million of divestiture charges, and $1 million of Separation costs. Net revenue for Flow Control increased $329 million, or 11.7%, in 2006 as compared to 2005. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by volume growth from strength in most industrial end markets with substantial project growth in the energy, process and water sectors. Growth in these sectors was particularly strong in Asia Pacific and the Americas. The increases in revenue were partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $43 million. The increase in operating income in 2006 as compared to 2005 was due primarily to revenue growth mentioned above, along with the impact of operational excellence initiatives. This increase was partially offset by the impact of incremental stock option charges required under SFAS No. 123R of $7 million. Safety Products Net revenue, operating income and operating margin for Safety Products for the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005 were as follows ($ in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Revenue from product sales $ 1,752 $ 1,660 $ 1,668 Service revenue 15 15 14 Net revenue $ 1,767 $ 1,675 $ 1,682 Operating income $ 286 $ 202 $ 278 Operating margin 16.2 % 12.1 % 16.5 % Net revenue for Safety Products increased $92 million, or 5.5%, during 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily from strong performance in the fire suppression and electronic security businesses. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $48 million also contributed to the increase in revenue. The increase in the fire suppression business was driven by continued growth in the energy and marine sectors in the Americas and the Middle East as well as increased selling prices to help offset the significant cost increase of raw materials. The electronic security business also experienced favorable growth as a result of new product introductions and new market expansions. These increases were partially offset by continued softness in the life safety business in North America due to delays of federal assistance provided to fire departments. Operating income increased $84 million to $286 million for the year ended September 28, 2007 compared to the prior year. Prior year results included a $100 million charge related to a pre existing Voluntary Replacement Program ("VRP") for sprinkler heads in the fire suppression business. The deadline for filing claims to participate in the VRP ended on August 31, 2007. In light of the most current claims data, an additional $10 million charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007. Net revenue for Safety Products decreased $7 million during 2006 as compared to 2005 driven by the unfavorable impact of $56 million from divested businesses as well as delays of federal assistance provided to fire departments which unfavorably impacted the life safety business. These decreases were 57 partially offset by stronger performance in the fire suppression business as a result of favorable market conditions in the United States, Middle East and China and new product introductions, including clean agent fire suppression systems. The electronic security business also experienced favorable growth as a result of new product introductions and new market expansions. Foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted revenues by $7 million. Operating income decreased $76 million in 2006 over 2005 primarily as a result of a $100 million charge related to a pre existing voluntary replacement program for sprinkler heads in the fire suppression business. This charge reflected our updated estimate of the additional costs necessary to bring the program to completion. The decrease in operating income during 2006 was partially offset by volume growth and higher margins from new product introductions and price increases in the fire suppression and electronic security business, as well as cost reduction benefits from the 2004 restructuring programs. Also, 2006 results include the effect of incremental stock option charges required under SFAS No. 123R of $5 million. Electrical and Metal Products Net revenue, operating income and operating margin for Electrical and Metal Products for the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005 were as follows ($ in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Revenue from product sales $ 1,970 $ 1,946 $ 1,795 Service revenue 4 3 3 Net revenue $ 1,974 $ 1,949 $ 1,798 Operating income $ 159 $ 319 $ 295 Operating margin 8.1 % 16.4 % 16.4 % Net revenue for Electrical and Metal Products increased $25 million, or 1.3%, in 2007 as compared to 2006. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $20 million contributed to the increase in revenue. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by increased sales volume of armored cable products, steel tubular products, and higher selling prices and sales volumes in Brazil. These increases were largely offset by the impact of lower selling prices on steel tubular products in North America. The decrease in operating income of $160 million, or 50.2%, in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to unfavorable spreads on both steel tubular and armored cable products. Income generated by higher sales volume for both armored cable and steel tubular products were more than offset by lower selling prices and higher raw material prices. Net revenue for Electrical and Metal Products increased $151 million, or 8.4%, in 2006 as compared to 2005. The increase in net revenue in 2006 was largely driven by increased selling prices of armored cable products as a result of higher costs of copper and higher volumes of core steel products due to growth in the non residential construction markets in North America. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $15 million also contributed to the increase in revenue. The above increases in revenue were partially offset by the impact of lower selling prices on core steel products in North America mainly due to lower costs of steel and a slower market for products in Brazil. The increase in operating income of $24 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 was due primarily to favorable copper spreads and higher volumes of core steel products. These increases were partially offset by the impact of reduced spreads for core steel products and incremental stock option charges required under SFAS No. 123R of $3 million. 58  Corporate and Other Net revenue, operating income and operating margin for Corporate and Other Metal Products for the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005 were as follows ($ in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Revenue from product sales $ 120 $ 91 $ 93 Service revenue Net revenue $ 120 $ 91 $ 93 Operations $ 24 $ 18 $ 18 Corporate expense (3,736 ) (671 ) (890 ) Operating loss $ (3,712 ) $ (653 ) $ (872 ) Corporate and Other includes the operating results of certain international buildings products businesses. Corporate expense for 2007 included class action settlement charge, net of $2.862 billion, Separation related costs of $104 million, and net restructuring charges of $40 million primarily related to the consolidation of certain headquarter functions. Additionally, corporate expense for 2007 includes $13 million of charges related to the accelerated amortization of restricted shares in connection with the Separation. In connection with the Separation, we have initiated actions to reduce our corporate expense and are targeting a full year corporate expense run rate of $500 million by mid 2008. Corporate expense in 2006 was $219 million lower than 2005. Corporate expense for 2006 included $72 million of income related to the extinguishment of certain payment obligations under a split dollar life insurance policy and rabbi trust pursuant to a settlement with Mr. Kozlowski, former Chief Executive Officer, and $48 million of income resulting from a reduction in our estimated workers compensation liabilities primarily due to favorable claims experience. These income items were partially offset by incremental stock option charges of $47 million required under SFAS 123R, Separation related costs of $49 million and restructuring and divestiture charges of $2 million. On a comparative basis to 2005, corporate expense in 2006 also benefited from lower Sarbanes Oxley compliance costs. Corporate expense for 2005 included a $50 million charge for fines and penalties paid to resolve the matters raised in the SEC investigation that commenced in June 2002, as well as a $70 million charge for estimated contingencies related to contested legal proceedings seeking to enforce retention agreements for five former executives. Interest Income and Expense Interest income was $102 million in 2007, as compared to $43 million and $39 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in interest income in 2007 is primarily related to interest earned on the class action settlement escrow of $41 million. Interest expense was $313 million in 2007, as compared to $279 million in 2006 and $322 million in 2005. The increase in interest expense in 2007 is a result of interest on the class action settlement liability of $41 million, partially offset by lower debt outstanding. The decrease in interest expense in 2006 is primarily driven by lower debt balances, partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates on our interest rate swap program as compared to 2005. The weighted average interest rate on total debt outstanding at September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005 were 6.3%, 6.0% and 5.7%, respectively. 59 In each period, net interest amounts were proportionally allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics based on the debt amounts that we believe were utilized by Covidien and Tyco Electronics historically inclusive of amounts directly incurred and is reflected as discontinued operations. Allocated net interest was calculated using our historical weighted average interest rate on debt, including the impact of interest rate swap agreements. The portion of Tycos interest income allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics was $35 million, $53 million and $43 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The portion of Tycos interest expense allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics was $242 million, $378 million and $433 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Other Expense, Net Other expense, net was $255 million in 2007 and $296 million in 2005. During 2007, other expense, net consisted primarily of a $259 million loss on early extinguishment of debt incurred in connection with the debt tender offers (see Note 13), for which no tax benefit is available. This charge consists primarily of premiums paid and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts. The total loss on early extinguishment of debt was $647 million, with $259 million included in continuing operations and $388 million allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics and included in discontinued operations. During 2005, other expense, net consisted primarily of losses related to the repurchase of outstanding convertible debt prior to its scheduled maturity partially offset by a $109 million court ordered restitution award. During 2005, the Company repurchased $1,241 million principal amount of its outstanding 2.75% convertible senior debentures for $1,823 million and $750 million principal amount of its outstanding 3.125% convertible senior debentures for $1,147 million. These repurchases resulted in a $1,013 million loss on the retirement of debt, including the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs, with $405 included in continuing operations and $608 million allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics and included in discontinued operations. Additionally, in September 2005, we were awarded a total of $134 million as restitution in connection with our litigation against Mr. L. Dennis Kozlowski, our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Mark H. Swartz, our former Chief Financial Officer and Director (together, the "Defendants"), as described in Item 3. Legal Proceedings. The restitution award is comprised of $109 million of previously expensed compensation made to the Defendants and reported as other expense, net in prior years and $25 million related to a loan receivable from Mr. L. Dennis Kozlowski which had been reflected in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements as a receivable. During 2007, the Company received payment for these amounts. Income Taxes Effective Income Tax Rate The effective tax rate for 2007 is not meaningful primarily as a result of the class action settlement charge, net of $2.862 billion and the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $259 million for which no tax benefit is available. Additionally, taxes for 2007 were negatively impacted by tax costs related to the Separation. Our effective income tax rate was 27.3% and 4.7% for 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate from 2005 to 2006 was primarily the result of a lower release of deferred tax asset valuation allowances, increased profits in higher tax rate jurisdictions and adjustments to the tax accrual for legacy tax matters in 2005, partially offset by the loss on retirement of debt for which no benefit was available in 2005. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $666 million and $800 million at September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of 60 certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," which requires a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is "more likely than not" that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by these taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as payment is not expected within one year. Other Income Tax Matters In connection with the spin offs of Covidien and Tyco Electronics from Tyco, Tyco entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that generally governs Covidiens, Tyco Electronics and Tycos respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations after the distribution with respect to taxes, including ordinary course of business taxes and taxes, if any, incurred as a result of any failure of the distribution of all of the shares of Covidien or Tyco Electronics to qualify as a tax free distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 355 of the Code or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin offs to qualify for tax favored treatment under the Code. Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, with certain exceptions, Tyco generally is responsible for the payment of 27% of any additional U.S. income taxes that are required to be paid to a U.S. tax authority as a result of a U.S. tax audit of Covidiens, Tyco Electronics or Tycos subsidiaries income tax returns for all periods prior to the spin offs. Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, the Company shares responsibility for certain of Tycos, Covidiens and Tyco Electronics income tax liabilities based on a sharing formula for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. More specifically, Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics share 27%, 42% and 31%, respectively, of U.S. income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to Tycos, Covidiens and Tyco Electronics U.S. income tax returns. All costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are shared equally among the parties. At September 28, 2007, Tyco has recorded a receivable from Covidien and Tyco Electronics of $103 million reflected in other assets as our estimate of their portion of the Tax Sharing obligations with an offset to shareholders equity. Other liabilities include $543 million for the fair value of Tycos obligations under the Tax Sharing Agreement, determined in accordance with FIN 45 recognized with an offset to shareholders equity. Tyco will provide payment under the Tax Sharing Agreement as the shared income tax liabilities are settled. Settlement is expected to occur as the IRS audit process is completed for the impacted years. Given the nature of the shared liabilities, the maximum amount of potential future payments is not determinable. In the event the Separation is determined to be taxable and such determination was the result of actions taken after the Separation by Tyco, Covidien or Tyco Electronics, the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on Tyco, Covidien or Tyco Electronics as a result 61 thereof. If such determination is not the result of actions taken after the Separation by Tyco, Covidien or Tyco Electronics, then Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics would be responsible for 27%, 42% and 31%, respectively, of any taxes imposed on Tyco, Covidien or Tyco Electronics as a result of such determination. Such tax amounts could be significant. The Company is responsible for all of its own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreements sharing formula. In addition, Covidien and Tyco Electronics are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the Tax Sharing Agreements sharing formula. If any party to the Tax Sharing Agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no partys fault, each non defaulting party would be required to pay, equally with any other non defaulting party, the amounts in default. In addition, if another party to the Tax Sharing Agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority, the Company could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, the Company may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of its agreed upon share of Tycos, Covidiens and Tyco Electronics tax liabilities. See Note 16 for further discussion of guarantees and indemnifications extended among Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics. The Company and its subsidiaries income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. The Company is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest that management has assessed as probable and estimable have been recorded. In 2004, in connection with the IRS audit of the 1997 through 2000 years, the Company submitted to the IRS proposed adjustments to these prior period U.S. federal income tax returns resulting in a reduction in the taxable income previously filed. During 2006, the IRS accepted substantially all of the proposed adjustments. Also during 2006, the Company developed proposed amendments to U.S. federal income tax returns for additional periods through 2002. On the basis of previously accepted amendments, the Company has determined that acceptance of these adjustments is probable and, accordingly, has recorded them in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such adjustments did not have a material impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The Company has yet to complete proposed amendments to its U.S. federal income tax returns for periods subsequent to 2002, which will primarily reflect the roll forward through 2006 of the amendments for the periods 1997 to 2002. When the Companys tax return positions are updated additional adjustments may be identified and recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. While the final adjustments cannot be determined until the income tax return amendment process is completed, the Company believes that any resulting adjustments will not have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. During the third quarter of 2007, the IRS concluded its field examination of certain of Tycos U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 though 2000 and issued anticipated Revenue Agents Reports ("RARs") which reflect the IRS determination of proposed tax adjustments for the periods under audit. The RARs propose tax audit adjustments to certain of the Companys previously filed tax return positions, all of which the Company expected and previously assessed at each balance sheet date. Accordingly, the Company has made no additional provision during the year ended September 28, 2007 as a result of the proposed audit adjustments in the RARs. The Company has agreed with the IRS on adjustments totaling $498 million, with an estimated cash impact to the Company of $458 million, and during the third quarter of 2007, the Company paid $458 million, of which $163 million relates to the Companys discontinued operations. The Company 62 appealed other proposed tax audit adjustments totaling approximately $1 billion, and, as Audit Managing Party as specified in the Tax Sharing Agreement, the Company intends to vigorously defend its prior filed tax return positions. The Company continues to believe that the amounts recorded in its financial statements relating to these tax adjustments are sufficient. However, the ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain and could result in a material impact to the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, ultimate resolution of these matters could result in the Company filing amended U.S. federal income tax returns for years subsequent to the current 1997 to 2000 audit period and could have a material impact on the Companys effective tax rate in future reporting periods. Additionally, the IRS proposed civil fraud penalties against a prior subsidiary that was distributed to Tyco Electronics arising from alleged actions of former executives in connection with certain intercompany transfers of stock of Simplex Technologies in 1998 and 1999. Based on statutory guidelines, we estimate the proposed penalties could range between $30 million and $50 million. The Company as Audit Managing Party will vigorously oppose the assertion of such penalties against Tyco Electronics, in part, because beginning in 2003 the Company discovered, investigated and reported the conduct at issue to the IRS and fully cooperated in the criminal prosecution of the Companys former Chief Tax Officer on a charge of willful filing of a false tax return. Except for earnings that are currently distributed, no additional material provision has been made for U.S. or non U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or the Company has concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of distribution of such earnings. A liability could arise if amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries. Discontinued Operations and Divestitures Discontinued Operations During the third quarter of 2007, Tyco completed the Separation and has presented its Healthcare and Electronics businesses as discontinued operations in all periods presented. The Company has used available information to develop its best estimates for certain assets and liabilities related to the Separation. In limited instances, final determination of the balances will be made in subsequent periods. During the fourth quarter of 2007, $72 million was recorded through shareholders equity, primarily related to the cash true up adjustment and other items, as specified in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, adjustments to certain pre Separation tax liabilities, and the impact of filing final income tax returns in certain jurisdictions where those returns include a combination of Tyco, Covidien and or Tyco Electronics legal entities. Additional adjustments are not expected to be material and will be recorded through shareholders equity in subsequent periods as tax returns are finalized. During 2007, AIJ, a joint venture that was majority owned by Infrastructure Services, was sold for $42 million in net cash proceeds and a pre tax gain on sale of $19 million was recorded. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2007, the remaining portion of Infrastructure Services met the held for sale criteria and its results of operations have been included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. Infrastructure Services provides consulting, engineering, construction management and operating services for the water, wastewater, environmental, transportation and facilities market. The Company has assessed the recoverability of these businesses carrying values and will continue to assess recoverability based on current fair value, less cost to sell, until the businesses are sold. On September 17, 2007, the Company executed a definitive agreement to sell for approximately 63 $295 million in cash 100% of the stock of ETEO Empresa de Transmissao de Energia do Oeste Ltda., a Brazilian subsidiary of Infrastructure Services. The transaction is subject to Brazilian regulatory approval and normal closing conditions and is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2008. The Company expects to sell the remaining portion of Infrastructure Services by the end of fiscal 2008. The AIJ, Infrastructure Services, Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products and A&E Products businesses met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and have been included in discontinued operations in all periods presented. Losses on divestitures During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company recorded $4 million, $2 million and $23 million, respectively, of divestiture charges in continuing operations in connection with the write down to fair value, less cost to sell, of certain businesses. The fair value used for the impairment assessments was primarily based on the terms and conditions included or expected to be included in the sales agreements. Acquisitions During 2007, cash paid for acquisitions included in continuing operations, primarily within ADT Worldwide, Safety Products and Flow Control, totaled $31 million. Cash paid for acquisitions by businesses included in continuing operations during 2006 and 2005 totaled $5 million and $6 million, respectively. These acquisitions were funded utilizing cash from operations. The results of operations of the acquired companies have been included in Tycos consolidated results from the respective acquisition dates. These acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Goodwill Impairment In connection with the Separation, during the third quarter of 2007 Tyco reorganized into a new management and segment reporting structure. As part of these organizational changes, the Company assessed new reporting units and conducted valuations to determine the assignment of goodwill to the new reporting units based on their estimated relative fair values. Following the relative fair value goodwill allocation, the Company then tested goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded its fair value, goodwill was considered potentially impaired. Where goodwill was potentially impaired, the Company compared the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill to the carrying amount of that goodwill. The carrying amount of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill in the Australia and New Zealand Security Services business, part of the ADT Worldwide segment. As a result, the Company recognized a goodwill impairment of $46 million in the third quarter of 2007. In determining fair value, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgments in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. Changes to these factors and judgments could result in impairment to one or more of our reporting units in a future period. See Note 1. 64  Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change During 2006, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation ("FIN") No. 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143." FIN No. 47 clarifies the timing of liability recognition for legal obligations associated with an asset retirement when the timing and (or) method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity and clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. FIN No. 47 requires that conditional asset retirement obligations, along with the associated capitalized asset retirement costs, be initially reported at their fair values. Upon adoption, the Company recognized a liability of $32 million for asset retirement obligations and an increase of $10 million in the carrying amount of the related assets, of which $19 million and $5 million are reflected in liabilities and assets of discontinued operations, respectively. The initial recognition resulted in a cumulative effect of accounting change of $14 million after tax loss ($22 million pre tax), reflecting the accumulated depreciation and accretion that would have been recognized in prior periods had the provisions of FIN No. 47 been in effect at the time. During 2005, the Company changed the measurement date for its pension and postretirement benefit plans, from September 30th to August 31st, effective October 1, 2004. The Company believes that the one month change of measurement date is a preferable change as it allows management adequate time to evaluate and report the actuarial information in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements under the accelerated reporting deadlines. As a result of this change, the Company recorded a $21 million after tax gain ($28 million pre tax) cumulative effect of accounting change. 65  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. Depreciation and Amortization Methods for Security Monitoring Related Assets Tyco generally considers assets related to the acquisition of new customers in its electronic security business in three asset categories: internally generated residential subscriber systems, internally generated commercial subscriber systems (collectively referred to as subscriber system assets) and customer accounts acquired through the ADT dealer program (referred to as dealer intangibles). Subscriber system assets include installed property, plant and equipment for which Tyco retains ownership and deferred costs directly related to the customer acquisition and system installation. Subscriber system assets and any deferred revenue resulting from the customer acquisition are accounted for over the expected life of the subscriber. In certain geographical areas where the Company has a large number of customers that behave in a similar manner over time, the Company accounts for subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue using pools, with separate pools for the components of subscriber system assets and any related deferred revenue based on the month and year of acquisition. Effective as of the beginning of the third quarter of 2007, Tyco changed the depreciation method and estimated useful life used to account for pooled subscriber system assets (primarily in North America) and related deferred revenue from the straight line method with lives ranging from 10 to 14 years to an accelerated method with lives up to 15 years. The accelerated method utilizes declining balance rates based on geographical area ranging from 160% to 195% for residential subscriber pools and 145% to 265% for commercial subscriber pools and converts to a straight line methodology when the resulting depreciation charge is greater than that from the accelerated method. The Company will continue to use a straight line method with a 14 year life for non pooled subscriber system assets (primarily in Europe and Asia) and related deferred revenue, with remaining balances written off upon customer termination. The change in the method and estimated useful life used to account for pooled subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue resulted from our ongoing analysis of all pertinent factors, including actual customer attrition data specific to customer categories and geographical areas, demand, competition, and the estimated technological life of the installed systems. The pertinent factors have been influenced by managements ongoing customer retention programs, as well as tactical and strategic initiatives to improve service delivery, customer satisfaction, and the credit worthiness of the subscriber customer base. All pertinent factors, including actual customer attrition data specific to customer categories and geographical areas, demand, competition, and the estimated technological life of the installed systems, will continue to be reviewed by the Company at each balance sheet date to assess the continued appropriateness of methods and estimated useful lives. Effective as of the beginning of the third quarter of 2007, Tyco also changed the estimated useful life of dealer intangibles in geographical areas comprising approximately 90% of the net carrying value of dealer intangibles from 12 to 15 years. The Company continues to amortize dealer intangible assets on an accelerated basis. The change in the estimated useful life used to account for dealer intangibles resulted from our ongoing analysis of all pertinent factors, including actual customer attrition data, demand, competition, and the estimated technological life of the installed systems. The pertinent factors have been influenced by managements ongoing customer retention programs, as well as tactical and strategic initiatives to improve service delivery, customer satisfaction, and the credit worthiness of the subscriber customer base. 66 Attrition rates for customers in our ADT Worldwide business were 12.3%, 14.2% and 15.0% on a trailing 12 month basis for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Revenue Recognition Contract sales for the installation of fire protection systems, large security intruder systems and other construction related projects are recorded primarily under the percentage of completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related total cost of the project at completion. The risk of this methodology is its dependence upon estimates of costs at completion, which are subject to the uncertainties inherent in long term contracts. Revisions to cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits each period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they become determinable. If estimates are inaccurate, there is risk that our revenue and profits for the period may be overstated or understated. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other markets participants. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience and trend analysis. Loss Contingencies Accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings, self insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on judgment, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates. Additionally, the Company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. Income Taxes In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and international pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction. Any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. If a change in a valuation allowance occurs, which was established in connection with an acquisition, such adjustment may impact goodwill rather than the income tax provision. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these reserves 67 in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If the tax liabilities relate to tax uncertainties existing at the date of the acquisition of a business, the adjustment of such tax liabilities will result in an adjustment to the goodwill recorded at the date of acquisition. Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually and more frequently if triggering events occur. In performing these assessments, management relies on various factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable transactions and other market data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment. Since judgment is involved in performing fair value measurements used in goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets impairment analyses, there is risk that the carrying values of our goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets may be overstated. We elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for all goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. When testing for goodwill impairment, the Company follows the guidance prescribed in SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." First, the Company compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered potentially impaired and further tests are performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. In the second step of the goodwill impairment test, the Company compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. The Company allocates the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill. Disruptions to our business such as end market conditions and protracted economic weakness, unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units, the divestiture of a significant component of a reporting unit and market capitalization declines may result in our having to perform a goodwill impairment first step valuation analysis for some or all of our reporting units prior to the required annual assessment. These types of events and the resulting analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future. Goodwill impairments related to continuing operations were $46 million during 2007. There were no goodwill impairments related to continuing operations during 2006 and 2005. Long Lived Assets Assets held and used by the Company, including property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. Tyco performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if impairment exists. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, Tyco groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identified. If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Impairments to long lived assets to be disposed of are recorded based upon the fair value of the applicable assets. The calculation of the fair value of long lived assets is based on assumptions concerning the amount and 68 timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of long lived assets, there is a risk that the carrying value of our long lived assets may be overstated or understated. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations. Two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions. The discount rate represents the market rate for high quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our present value of pension obligations by approximately $90 million. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected long term rates of return on those types of plan assets, in determining the expected long term return on plan assets. A 50 basis point decrease in the expected long term return on plan assets would increase our pension expense by approximately $10 million.  Liquidity and Capital Resources The sources of our cash flow from operating activities and the use of a portion of that cash in our operations for the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005 were as follows ($ in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Cash flows from operating activities: Operating (loss) income $ (1,715 ) $ 1,370 $ 1,191 Goodwill impairment 46 Non cash restructuring and asset impairment charges, net 24 2 2 Losses on divestitures 4 2 23 Depreciation and amortization(1) 1,151 1,182 1,204 Non cash compensation expense 173 151 72 Deferred income taxes (11 ) (414 ) (227 ) Provision for losses on accounts receivable and inventory 94 56 102 Other, net(2) 28 (36 ) 147 Class action settlement liability 2,992 Net change in working capital (405 ) 226 125 Interest income 102 43 39 Interest expense (313 ) (279 ) (322 ) Income tax expense (334 ) (310 ) (29 ) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,836 $ 1,993 $ 2,327 Other cash flow items: Capital expenditures, net(3) $ (646 ) $ (519 ) $ (463 ) Decrease in sale of accounts receivable 7 8 8 Acquisition of customer accounts (ADT dealer program) (409 ) (373 ) (328 ) Purchase accounting and holdback liabilities (10 ) (7 ) (14 ) Voluntary pension contributions 23 83 (1)Includes depreciation expense of $638 million, $665 million and $676 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and amortization of intangible assets of $513 million, $517 million and $528 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. (2)Includes the add back of losses on the retirement of debt of $259 million, $1 million and $405 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. (3)Includes net proceeds of $23 million, $39 million and $53 million received for the sale/disposition of property, plant and equipment in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 69  The net change in total working capital was a cash decrease of $405 million in 2007. The components of this change are set forth in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The significant changes in working capital included a $166 million increase in inventories, a $128 million increase in accounts receivable, and $244 million of changes in income taxes, net, which includes a payment of legacy tax liabilities. Additionally, working capital includes the collection of $38 million related to restitution owed by Mark H. Swartz, former Chief Financial Officer and Director, and $98 million related to the restitution owed by L. Dennis Kozlowski, former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. During the third quarter of 2007, Tyco entered into the class action settlement and borrowed under its unsecured bridge loan and revolving credit facilities to fund the $2.992 billion liability, placing the proceeds in escrow for the benefit of the class. During 2007, we completed the sale of the AIJ business for $42 million in net cash proceeds. Additionally, during 2007, we received $271 million due to the liquidation of investments in a rabbi trust, as well as $136 million in restitution payments owed by former executives as described above. We continue to fund capital expenditures to improve the cost structure of our businesses, to invest in new processes and technology, and to maintain high quality production standards. Capital spending increased to $669 million in 2007 from $558 million in 2006. The level of capital expenditures in 2008 is expected to exceed spending levels in 2007 and is also expected to exceed depreciation. In September 2007, Tycos Board of Directors approved a new $1.0 billion share repurchase program under which, we repurchased 1.3 million common shares for $56 million. During the first quarter of 2007 we repurchased 5 million common shares for $659 million completing the $2.0 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in May 2006. This followed the repurchase of 13 million common shares for $1.3 billion in 2006. Additionally during 2006, we completed the $1.5 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in July of 2005 with the repurchase of 11 million common shares for $1.2 billion. In 2006, we commenced the termination of our interest rate and cross currency swaps, which were designated as fair value hedges. During 2007, we terminated the remaining swaps. Such terminations resulted in a net cash inflow of $63 million. During the first quarter of 2007, we launched a $350 million to $400 million company wide restructuring program. During 2007, 2006 and 2005 we paid out $70 million, $32 million and $103 million, respectively, in cash related to restructuring activities. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our restructuring activities. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, related to continuing operations was $650 million in 2007, which included $295 million of legacy tax liability payments of amounts not yet due to the IRS in respect of their examination of our 1997 through 2000 U.S. federal income tax returns (the ultimate resolution of which is uncertain). During 2007, 2006 and 2005, Tyco paid $409 million, $373 million and $328 million of cash, respectively, to acquire approximately 415,000, 401,000 and 364,000 customer contracts for electronic security services through the ADT dealer program. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we paid $10 million, $7 million and $14 million, respectively, in cash for purchase accounting and holdback liabilities. Holdback liabilities represent a portion of the purchase price withheld from the seller pending finalization of the acquisition balance sheet and other contingencies. At September 28, 2007 holdback liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets were $16 million, which are included in other liabilities. At September 28, 2007, $14 million of acquisition liabilities remained on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, of which $4 million are included in accrued and other current liabilities and $10 million are included in other liabilities. 70 As previously discussed, effective June 29, 2007, the Company completed the Separation. In connection with the Separation, we paid $349 million in Separation costs during 2007 and $96 million in 2006, including $256 million and $77 million, respectively, recorded in cash provided by discontinued operating activities. We expect that we will incur the remaining cash outflows related to the Separation during the first six months of fiscal 2008. These amounts will primarily consist of tax restructuring, professional services and employee related costs. Capitalization Shareholders equity was $15.6 billion or $31.50 per share, at September 28, 2007, compared to $35.4 billion or $71.06 per share, at September 29, 2006. Shareholders equity decreased $19.8 billion primarily due to the distribution of Covidien and Tyco Electronics to shareholders. This decrease was also due to net loss of $1.7 billion, the repurchase of common shares by a subsidiary of $727 million, and dividends declared of $668 million, offset by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $883 million. In connection with the Separation, as approved by our Board of Directors, we executed a reverse stock split, and as a result, four Tyco shares were converted into one share. Shareholder approval was obtained at the March 8, 2007 Special General Meeting of Shareholders. Our debt levels decreased significantly as compared to September 29, 2006 primarily due to the debt tenders and Covidien and Tyco Electronics assuming their portion of related borrowings. At September 28, 2007, total debt decreased $5.1 billion to $4.5 billion, as compared to $9.6 billion at September 29, 2006. Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization (total debt and shareholders equity) was 22% at September 28, 2007, which increased slightly as compared to 21% at September 29, 2006 due to the decrease in shareholders equity mentioned above. See Debt Tenders and Bank and Revolving Credit Facilities below for further discussion. Our cash balance decreased to $1.9 billion at September 28, 2007, as compared to $2.2 billion at September 29, 2006. The decrease in cash was primarily due to the debt repayments referred to above and the class action settlement escrow. These decreases were partially offset by cash flows provided by operations and transfers from discontinued operations. As previously discussed, in September 2007, the Board of Directors approved a new $1.0 billion share repurchase program. Pursuant to the program, we may repurchase Tyco shares from time to time in open market purchases at prevailing market prices, in negotiated transactions off the market, or pursuant to an approved 10b5 1 trading plan in accordance with applicable regulations. A Rule 10b5 1 trading plan permits the Company to repurchase its shares during periods when the Company would not normally be active in the trading market due to insider trading laws, provided the plan is adopted when the Company is not aware of material non public information. Under a Rule 10b5 1 trading plan, we would be unable to repurchase shares above a pre determined price per share. Additionally, the maximum number of shares that we may purchase each day would be governed by Rule 10b 18. Dividend payments were $791 million in 2007. On September 13, 2007 Tycos Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend on the Companys common shares of $0.15 per share payable on November 1, 2007 to shareholders of record of Tyco International Ltd. post Separation on October 1, 2007. The timing, declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common shares, however, falls within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including the statutory requirements of Bermuda law, our financial condition and results of operations, the capital requirements of our businesses, industry practice and any other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant. 71 Debt Tenders On April 27, 2007, we announced that, in connection with the Separation, we and certain of our subsidiaries that are issuers of our corporate debt had commenced tender offers to purchase for cash substantially all of our outstanding U.S. dollar denominated public debt, aggregating approximately $6.6 billion. Of this amount, approximately $5.9 billion was non convertible U.S. debt and $750 million was convertible U.S. debt, with maturities from 2007 to 2029. In conjunction with the tender offers, the relevant issuer solicited consents for certain clarifying amendments to the indentures pursuant to which the debt was issued. We received acceptance notices for approximately $2.1 billion, or 36% of our outstanding non convertible U.S. debt and approximately $726 million or 97% of our outstanding convertible U.S. debt. Debt which was not tendered in an amount of approximately $3.8 billion remains with us. Additionally, Tyco International Group S.A., our wholly owned subsidiary organized under the laws of Luxembourg ("TIGSA"), commenced on April 30, 2007 tender offers to purchase for cash all of its outstanding Euro and Pound Sterling denominated public debt, aggregating the equivalent of approximately $1.9 billion, with maturities from 2008 to 2031, issued under its Euro Medium Term Note Programme (the "EMTN Notes") and a consent solicitation for certain clarifying amendments to the fiscal agency agreement pursuant to which the EMTN Notes were issued. We received acceptance notices for approximately $1.5 billion, or 80% of our EMTN Notes. The remaining EMTN Notes were repurchased pursuant to an optional redemption. In connection with the debt tender offers, we incurred a pre tax charge for the early extinguishment of debt of approximately $647 million, for which no tax benefit is available (see Note 5). TIGSAs remaining debt was contributed to Tyco International Finance S.A. ("TIFSA"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and successor company to TIGSA. Bank and Revolving Credit Facilities On April 25, 2007, we, certain of our subsidiaries and a syndicate of banks entered into three 364 day unsecured bridge loan facilities with an aggregate commitment amount of $10 billion. At the end of May 2007, the aggregate commitment amount under these facilities was increased to $12.5 billion. We borrowed approximately $8.9 billion under the unsecured bridge loan facilities to fund our debt tender offers, repay our existing bank credit facilities and to finance the class action settlement. Of this amount, approximately $4.3 billion and $3.6 billion was assigned to Covidien and Tyco Electronics, respectively. We initially guaranteed the new unsecured bridge loan facilities and Covidien and Tyco Electronics each assumed Tycos obligations with respect to their unsecured bridge loan facilities upon the Separation. We no longer guarantee those assumed amounts. This facility has a variable interest rate based on LIBOR. The margin over LIBOR payable by TIFSA can vary based on changes in our credit rating. As of September 28, 2007, our aggregate commitment under our unsecured bridge loan facility was $4.0 billion and $367 million remained outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5%. On October 1, 2007, the commitments with respect to the unused portion of our unsecured bridge loan facility expired. Our unsecured revolving credit facility described below and our letter of credit facility described in Commitments and Contingencies Contractual Obligations, provide the lenders under those facilities with the right to demand repayment of outstanding amounts, and to terminate commitments to extend additional credit, if (i) certain of our outstanding public debt is declared due and payable and (ii) we do not have sufficient liquidity available under our unsecured bridge loan facility to refinance such debt. As a result, on November 27, 2007, we secured additional firm commitments from certain of our lenders under the bridge loan facility. These additional commitments provide us with sufficient liquidity to repay the outstanding public debt with borrowings of up to 72 $4.0 billion. The additional commitments expire on, and any borrowings under the facility would mature on, November 25, 2008. The facility may only be used to repay, settle or otherwise extinguish the public debt described above, which is the subject of ongoing litigation between us and The Bank of New York. For more information regarding such litigation, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Indenture Trustee Litigation. Additionally, on April 25, 2007, we, certain of our subsidiaries and a syndicate of banks entered into three unsecured revolving credit facilities with an initial aggregate commitment amount of $2.5 billion that increased to $4.25 billion at the time of the Separation. Of the aggregate commitment amount of $4.25 billion, a $1.25 billion commitment is available to us, and a $1.5 billion commitment was available to each of Covidien and Tyco Electronics. We will use the revolving credit facilities for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes. We initially guaranteed the new revolving credit facilities and Covidien and Tyco Electronics each assumed our obligations with respect to their revolving credit facilities upon the Separation. We no longer guarantee those assumed amounts. At September 28, 2007, we have borrowed $308 million under our unsecured revolving credit facility. This facility has a variable interest rate based on LIBOR. The margin over LIBOR payable by TIFSA can vary based on changes in our credit rating. The unsecured revolving credit facilities replaced TIGSAs existing $1.0 billion 5 year revolving credit facility and $1.5 billion 3 year revolving bank credit facility, which were terminated by June 1, 2007 prior to their scheduled expiration dates of December 16, 2009 and December 21, 2007, respectively. On the date of termination, no amounts were borrowed under these facilities. TIFSAs bank credit agreements contain customary terms and conditions, and financial covenants that limit the ratio of our debt to our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and that limit our ability to incur subsidiary debt or grant liens on our property. Our indentures contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges, subsidiary debt and sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are considered restrictive to our business. We believe we are in compliance with all of our debt covenants. The Bank of New York, as indenture trustee under indentures dated as of June 9, 1998 and November 12, 2003, is contesting whether the Separation transactions were permitted under such indentures. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings Indenture Trustee Litigation. The following table details our long term debt ratings at September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006: 2007 2006 Moodys Baa1 Baa3 Standard & Poors BBB BBB+ Fitch BBB BBB+ The security ratings set forth above are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 73  Commitments and Contingencies Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations and commitments for principal debt, minimum lease payment obligations under non cancelable operating leases and other obligations at September 28, 2007 is as follows ($ in millions): 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Debt(1)(2) $ 372 $ 517 $ 1 $ 517 $ 1,158 $ 1,848 $ 4,413 Capital leases(1) 8 7 6 4 2 37 64 Operating leases 291 226 171 123 72 157 1,040 Purchase obligations(3) 114 7 3 124 Total contractual cash obligations(4) $ 785 $ 757 $ 181 $ 644 $ 1,232 $ 2,042 $ 5,641 (1)Excludes interest. (2)Excludes debt discount and swap activity. (3)Purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of good and services. (4)Other long term liabilities primarily consist of the following: pension and postretirement costs, income taxes, warranty and environmental liabilities and are excluded from this table. We are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type. The minimum required contributions to our pension plans are expected to be approximately $69 million in 2008 and we expect to pay $7 million in 2008 related to postretirement benefit plans. At September 28, 2007, TIFSA had unsecured credit facilities of $1.25 billion due April 25, 2012, of which approximately $0.9 billion was undrawn and available (see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, certain of the Companys operating subsidiaries have uncommitted overdraft and similar types of facilities, which total $55 million, of which $51 million was undrawn and available. These facilities expire at various dates through the year 2009, most of which are renewable and are established primarily within our international operations. On June 21, 2007, Tyco and TIFSA entered into a new $500 million letter of credit facility, with Citibank N.A. as administrative agent, expiring on December 15, 2007. The facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit, supported by a related line of credit facility. TIFSA may only borrow under the line of credit agreement to reimburse the bank for obligations with respect to letters of credit issued under this facility. The covenants under this facility are substantially similar to the covenants under the bridge loan and revolving credit facilities. TIFSA would pay interest on any outstanding borrowings at a variable interest rate, based on the banks base rate or the Eurodollar rate, as defined. As of September 28, 2007, letters of credit of $494 million have been issued under the $500 million credit facility and $6 million remains available for issuance. There were no amounts borrowed under this credit facility at September 28, 2007. On October 19, 2007, the facility was amended. The amendment extended the maturity date to June 15, 2008 and adjusted the interest rate spreads and fees applicable to extensions of credit thereunder. Loans under the amended letter of credit agreement will continue to bear interest based on LIBOR plus the applicable margin. At September 28, 2007, the Company had total outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees of $1.1 billion. In the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In connection with the Separation, the Company entered into a liability sharing agreement regarding certain class actions that were pending against Tyco prior to the Separation. Subject to the 74 terms and conditions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Company will manage and control all the legal matters related to assumed contingent liabilities as described in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, including the defense or settlement thereof, subject to certain limitations. Tyco has assumed 27%, Covidien has assumed 42% and Tyco Electronics has assumed 31% of certain Tyco pre Separation contingent and other corporate liabilities, which include securities class action litigation, ERISA class action litigation, certain legacy tax contingencies and any actions with respect to the spin offs or the distributions made or brought by any third party except for litigation related to our public debt. Any amounts relating to these contingent and other corporate liabilities paid by Tyco after the spin offs that are subject to the allocation provisions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement will be shared among Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics pursuant to the same allocation ratio. As described in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Tyco, Tyco Electronics and Covidien are jointly and severally liable for all amounts relating to the previously disclosed securities class action settlement. All costs and expenses that Tyco incurs in connection with the defense of such litigation, other than the amount of any judgment or settlement, which will be allocated in the manner described above, will be borne equally by Covidien, Tyco Electronics and Tyco. Legal Matters Class Actions For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos securities class actions, class action settlement, securities class action proceedings, shareholder derivative litigation, ERISA related litigation, Tyco litigation against former senior management, litigation related to our public debt and various other legal matters, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings. We are generally obligated to indemnify our directors and officers and our former directors and officers who are named as defendants in some or all of these matters to the extent required by Bermuda law. In addition, our insurance carriers may decline coverage, or our coverage may be insufficient to cover our expenses and liability, in some or all of these matters. While we may from time to time seek to engage plaintiffs counsel in settlement discussions, we are unable at this time to estimate what our ultimate liability in these matters may be, and it is possible that we will be required to pay judgments or settlements and incur expenses, in excess of any insurance coverage, in aggregate amounts that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Investigations For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to governmental investigations related to Tyco, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Subpoenas and Document Requests From Governmental Entities. We cannot predict when these investigations will be completed, nor can we predict what the results of these investigations may be. It is possible that we will be required to pay material fines, consent to injunctions on future conduct, lose the ability to conduct business with government entities or instrumentalities (which in turn could negatively impact our business with non governmental customers) or suffer other penalties or adverse impacts, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. It is not possible to estimate the amount of loss, or range of possible loss, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters. Environmental Matters For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos environmental matters, see Item 1. Business Environmental Matters. 75  Asbestos Matters Tyco and some of its subsidiaries and certain subsidiaries of Covidien are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Covidien has assumed all liabilities for pending cases filed against Covidiens subsidiaries. Consistent with the national trend of increased asbestos related litigation, the Company has observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits in the past several years. A limited number of the cases allege premises liability, based on claims that individuals were exposed to asbestos while on a subsidiarys property. A majority of the cases involve product liability claims, based principally on allegations of past distribution of heat resistant industrial products incorporating asbestos or the past distribution of industrial valves that incorporated asbestos containing gaskets or packing. Each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants. Tycos involvement in asbestos cases has been limited because its subsidiaries did not mine or produce asbestos. Furthermore, in the Companys experience, a large percentage of these claims were never substantiated and have been dismissed by the courts. The Company will continue to vigorously defend the lawsuits that have been filed against it and its subsidiaries. To date, the Company has not suffered an adverse verdict in a trial court proceeding related to asbestos claims. When appropriate, the Company settles claims; however, the total amount paid in any year to settle and defend all asbestos claims has been immaterial. As of September 28, 2007, there were approximately 5,600 asbestos liability cases pending against the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company estimates its pending asbestos claims that were incurred but not reported, as well as related insurance and indemnification recoveries. The Companys estimate of the liability for pending and future claims is based on claim experience over the past five years and covers claims expected to be filed over the next seven years. The Company believes that it has adequate amounts recorded related to these matters. While it is not possible at this time to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome of these asbestos related proceedings, the Company believes that the final outcome of all known and anticipated future claims, after taking into account its substantial indemnification rights and insurance coverage, will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Income Taxes Tyco and its subsidiaries income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. The Company is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest that management has assessed as probable and estimable have been recorded. For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos income taxes, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Income Tax Matters. Compliance Matters Tyco has received and responded to various allegations and other information that certain improper payments were made by Tyco subsidiaries in recent years. As previously reported, we have been informed that two subsidiaries in our Flow Control business in Italy have been named in a request for criminal charges filed by the Milan public prosecutors office. Tyco has reported to the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the SEC the investigative steps and remedial measures that it has taken in response to the allegations. Tyco also informed the DOJ and the SEC that it has retained outside counsel to perform a company wide baseline review of its policies, controls and practices with respect to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), that it would continue to make periodic progress reports to these agencies, and that it would present its factual findings upon conclusion of the baseline review. The Company has and will continue to communicate with the DOJ 76 and SEC to provide updates on the baseline review being conducted by outside counsel, including, as appropriate, briefings concerning additional instances of potential improper payments identified by the Company in the course of its ongoing compliance activities. Covidien and Tyco Electronics agreed, in connection with the Separation, to cooperate with the Company in its response to these allegations. To date, the baseline review has revealed that some business practices may not comply with Tyco and FCPA requirements. At this time, Tyco cannot predict the outcome of these matters and other allegations reported to regulatory and law enforcement authorities and therefore cannot estimate the range of potential loss or extent of risk, if any, that may result from an adverse resolution of these matters. However, it is possible that the Company may be required to pay judgments, suffer penalties or incur settlements in amounts that may have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos compliance matters, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Compliance Matters. Other Matters The Company is a party to a contract dispute arising from Earth Techs contract with the City of Phoenix, Arizona for the expansion of the Citys 91st Avenue Waste Water Treatment Plant. Both Earth Tech and the City of Phoenix have filed lawsuits in the local county superior court alleging the other party has breached the contract. At this time, Tyco cannot predict the outcome of this matter and therefore cannot estimate the range of potential loss or extent of risk, if any, that may result from an adverse resolution of this matter. For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos other matters, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Other Matters. The Company is a defendant in a number of other pending legal proceedings incidental to present and former operations, acquisitions and dispositions. The Company does not expect the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Backlog At September 28, 2007, we had a backlog of unfilled orders of $9.1 billion, compared to a backlog of $8.2 billion at September 29, 2006. We expect that approximately 86% of our backlog at September 28, 2007 will be filled during 2008. Backlog by segment at September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006 is as follows ($ in millions): 2007 2006 ADT Worldwide $ 6,137 $ 5,776 Fire Protection Services 1,108 1,050 Flow Control 1,579 1,115 Safety Products 144 133 Electrical and Metal Products 113 101 Corporate and Other 4 3 $ 9,085 $ 8,178 Within ADT Worldwide, backlog increased primarily as a result of strong bookings across all regions. Backlog for ADT Worldwide also includes recurring revenue in force, which represents 12 months fees for monitoring and maintenance services under contract in the security business. The amount of recurring revenue in force at September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006 was $3.93 billion and $3.65 billion, respectively. Backlog within Fire Protection Services increased primarily as a result of increased orders in North America. Flow Control had increased bookings mostly in the Asia Pacific and Europe regions. 77  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale of Accounts Receivable Certain of Tycos international businesses utilize the sale of accounts receivable as short term financing mechanisms. The aggregate amount outstanding under the Companys remaining international accounts receivable programs was $76 million, $75 million and $79 million at September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005, respectively. Guarantees Certain of the Companys business segments have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from 2008 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. There are certain guarantees or indemnifications extended among Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics in accordance with the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Tax Sharing Agreement. At the time of the Separation, Tyco recorded a liability necessary to recognize the fair value of such guarantees and indemnifications in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation ("FIN") No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." Fair values were determined with the assistance of a third party valuation firm. The liability necessary to reflect the fair value of these guarantees and indemnifications is $543 million, which is included in other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the Tax Sharing Agreement. See Note 16 for further discussion of the Tax Sharing Agreement. In addition, Tyco historically provided support in the form of financial and or performance guarantees to various Covidien and Tyco Electronics operating entities. In connection with the Separation, the Company worked with the guarantee counterparties to cancel or assign these guarantees to Covidien or Tyco Electronics. To the extent these guarantees were not assigned prior to the Separation date, Tyco assumed primary liability on any remaining support. The estimated fair values of those obligations are $7 million, which are included in other liabilities with an offset to shareholders equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and were recorded in accordance with FIN No. 45. In disposing of assets or businesses, the Company often provides representations, warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. The Company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the Company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. In the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 78  The Company records estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. For further information on estimated product warranty, see Notes 1 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2001, a division of Safety Products initiated a Voluntary Replacement Program ("VRP") associated with the acquisition of Central Sprinkler. The VRP relates to the replacement of certain O ring seal sprinkler heads which were originally manufactured by Central Sprinkler prior to Tycos acquisition. Under this program, the sprinkler heads are being replaced free of charge to property owners. In the third quarter of 2006, the Company completed a comprehensive review of reported claims, recent claim rates and cost trends and further assessed the future of the program. The Company determined that an additional liability was necessary in order to satisfy the Companys obligation under the VRP. As a result, the Company recorded a $100 million charge which was reflected in cost of sales. On May 1, 2007, the Consumer Products Safety Commission and the Company announced an August 31, 2007 deadline for filing claims to participate in the VRP. The Company will fulfill all valid claims for replacement of qualifying sprinklers received up to August 31, 2007. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company further assessed the expected cost to complete the program in light of the most current claims data and determined that an additional accrual of $10 million was necessary to satisfy the estimated remaining obligation. The ultimate cost to complete the program will be impacted by a number of factors such as changes in material and labor costs, and the actual number of sprinkler heads replaced. Actual results could differ from this estimate. Settlements during 2007 include cash expenditures of $38 million related to the VRP.  Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)." SFAS No. 158 requires that employers recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as a net asset or liability on the balance sheet and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. Under SFAS No. 158, companies are required to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of their fiscal year end. The Company presently uses a measurement date of August 31st. SFAS No. 158 also requires additional disclosure in the notes to the financial statements. The recognition provisions of SFAS No. 158 are effective for fiscal 2007, while the measurement date provisions become effective in fiscal 2009. The Company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158 as of September 28, 2007. The Company recognized a net $111 million liability through a reduction in shareholders equity. In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 108, "Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements." SAB No. 108 requires that companies utilize a "dual approach" in assessing the quantitative effects of financial statement misstatements. The dual approach includes both an income statement focused and balance sheet focused assessment. SAB No. 108 is effective for Tyco in fiscal 2007. The implementation of SAB No. 108 did not have a material impact on Tycos results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities." SFAS No. 159 permits an entity, on a contract by contract basis, to make an irrevocable election to account for certain types of financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value, rather than historical cost, with changes in the fair value, whether realized or unrealized, recognized in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for Tyco in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. 79 The Company is currently assessing the impact that SFAS No. 159 will have on the results of its operations, financial position or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements," which enhances existing guidance for measuring assets and liabilities at fair value. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for Tyco beginning in fiscal 2009. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, that SFAS No. 157 will have on the results of its operations, financial position or cash flows. In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109." This Interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. FIN No. 48 is effective for Tyco in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The Company is currently implementing and assessing the expected impact of adopting FIN No. 48. Based on the assessment to date, management does not expect the adoption to have a material effect on the results of its operations, financial position or cash flows.  Forward Looking Information Certain statements in this report are "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. All statements contained herein that are not clearly historical in nature are forward looking, and the words "anticipate," "believe," "expect," "estimate," "project" and similar expressions are generally intended to identify forward looking statements. Any forward looking statement contained herein, in press releases, written statements or other documents filed with the SEC, or in Tycos communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, web casts, phone calls and conference calls, regarding expectations with respect to sales, earnings, cash flows, operating efficiencies, product expansion, backlog, the consummation and benefits of acquisitions and divestitures, the Separation or other matters, as well as financings and repurchases of debt or equity securities, are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and contingencies. Many of these risks, uncertainties and contingencies are beyond our control, and may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from anticipated results, performance or achievements. Factors that might affect such forward looking statements include, among other things: overall economic and business conditions; the demand for Tycos goods and services; competitive factors in the industries in which Tyco competes; changes in tax requirements (including tax rate changes, new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations); results and consequences of Tycos internal investigation and governmental investigations concerning the Companys governance, management, internal controls and operations including its business operations outside the United States; the outcome of litigation and governmental proceedings as a result of actions taken by our former senior corporate management; effect of income tax audit settlements; the ratings on our debt and our ability to repay or refinance our outstanding indebtedness as it matures; 80 our ability to operate within the limitations imposed by financing arrangements and to maintain our credit ratings; interest rate fluctuations and other changes in borrowing costs; other capital market conditions, including currency exchange rate fluctuations; availability of and fluctuations in the prices of key raw materials, including steel and copper; economic and political conditions in international markets, including governmental changes and restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders; the ability to achieve cost savings in connection with the Companys strategic restructuring and Six Sigma initiatives; potential further impairment of our goodwill and or our long lived assets; the impact of fluctuations in the price of Tyco common shares; changes in U.S. and non U.S. governmental laws and regulations; the possible effects on Tyco of future legislation in the United States that may limit or eliminate potential U.S. tax benefits resulting from Tycos incorporation in Bermuda or deny U.S. government contracts to Tyco based upon its incorporation in Bermuda; and the potential distraction costs associated with negative publicity relating to actions of our former senior corporate management. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the ordinary course of conducting business, we are exposed to certain risks associated with potential changes in market conditions. These risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Accordingly, we have established a comprehensive risk management process to monitor, evaluate and manage the principal exposures we assume. We seek to manage these risks through the use of financial derivative instruments. Our portfolio of derivative financial instruments may, from time to time, include forward foreign currency exchange contracts, cross currency swaps, foreign currency options, and interest rate swaps. Derivative financial instruments related to interest rate sensitivity of debt obligations, intercompany cross border transactions and anticipated non functional currency cash flows are used with the goal of mitigating a significant portion of these exposures when it is cost effective to do so. We do not execute transactions or utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, to reduce the risk that a counterparty will be unable to honor its contractual obligations to us, we only enter into contracts with counterparties having at least an A/A2 long term debt rating. These counterparties are generally financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one party. During fiscal year 2007, the Company elected to change its presentation of market risk information from a tabular format to a disclosure based on the results of sensitivity analysis. Management believes this method of presentation provides more useful information for assessing the Companys overall exposure to market risks. The results of our sensitivity analysis represent an estimate of reasonably possible outcomes based on hypothetical market conditions and are not necessarily indicative of actual results. Although, there were no material changes in our primary risk exposures and risk management activities, our level of exposure decreased across all risk categories as a result of the spin off of our Healthcare and Electronics businesses. 81 Foreign Currency Exposures We economically hedge our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts and options. During 2007, our largest exposures to foreign exchange rates existed primarily with the British Pound, Euro, Brazilian Real, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar against the U.S. Dollar. The market risk related to the forward foreign exchange contracts is measured by estimating the potential impact of a 10% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates. The rates used to perform this analysis were based on the market rates in effect on September 28, 2007. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in a $248 million net increase in the fair value of the contracts. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in a $303 million net decrease in the fair value of the contracts. However, gains or losses on these derivative instruments are economically offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. Previously, we hedged our investment in certain foreign operations. In December 2006, due to required changes to the legal entity structure to facilitate the Separation, the Company determined that it will no longer consider certain intercompany foreign currency transactions to be long term investments. As a result, the related foreign currency transaction gains and losses on such investments were recorded in the income statement subsequent to this determination rather than to the currency translation component of shareholders equity. Forward contracts that were previously designated as hedges of these net investments continued to be used to manage this exposure but were no longer designated as net investment hedges. Also in connection with the Separation and the debt tender, the Company de designated its 6.125% Euro denominated public notes due 2007 on March 29, 2007, its 5.5% Euro denominated public notes due 2008 and its 6.5% British Pound denominated public notes due 2031 on May 21, 2007, that had previously been considered as hedges of net investments in certain foreign operations. At September 28, 2007, the Company did not hedge its net investment in foreign operations, and all of its outstanding borrowings were denominated in U.S. dollars. Interest Rate Exposures Our long term debt portfolio primarily consists of fixed rate instruments. Historically, the Company managed its exposure to interest rates by entering into interest rate and cross currency swaps designated as fair value hedges. In assessing the potential risks related to movements in interest rates, we terminated the interest rate and cross currency swaps in several tranches beginning in the fourth quarter of 2006. During the first quarter of 2007, we terminated the remaining contracts with a total notional amount of $0.6 billion, resulting in an aggregate terminated notional amount of $3.1 billion. The settlement of these swaps resulted in a net cash inflow of $63 million for the first quarter of 2007. Since the interest rate swaps were designated as hedging instruments of outstanding debt, the related $32 million loss adjustment to the carrying value of the related debt will be amortized over the remaining life of the related debt instruments. In connection with the debt tender offer, $9 million of unamortized loss on interest rate swaps was accelerated and recorded as a loss on retirement of debt and included in other expense, net (see Note 13). At September 28, 2007 there were no interest rate swaps outstanding. Commodity Exposures We are exposed to volatility in the prices of raw materials used in some of our products and may, in limited circumstances, enter into hedging contracts to manage those exposures. These exposures are monitored as an integral part of our risk management program. At September 28, 2007, the Company did not hedge its exposure attributable to changes in commodity prices but may consider such strategies in the future. 82 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the Selected Financial Data and our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those under the headings "Risk Factors" and "Forward Looking Information." Introduction The Consolidated Financial Statements include the consolidated results of Tyco International Ltd., a company organized under the laws of Bermuda, and its subsidiaries (hereinafter collectively referred to as "we," the "Company" or "Tyco") and have been prepared in United States dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). In connection with the Separation, Tyco Healthcare changed its name to Covidien Ltd. ("Covidien"). As Covidien and Tyco Electronics historically accounted for 55% of our revenues, we have realigned our management and segment reporting structure and report financial and operating information in the following five segments, effective March 31, 2007: ADT Worldwide designs, sells, installs, services and monitors electronic security systems to residential, commercial, industrial and governmental customers. Fire Protection Services designs, sells, installs and services fire detection and fire suppression systems to commercial, industrial and governmental customers. Flow Control designs, manufactures, sells and services valves, pipes, fittings, valve automation and heat tracing products for the water and wastewater markets, the oil, gas and other energy markets along with general process industries. Safety Products designs, manufactures and sells fire protection, security and life safety products, including fire suppression products, breathing apparatus, intrusion security, access control and video management systems. In addition, Safety Products manufactures products installed and serviced by ADT Worldwide and Fire Protection Services. Electrical and Metal Products designs, manufactures and sells steel tubing and pipe products, as well as cable products, including pre wired armored cable and flexible conduit products for commercial construction. We also provide general corporate services to our segments and these costs are reported as Corporate and Other. During the fourth quarter of 2007, Infrastructure Services, previously reported as part of Corporate and Other, met the held for sale criteria and has been included in discontinued operations in all periods presented. References to the segment data are to the Companys continuing operations. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to exclude the results of discontinued operations. Overview Effective June 29, 2007, Tyco completed the spin offs of Covidien and Tyco Electronics, formerly Healthcare and Electronics businesses, respectively, into separate, publicly traded companies (the "Separation") in the form of a distribution to Tyco shareholders. The distribution was made on June 29, 2007, to Tyco shareholders of record on June 18, 2007, the record date. Each Tyco shareholder received 0.25 of a common share of each of Covidien and Tyco Electronics for each Tyco common 49 share held on the record date. Tyco shareholders received cash in lieu of fractional shares for amounts of less than one Covidien or Tyco Electronics common share. The distribution was structured to be tax free to Tyco shareholders except to the extent of cash received in lieu of fractional shares. As a result of the distribution, the operations of Tycos former Healthcare and Electronics businesses are now classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented. Additionally, on the distribution date, the Company, as approved by its Board of Directors, effected a reverse stock split of Tycos common shares, at a split ratio of one for four. Shareholder approval for the reverse stock split was obtained at the March 8, 2007 Special General Meeting of Shareholders. Share and per share data for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split. We have and will continue to incur separation costs related to debt refinancing, tax restructuring, professional services and employee related costs. We currently estimate that the total income statement charges will be approximately $1.4 billion, after tax, much of which will be reflected as discontinued operations. During 2007 and 2006, the Company incurred pre tax costs related to the Separation, including the $647 million loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2007, of $1,083 million and $169 million, respectively. Of this amount, $105 million and $49 million is included in separation costs, $259 million and $0 million related to loss on early extinguishment of debt is included in other expense, net and $719 million and $120 million is included in discontinued operations, respectively. Most of the remaining charges are expected to be incurred during the first six months of fiscal 2008. Additionally, 2007 includes tax charges related to the Separation primarily for the write off of deferred tax assets that will no longer be realizable of $183 million, of which $95 million is included in income taxes and $88 million is included in discontinued operations. On April 27, 2007, in connection with the Separation, Tyco and certain of its subsidiaries that are issuers of its corporate debt commenced tender offers to purchase for cash substantially all of its outstanding U.S. dollar denominated public debt. Additionally, on April 30, 2007, Tyco International Group S.A., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("TIGSA"), commenced tender offers to purchase for cash all of its outstanding Euro and Pound Sterling denominated public debt. In connection with the debt tender offers, Tyco incurred a pre tax charge for the early extinguishment of debt of approximately $647 million, for which no tax benefit is available. In connection with the Separation, during the third quarter of 2007 we reorganized to a new management and segment reporting structure. As part of these organizational changes, we assessed new reporting units, assigned goodwill to the new reporting units and tested goodwill for impairment. As a result, we recognized a goodwill impairment of $46 million in 2007 in the ADT Worldwide segment. We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. In September 2007, Tycos Board of Directors approved a new $1.0 billion share repurchase program under which, we repurchased 1.3 million of our common shares for $56 million. During 2007 we also completed the $2.0 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in May 2006. Additionally, during 2006 we completed the $1.5 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in July of 2005. During 2007, we paid dividends of $791 million to shareholders. On September 13, 2007 Tycos Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend on the Companys common shares of $0.15 per share payable on November 1, 2007 to shareholders of record of Tyco International Ltd. post Separation on October 1, 2007. During 2007, we sold Aquas Industriales de Jose, C.A. ("AIJ"), a joint venture that was majority owned by Infrastructure Services, for $42 million in net cash proceeds and a pre tax gain of $19 million was recorded. AIJ met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and has been included in discontinued operations in all periods presented. 50 We are continuing to assess the strategic fit of our various businesses and are considering additional divestitures where businesses do not align with our long term vision. Tyco will explore a number of strategic alternatives for under performing or non strategic businesses including possible divestiture. In July 2007, the Board of Directors approved for divestiture Infrastructure Services which was previously reported as part of Corporate and Other. Infrastructure Services had total net revenue of $1.3 billion and operating income of $53 million in 2007. Infrastructure Services met the held for sale criteria in the fourth quarter of 2007 and has been included in discontinued operations in all periods presented. To further improve operating efficiency, during the first quarter of 2007, we launched a restructuring program across all segments, including the corporate organization, which will streamline some of the businesses and reduce the operational footprint. We expect to incur charges related to the program of approximately $350 million to $400 million through the end of 2008. During 2007, we incurred charges of $204 million, of which $7 million was recorded in cost of sales, and utilized cash of $70 million related to this program. We believe this restructuring program will strengthen our competitive position over the long term. Class Action Settlement On May 14, 2007, Tyco entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with plaintiffs counsel in connection with the settlement of 32 purported securities class action lawsuits. Under the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding, the plaintiffs agreed to release all claims against Tyco, the other settling defendants and ten other individuals in consideration for the payment of $2.975 billion from Tyco to the certified class. The parties to the Memorandum of Understanding have applied to the court for approval of the settlement agreement. On July 13, 2007, the U. S. District Court in Concord, New Hampshire granted preliminary approval of the settlement. On November 2, 2007, the final fairness hearing for the class settlement was held. The Court indicated it would approve the settlement and stated a formal ruling would be issued in a few weeks. If the settlement agreement does not receive final court approval, the Memorandum of Understanding will be null and void. By December 28, 2007, class participants must file their proofs of claim demonstrating their right to recovery under the class settlement. The deadline for deciding not to participate in the class settlement was September 28, 2007. As of such date, Tyco had received opt out notices from individuals and entities totaling approximately 4% of the shares owned by class members. These individuals and entities may pursue their claims separately against Tyco and any judgments resulting from such claims would not reduce the settlement amount. One entity, Franklin Mutual Advisers, LLC, has filed a complaint against Tyco on September 24, 2007 in an action styled Franklin Mutual Advisers, LLC v. Tyco International Ltd. in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging violations of Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 77(b), Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 78(b), and Rule 10b 5 promulgated thereunder and Section 18 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 78(k) in connection with the plaintiffs purchases and sales of Tyco securities between June 4, 2001 and April 30, 2002. The plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory damages and reasonable attorneys fees and costs. Tyco has requested that this action be transferred to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. Tyco intends to vigorously defend the litigation. It is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome or to estimate the amount of loss or range of possible loss, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of the Franklin matter or other unasserted claims from individuals that have opted out. 51  Under the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement entered into in connection with the Separation, each of Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics are jointly and severally liable for the full amount of the class action settlement and any judgments resulting from opt out claims. Additionally, under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the companies share in the liability and related escrow accounts, with Tyco assuming 27%, Covidien 42% and Tyco Electronics 31% of the settlement amount. Tyco incurred a charge to expense, for which no tax benefit is available, and a current liability of $2.975 billion in 2007. The Company has also recovered or expects to recover certain of these costs from insurers. As such, the Company recorded $113 million of recoveries in connection with the class action settlement in its Consolidated Statements of Operations. Tyco borrowed under its unsecured bridge and credit facilities to fund the liability and placed the proceeds in escrow for the benefit of the class. In connection with the Separation, Covidien and Tyco Electronics assumed their portion of the related borrowing. The escrow accounts will earn interest that is payable to the class. Interest is also accrued on the class action settlement liability. Based on the Separation and Distribution Agreement, at September 28, 2007 Tyco had a receivable from Covidien and Tyco Electronics for their portion of the liability of $1,257 million and $927 million, respectively, and a payable to Covidien and Tyco Electronics for their interest in the escrow accounts. Receivables and payables that pertain to the class action settlement and related escrow accounts with the same counterparty are presented net in the consolidated balance sheet. Tycos portion of the liability is $808 million. Additionally, Tyco has paid $73 million and recorded payables of $9 million at September 28, 2007, with an offset to shareholders equity for amounts due to Covidien and Tyco Electronics for their portion of the insurance recovery. Operating Results Net revenue and net income for the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005 were as follows ($ in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Revenue from product sales $ 12,095 $ 10,974 $ 10,342 Service revenue 6,686 6,362 6,323 Net revenue $ 18,781 $ 17,336 $ 16,665 Operating (loss) income $ (1,715 ) $ 1,370 $ 1,191 Interest income 102 43 39 Interest expense (313 ) (279 ) (322 ) Other expense, net (255 ) (296 ) (Loss) income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest (2,181 ) 1,134 612 Income taxes (334 ) (310 ) (29 ) Minority interest (4 ) (1 ) (2 ) (Loss) income from continuing operations (2,519 ) 823 581 Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes 777 2,781 2,492 (Loss) income before cumulative effect of accounting change (1,742 ) 3,604 3,073 Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of income taxes (14 ) 21 Net (loss) income $ (1,742 ) $ 3,590 $ 3,094 Net revenue increased $1.4 billion, or 8.3%, for 2007 as compared to 2006 as a result of growth in all of our segments. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by Flow Control as a result of volume growth from continued strength in most industrial end markets. In addition, ADT Worldwide had strong growth in Asia and Latin America, as well as growth in its recurring revenue base and 52 contracting revenue in North America. Fire Protection Services experienced continued growth in electronic and mechanical contracting. Foreign currency exchange rates positively affected 2007 by $586 million while the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures negatively affected 2007 by $48 million. Operating income decreased $3.1 billion for 2007. Operating income was primarily impacted by the class action settlement charge, net of $2.862 billion. Revenue growth in all segments was partially offset by lower margins in Electrical and Metal Products primarily due to unfavorable spreads on both steel and copper products. Additionally, operating income was impacted by costs incurred relating to the Separation and the restructuring program announced in November 2006. Separation related costs impacted operating income by $105 million for 2007 and $49 million for 2006. Restructuring and asset impairment charges, net impacted operating income by $217 million for 2007. Also impacting operating income was a goodwill impairment charge of $46 million due to the reorganization into our new management and segment reporting structure. Divestiture charges impacted 2007 by $4 million. Restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net were $15 million for 2006. Net revenue increased $671 million, or 4.0%, for 2006 as compared to 2005 as a result of growth in four of our segments. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by Flow Control as a result of volume growth from strength in most industrial end markets. In addition, revenue growth was favorably impacted by increased selling prices of armored cable products due to higher costs of copper within Electrical and Metal Products during 2006. Foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected 2006 by $85 million while the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures negatively affected the period by $118 million. Operating income increased $179 million, or 15.0%, for 2006 while operating margin increased 0.8 percentage points to 7.9%. The increase in operating income was driven by growth in three of our segments as well as reduced operating expenses in corporate, partially offset by lower margins in ADT Worldwide and Safety Products. Operating income for 2006 was unfavorably affected by a $100 million charge relating to a pre existing voluntary replacement program for certain sprinkler heads, incremental stock option charges of $84 million as required under SFAS No. 123R, "Share Based Payments," Separation related costs of $49 million and net restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges of $15 million. Operating income for 2006 also included $72 million of income related to the extinguishment of certain payment obligations under a split dollar life insurance policy and rabbi trust pursuant to a settlement with Mr. Kozlowski, former Chief Executive Officer, and $48 million of income resulting from a reduction in our estimated workers compensation liabilities primarily due to favorable claims experience. Operating income during 2005 was negatively affected by net restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges of $40 million. In addition, 2005 was unfavorably affected by a charge of $50 million related to an SEC enforcement action and a $70 million charge for estimated contingencies related to contested legal proceedings seeking to enforce retention agreements for five former executives. 53 Results by Geographic Area Net revenue by geographic area for the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005 was as follows ($ in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Net revenue(1): United States $ 8,884 $ 8,613 $ 8,161 Other Americas 1,445 1,358 1,255 Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") 5,462 4,825 4,876 Asia Pacific 2,990 2,540 2,373 $ 18,781 $ 17,336 $ 16,665 (1)Revenue is attributed to individual countries based on the reporting entity that records the transaction. Segment Results The segment discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in results for each of our realigned segments included in continuing operations. ADT Worldwide Net revenue, operating income and operating margin for ADT Worldwide for the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005 were as follows ($ in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Revenue from product sales $ 2,734 $ 2,546 $ 2,471 Service revenue 4,914 4,659 4,633 Net revenue $ 7,648 $ 7,205 $ 7,104 Operating income $ 842 $ 907 $ 952 Operating margin 11.0 % 12.6 % 13.4 % Net revenue by geographic area for ADT Worldwide for the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005 was as follows ($ in millions): 2007 2006 2005 North America $ 4,093 $ 3,980 $ 3,930 Europe, Middle East and Africa 2,574 2,368 2,399 Rest of World 981 857 775 $ 7,648 $ 7,205 $ 7,104 Net revenue for ADT Worldwide increased 6.1% during 2007, with product revenue up 7.4% and service revenue up 5.5%, as compared to 2006. Revenue from product sales includes sales and installation of electronic security and other systems. Service revenue is comprised of electronic security services and maintenance, including the monitoring of burglar alarms, fire alarms and other life safety systems as well as services related to retailer anti theft systems. The 2.8% revenue growth in North America resulted largely from an increase in commercial installations, primarily in the retailer market, as well as an increase in the recurring revenue base. Revenue in the EMEA region grew 8.7%, primarily driven by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The 14.5% revenue growth in the Rest of World geographies was primarily driven by strong growth in Asia and Latin America and, to a lesser extent, favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Overall, net revenue was 54 favorably affected by $213 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates while the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures unfavorably impacted net revenue by $3 million. North America is the most profitable geographic area for ADT Worldwide with 2007 and 2006 operating margin of 17.1% and 16.6%, respectively. ADT EMEA, while profitable with 2007 and 2006 operating margin of 3.1% and 6.3%, respectively, has strong future prospects but is not performing to the level we believe is attainable. As part of our long term program to improve profitability in ADT EMEA, several specific actions have been started, including the appointment of new general management and initiation of an estimated $90 million restructuring program to improve field efficiency, operations and consolidate certain administrative functions. We incurred charges of $69 million related to this restructuring program in 2007 which negatively impacted operating margins. Attrition rates for customers in our ADT Worldwide business continued to improve, declining to an average of 12.3% on a trailing 12 month basis for 2007, as compared to 14.2% for 2006 and 15.0% in 2005. As a result of our ongoing review of attrition rates and other pertinent factors affecting the related patterns in which revenues are expected to be earned, management reassessed amortization and depreciation methods and lives for its company owned security systems and dealer intangible assets and made adjustments in 2007 (see Note 1). Operating income of $842 million in 2007 decreased $65 million from $907 million in 2006. Factors that positively impacted operating income included increased volume, operational efficiencies and reductions to depreciation and amortization expense, of $26 million. The decrease to depreciation and amortization expense resulted from changes to the depreciation method and estimated useful lives for pooled subscriber assets and changes to the estimated useful lives of dealer intangible assets. These increases were more than offset by a goodwill impairment charge of $46 million, due to the reorganization of our management and segment reporting structure, as well as increased investment in selling and marketing in Americas and Asia. In addition, results for 2007 included net restructuring and asset impairment charges of $83 million, which were primarily related to actions to improve field efficiencies and consolidating certain administrative functions in Europe, and an impairment of certain indefinite lived intangible assets. Net restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges were $5 million in 2006. During the fourth quarter of 2007, ADT Worldwide began converting certain North American customers to digital backup services in advance of the February 2008 analog to digital signal transition for wireless cellular carriers. Given the Companys experience with this conversion in the fourth quarter, we estimate that the cost of the conversion will negatively impact operating income by approximate $40 million to $50 million in the first half of 2008. Net revenue for ADT Worldwide increased 1.4% during 2006, with product revenue up 3.0% compared to 2005. Revenue grew 10.6% in the Rest of World geographies, driven primarily by strong growth in Asia and Latin America. Revenue in North America was up slightly, while revenue in the EMEA region declined due to the continued high attrition of the legacy account base in Continental Europe. Net revenue was unfavorably affected by $35 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates while the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures unfavorably impacted net revenue by $19 million. Operating income decreased $45 million in 2006 from 2005. Results for 2006 included net restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges of $5 million as compared to net restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges of $13 million in 2005. Operating income for 2006 was negatively affected by slightly lower gross margin, due largely to margin pressures in commercial contracting coupled with a slightly higher mix of lower margin contracting revenue. These effects were partially offset by cost savings related to operational excellence initiatives. In addition, 2006 was unfavorably affected by incremental stock option charges of $14 million required under SFAS No. 123R. 55 Fire Protection Services Net revenue, operating income and operating margin for Fire Protection Services for the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005 were as follows ($ in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Revenue from product sales $ 1,901 $ 1,729 $ 1,626 Service revenue 1,605 1,552 1,556 Net revenue $ 3,506 $ 3,281 $ 3,182 Operating income $ 253 $ 239 $ 202 Operating margin 7.2 % 7.3 % 6.3 % Net revenue for Fire Protection Services increased $225 million, or 6.9%, during 2007 as compared to 2006, driven largely by a 9.9% increase in revenue from product sales. Revenue from product sales includes sales and installation of fire protection and other systems. Service revenue comprises inspection, maintenance, service and monitoring of fire detection and suppression systems. This increase was largely the result of strong growth in most regions which benefited from continuing strength in commercial construction activity in our focused end markets. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact of $99 million while divestitures had a negative impact of $30 million. Operating income increased $14 million during 2007 as compared to 2006 resulting largely from increased volume, and improved margins, primarily in North America. Results for 2007 included net restructuring charges of $33 million, of which $1 million is included in cost of sales, primarily related to actions to improve field efficiencies and consolidate certain administrative functions in Europe, compared to no charges 2006. Net revenue for Fire Protection Services increased $99 million, or 3.1%, during 2006 as compared to 2005, driven largely by a 6.3% increase in revenue from product sales. Most of the revenue increase occurred in North America, which experienced strong bookings and increasing backlog throughout most of the past two years. Revenue was unfavorably affected by $39 million related to divestitures and $22 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Operating income increased $37 million in 2006 over 2005. Higher revenue, slightly improved gross margin and continued control of general and administrative expenses contributed to the improved operating results. Operating income for 2006 was also favorably affected by cost savings related to operational excellence initiatives and prior year restructuring programs. In addition, 2006 was unfavorably affected by incremental stock option charges of $8 million required under SFAS No. 123R. Flow Control Net revenue, operating income and operating margin for Flow Control for the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005 were as follows ($ in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Revenue from product sales $ 3,618 $ 3,002 $ 2,690 Service revenue 148 133 116 Net revenue $ 3,766 $ 3,135 $ 2,806 Operating income $ 457 $ 356 $ 336 Operating margin 12.1 % 11.4 % 12.0 % Net revenue for Flow Control increased $631 million, or 20.1%, in 2007 as compared 2006. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by volume growth from continued strength in most industrial 56 end markets with significant project growth in the energy and water sectors. Growth in these sectors was strong across all geographical regions, and, in particular, Asia Pacific and Europe. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted revenue by $197 million while the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures unfavorably impacted net revenue by $16 million. The increase in operating income of $101 million, or 28.4%, in 2007 as compared 2006 was primarily due to revenue growth, as well as improved utilization rates. The increase in operating income during 2007 was partially offset by net restructuring and asset impairment charges of $25 million, which includes $6 million in cost of sales, $3 million of divestiture charges, and $1 million of Separation costs. Net revenue for Flow Control increased $329 million, or 11.7%, in 2006 as compared to 2005. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by volume growth from strength in most industrial end markets with substantial project growth in the energy, process and water sectors. Growth in these sectors was particularly strong in Asia Pacific and the Americas. The increases in revenue were partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $43 million. The increase in operating income in 2006 as compared to 2005 was due primarily to revenue growth mentioned above, along with the impact of operational excellence initiatives. This increase was partially offset by the impact of incremental stock option charges required under SFAS No. 123R of $7 million. Safety Products Net revenue, operating income and operating margin for Safety Products for the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005 were as follows ($ in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Revenue from product sales $ 1,752 $ 1,660 $ 1,668 Service revenue 15 15 14 Net revenue $ 1,767 $ 1,675 $ 1,682 Operating income $ 286 $ 202 $ 278 Operating margin 16.2 % 12.1 % 16.5 % Net revenue for Safety Products increased $92 million, or 5.5%, during 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily from strong performance in the fire suppression and electronic security businesses. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $48 million also contributed to the increase in revenue. The increase in the fire suppression business was driven by continued growth in the energy and marine sectors in the Americas and the Middle East as well as increased selling prices to help offset the significant cost increase of raw materials. The electronic security business also experienced favorable growth as a result of new product introductions and new market expansions. These increases were partially offset by continued softness in the life safety business in North America due to delays of federal assistance provided to fire departments. Operating income increased $84 million to $286 million for the year ended September 28, 2007 compared to the prior year. Prior year results included a $100 million charge related to a pre existing Voluntary Replacement Program ("VRP") for sprinkler heads in the fire suppression business. The deadline for filing claims to participate in the VRP ended on August 31, 2007. In light of the most current claims data, an additional $10 million charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007. Net revenue for Safety Products decreased $7 million during 2006 as compared to 2005 driven by the unfavorable impact of $56 million from divested businesses as well as delays of federal assistance provided to fire departments which unfavorably impacted the life safety business. These decreases were 57 partially offset by stronger performance in the fire suppression business as a result of favorable market conditions in the United States, Middle East and China and new product introductions, including clean agent fire suppression systems. The electronic security business also experienced favorable growth as a result of new product introductions and new market expansions. Foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted revenues by $7 million. Operating income decreased $76 million in 2006 over 2005 primarily as a result of a $100 million charge related to a pre existing voluntary replacement program for sprinkler heads in the fire suppression business. This charge reflected our updated estimate of the additional costs necessary to bring the program to completion. The decrease in operating income during 2006 was partially offset by volume growth and higher margins from new product introductions and price increases in the fire suppression and electronic security business, as well as cost reduction benefits from the 2004 restructuring programs. Also, 2006 results include the effect of incremental stock option charges required under SFAS No. 123R of $5 million. Electrical and Metal Products Net revenue, operating income and operating margin for Electrical and Metal Products for the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005 were as follows ($ in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Revenue from product sales $ 1,970 $ 1,946 $ 1,795 Service revenue 4 3 3 Net revenue $ 1,974 $ 1,949 $ 1,798 Operating income $ 159 $ 319 $ 295 Operating margin 8.1 % 16.4 % 16.4 % Net revenue for Electrical and Metal Products increased $25 million, or 1.3%, in 2007 as compared to 2006. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $20 million contributed to the increase in revenue. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by increased sales volume of armored cable products, steel tubular products, and higher selling prices and sales volumes in Brazil. These increases were largely offset by the impact of lower selling prices on steel tubular products in North America. The decrease in operating income of $160 million, or 50.2%, in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to unfavorable spreads on both steel tubular and armored cable products. Income generated by higher sales volume for both armored cable and steel tubular products were more than offset by lower selling prices and higher raw material prices. Net revenue for Electrical and Metal Products increased $151 million, or 8.4%, in 2006 as compared to 2005. The increase in net revenue in 2006 was largely driven by increased selling prices of armored cable products as a result of higher costs of copper and higher volumes of core steel products due to growth in the non residential construction markets in North America. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $15 million also contributed to the increase in revenue. The above increases in revenue were partially offset by the impact of lower selling prices on core steel products in North America mainly due to lower costs of steel and a slower market for products in Brazil. The increase in operating income of $24 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 was due primarily to favorable copper spreads and higher volumes of core steel products. These increases were partially offset by the impact of reduced spreads for core steel products and incremental stock option charges required under SFAS No. 123R of $3 million. 58  Corporate and Other Net revenue, operating income and operating margin for Corporate and Other Metal Products for the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005 were as follows ($ in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Revenue from product sales $ 120 $ 91 $ 93 Service revenue Net revenue $ 120 $ 91 $ 93 Operations $ 24 $ 18 $ 18 Corporate expense (3,736 ) (671 ) (890 ) Operating loss $ (3,712 ) $ (653 ) $ (872 ) Corporate and Other includes the operating results of certain international buildings products businesses. Corporate expense for 2007 included class action settlement charge, net of $2.862 billion, Separation related costs of $104 million, and net restructuring charges of $40 million primarily related to the consolidation of certain headquarter functions. Additionally, corporate expense for 2007 includes $13 million of charges related to the accelerated amortization of restricted shares in connection with the Separation. In connection with the Separation, we have initiated actions to reduce our corporate expense and are targeting a full year corporate expense run rate of $500 million by mid 2008. Corporate expense in 2006 was $219 million lower than 2005. Corporate expense for 2006 included $72 million of income related to the extinguishment of certain payment obligations under a split dollar life insurance policy and rabbi trust pursuant to a settlement with Mr. Kozlowski, former Chief Executive Officer, and $48 million of income resulting from a reduction in our estimated workers compensation liabilities primarily due to favorable claims experience. These income items were partially offset by incremental stock option charges of $47 million required under SFAS 123R, Separation related costs of $49 million and restructuring and divestiture charges of $2 million. On a comparative basis to 2005, corporate expense in 2006 also benefited from lower Sarbanes Oxley compliance costs. Corporate expense for 2005 included a $50 million charge for fines and penalties paid to resolve the matters raised in the SEC investigation that commenced in June 2002, as well as a $70 million charge for estimated contingencies related to contested legal proceedings seeking to enforce retention agreements for five former executives. Interest Income and Expense Interest income was $102 million in 2007, as compared to $43 million and $39 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in interest income in 2007 is primarily related to interest earned on the class action settlement escrow of $41 million. Interest expense was $313 million in 2007, as compared to $279 million in 2006 and $322 million in 2005. The increase in interest expense in 2007 is a result of interest on the class action settlement liability of $41 million, partially offset by lower debt outstanding. The decrease in interest expense in 2006 is primarily driven by lower debt balances, partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates on our interest rate swap program as compared to 2005. The weighted average interest rate on total debt outstanding at September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005 were 6.3%, 6.0% and 5.7%, respectively. 59 In each period, net interest amounts were proportionally allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics based on the debt amounts that we believe were utilized by Covidien and Tyco Electronics historically inclusive of amounts directly incurred and is reflected as discontinued operations. Allocated net interest was calculated using our historical weighted average interest rate on debt, including the impact of interest rate swap agreements. The portion of Tycos interest income allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics was $35 million, $53 million and $43 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The portion of Tycos interest expense allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics was $242 million, $378 million and $433 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Other Expense, Net Other expense, net was $255 million in 2007 and $296 million in 2005. During 2007, other expense, net consisted primarily of a $259 million loss on early extinguishment of debt incurred in connection with the debt tender offers (see Note 13), for which no tax benefit is available. This charge consists primarily of premiums paid and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts. The total loss on early extinguishment of debt was $647 million, with $259 million included in continuing operations and $388 million allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics and included in discontinued operations. During 2005, other expense, net consisted primarily of losses related to the repurchase of outstanding convertible debt prior to its scheduled maturity partially offset by a $109 million court ordered restitution award. During 2005, the Company repurchased $1,241 million principal amount of its outstanding 2.75% convertible senior debentures for $1,823 million and $750 million principal amount of its outstanding 3.125% convertible senior debentures for $1,147 million. These repurchases resulted in a $1,013 million loss on the retirement of debt, including the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs, with $405 included in continuing operations and $608 million allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics and included in discontinued operations. Additionally, in September 2005, we were awarded a total of $134 million as restitution in connection with our litigation against Mr. L. Dennis Kozlowski, our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Mark H. Swartz, our former Chief Financial Officer and Director (together, the "Defendants"), as described in Item 3. Legal Proceedings. The restitution award is comprised of $109 million of previously expensed compensation made to the Defendants and reported as other expense, net in prior years and $25 million related to a loan receivable from Mr. L. Dennis Kozlowski which had been reflected in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements as a receivable. During 2007, the Company received payment for these amounts. Income Taxes Effective Income Tax Rate The effective tax rate for 2007 is not meaningful primarily as a result of the class action settlement charge, net of $2.862 billion and the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $259 million for which no tax benefit is available. Additionally, taxes for 2007 were negatively impacted by tax costs related to the Separation. Our effective income tax rate was 27.3% and 4.7% for 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate from 2005 to 2006 was primarily the result of a lower release of deferred tax asset valuation allowances, increased profits in higher tax rate jurisdictions and adjustments to the tax accrual for legacy tax matters in 2005, partially offset by the loss on retirement of debt for which no benefit was available in 2005. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $666 million and $800 million at September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of 60 certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," which requires a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is "more likely than not" that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by these taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as payment is not expected within one year. Other Income Tax Matters In connection with the spin offs of Covidien and Tyco Electronics from Tyco, Tyco entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that generally governs Covidiens, Tyco Electronics and Tycos respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations after the distribution with respect to taxes, including ordinary course of business taxes and taxes, if any, incurred as a result of any failure of the distribution of all of the shares of Covidien or Tyco Electronics to qualify as a tax free distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 355 of the Code or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin offs to qualify for tax favored treatment under the Code. Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, with certain exceptions, Tyco generally is responsible for the payment of 27% of any additional U.S. income taxes that are required to be paid to a U.S. tax authority as a result of a U.S. tax audit of Covidiens, Tyco Electronics or Tycos subsidiaries income tax returns for all periods prior to the spin offs. Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, the Company shares responsibility for certain of Tycos, Covidiens and Tyco Electronics income tax liabilities based on a sharing formula for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. More specifically, Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics share 27%, 42% and 31%, respectively, of U.S. income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to Tycos, Covidiens and Tyco Electronics U.S. income tax returns. All costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are shared equally among the parties. At September 28, 2007, Tyco has recorded a receivable from Covidien and Tyco Electronics of $103 million reflected in other assets as our estimate of their portion of the Tax Sharing obligations with an offset to shareholders equity. Other liabilities include $543 million for the fair value of Tycos obligations under the Tax Sharing Agreement, determined in accordance with FIN 45 recognized with an offset to shareholders equity. Tyco will provide payment under the Tax Sharing Agreement as the shared income tax liabilities are settled. Settlement is expected to occur as the IRS audit process is completed for the impacted years. Given the nature of the shared liabilities, the maximum amount of potential future payments is not determinable. In the event the Separation is determined to be taxable and such determination was the result of actions taken after the Separation by Tyco, Covidien or Tyco Electronics, the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on Tyco, Covidien or Tyco Electronics as a result 61 thereof. If such determination is not the result of actions taken after the Separation by Tyco, Covidien or Tyco Electronics, then Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics would be responsible for 27%, 42% and 31%, respectively, of any taxes imposed on Tyco, Covidien or Tyco Electronics as a result of such determination. Such tax amounts could be significant. The Company is responsible for all of its own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreements sharing formula. In addition, Covidien and Tyco Electronics are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the Tax Sharing Agreements sharing formula. If any party to the Tax Sharing Agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no partys fault, each non defaulting party would be required to pay, equally with any other non defaulting party, the amounts in default. In addition, if another party to the Tax Sharing Agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority, the Company could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, the Company may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of its agreed upon share of Tycos, Covidiens and Tyco Electronics tax liabilities. See Note 16 for further discussion of guarantees and indemnifications extended among Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics. The Company and its subsidiaries income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. The Company is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest that management has assessed as probable and estimable have been recorded. In 2004, in connection with the IRS audit of the 1997 through 2000 years, the Company submitted to the IRS proposed adjustments to these prior period U.S. federal income tax returns resulting in a reduction in the taxable income previously filed. During 2006, the IRS accepted substantially all of the proposed adjustments. Also during 2006, the Company developed proposed amendments to U.S. federal income tax returns for additional periods through 2002. On the basis of previously accepted amendments, the Company has determined that acceptance of these adjustments is probable and, accordingly, has recorded them in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such adjustments did not have a material impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The Company has yet to complete proposed amendments to its U.S. federal income tax returns for periods subsequent to 2002, which will primarily reflect the roll forward through 2006 of the amendments for the periods 1997 to 2002. When the Companys tax return positions are updated additional adjustments may be identified and recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. While the final adjustments cannot be determined until the income tax return amendment process is completed, the Company believes that any resulting adjustments will not have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. During the third quarter of 2007, the IRS concluded its field examination of certain of Tycos U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 though 2000 and issued anticipated Revenue Agents Reports ("RARs") which reflect the IRS determination of proposed tax adjustments for the periods under audit. The RARs propose tax audit adjustments to certain of the Companys previously filed tax return positions, all of which the Company expected and previously assessed at each balance sheet date. Accordingly, the Company has made no additional provision during the year ended September 28, 2007 as a result of the proposed audit adjustments in the RARs. The Company has agreed with the IRS on adjustments totaling $498 million, with an estimated cash impact to the Company of $458 million, and during the third quarter of 2007, the Company paid $458 million, of which $163 million relates to the Companys discontinued operations. The Company 62 appealed other proposed tax audit adjustments totaling approximately $1 billion, and, as Audit Managing Party as specified in the Tax Sharing Agreement, the Company intends to vigorously defend its prior filed tax return positions. The Company continues to believe that the amounts recorded in its financial statements relating to these tax adjustments are sufficient. However, the ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain and could result in a material impact to the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, ultimate resolution of these matters could result in the Company filing amended U.S. federal income tax returns for years subsequent to the current 1997 to 2000 audit period and could have a material impact on the Companys effective tax rate in future reporting periods. Additionally, the IRS proposed civil fraud penalties against a prior subsidiary that was distributed to Tyco Electronics arising from alleged actions of former executives in connection with certain intercompany transfers of stock of Simplex Technologies in 1998 and 1999. Based on statutory guidelines, we estimate the proposed penalties could range between $30 million and $50 million. The Company as Audit Managing Party will vigorously oppose the assertion of such penalties against Tyco Electronics, in part, because beginning in 2003 the Company discovered, investigated and reported the conduct at issue to the IRS and fully cooperated in the criminal prosecution of the Companys former Chief Tax Officer on a charge of willful filing of a false tax return. Except for earnings that are currently distributed, no additional material provision has been made for U.S. or non U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or the Company has concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of distribution of such earnings. A liability could arise if amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries. Discontinued Operations and Divestitures Discontinued Operations During the third quarter of 2007, Tyco completed the Separation and has presented its Healthcare and Electronics businesses as discontinued operations in all periods presented. The Company has used available information to develop its best estimates for certain assets and liabilities related to the Separation. In limited instances, final determination of the balances will be made in subsequent periods. During the fourth quarter of 2007, $72 million was recorded through shareholders equity, primarily related to the cash true up adjustment and other items, as specified in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, adjustments to certain pre Separation tax liabilities, and the impact of filing final income tax returns in certain jurisdictions where those returns include a combination of Tyco, Covidien and or Tyco Electronics legal entities. Additional adjustments are not expected to be material and will be recorded through shareholders equity in subsequent periods as tax returns are finalized. During 2007, AIJ, a joint venture that was majority owned by Infrastructure Services, was sold for $42 million in net cash proceeds and a pre tax gain on sale of $19 million was recorded. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2007, the remaining portion of Infrastructure Services met the held for sale criteria and its results of operations have been included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. Infrastructure Services provides consulting, engineering, construction management and operating services for the water, wastewater, environmental, transportation and facilities market. The Company has assessed the recoverability of these businesses carrying values and will continue to assess recoverability based on current fair value, less cost to sell, until the businesses are sold. On September 17, 2007, the Company executed a definitive agreement to sell for approximately 63 $295 million in cash 100% of the stock of ETEO Empresa de Transmissao de Energia do Oeste Ltda., a Brazilian subsidiary of Infrastructure Services. The transaction is subject to Brazilian regulatory approval and normal closing conditions and is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2008. The Company expects to sell the remaining portion of Infrastructure Services by the end of fiscal 2008. The AIJ, Infrastructure Services, Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products and A&E Products businesses met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and have been included in discontinued operations in all periods presented. Losses on divestitures During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company recorded $4 million, $2 million and $23 million, respectively, of divestiture charges in continuing operations in connection with the write down to fair value, less cost to sell, of certain businesses. The fair value used for the impairment assessments was primarily based on the terms and conditions included or expected to be included in the sales agreements. Acquisitions During 2007, cash paid for acquisitions included in continuing operations, primarily within ADT Worldwide, Safety Products and Flow Control, totaled $31 million. Cash paid for acquisitions by businesses included in continuing operations during 2006 and 2005 totaled $5 million and $6 million, respectively. These acquisitions were funded utilizing cash from operations. The results of operations of the acquired companies have been included in Tycos consolidated results from the respective acquisition dates. These acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Goodwill Impairment In connection with the Separation, during the third quarter of 2007 Tyco reorganized into a new management and segment reporting structure. As part of these organizational changes, the Company assessed new reporting units and conducted valuations to determine the assignment of goodwill to the new reporting units based on their estimated relative fair values. Following the relative fair value goodwill allocation, the Company then tested goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded its fair value, goodwill was considered potentially impaired. Where goodwill was potentially impaired, the Company compared the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill to the carrying amount of that goodwill. The carrying amount of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill in the Australia and New Zealand Security Services business, part of the ADT Worldwide segment. As a result, the Company recognized a goodwill impairment of $46 million in the third quarter of 2007. In determining fair value, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgments in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. Changes to these factors and judgments could result in impairment to one or more of our reporting units in a future period. See Note 1. 64  Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change During 2006, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation ("FIN") No. 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143." FIN No. 47 clarifies the timing of liability recognition for legal obligations associated with an asset retirement when the timing and (or) method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity and clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. FIN No. 47 requires that conditional asset retirement obligations, along with the associated capitalized asset retirement costs, be initially reported at their fair values. Upon adoption, the Company recognized a liability of $32 million for asset retirement obligations and an increase of $10 million in the carrying amount of the related assets, of which $19 million and $5 million are reflected in liabilities and assets of discontinued operations, respectively. The initial recognition resulted in a cumulative effect of accounting change of $14 million after tax loss ($22 million pre tax), reflecting the accumulated depreciation and accretion that would have been recognized in prior periods had the provisions of FIN No. 47 been in effect at the time. During 2005, the Company changed the measurement date for its pension and postretirement benefit plans, from September 30th to August 31st, effective October 1, 2004. The Company believes that the one month change of measurement date is a preferable change as it allows management adequate time to evaluate and report the actuarial information in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements under the accelerated reporting deadlines. As a result of this change, the Company recorded a $21 million after tax gain ($28 million pre tax) cumulative effect of accounting change. 65  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. Depreciation and Amortization Methods for Security Monitoring Related Assets Tyco generally considers assets related to the acquisition of new customers in its electronic security business in three asset categories: internally generated residential subscriber systems, internally generated commercial subscriber systems (collectively referred to as subscriber system assets) and customer accounts acquired through the ADT dealer program (referred to as dealer intangibles). Subscriber system assets include installed property, plant and equipment for which Tyco retains ownership and deferred costs directly related to the customer acquisition and system installation. Subscriber system assets and any deferred revenue resulting from the customer acquisition are accounted for over the expected life of the subscriber. In certain geographical areas where the Company has a large number of customers that behave in a similar manner over time, the Company accounts for subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue using pools, with separate pools for the components of subscriber system assets and any related deferred revenue based on the month and year of acquisition. Effective as of the beginning of the third quarter of 2007, Tyco changed the depreciation method and estimated useful life used to account for pooled subscriber system assets (primarily in North America) and related deferred revenue from the straight line method with lives ranging from 10 to 14 years to an accelerated method with lives up to 15 years. The accelerated method utilizes declining balance rates based on geographical area ranging from 160% to 195% for residential subscriber pools and 145% to 265% for commercial subscriber pools and converts to a straight line methodology when the resulting depreciation charge is greater than that from the accelerated method. The Company will continue to use a straight line method with a 14 year life for non pooled subscriber system assets (primarily in Europe and Asia) and related deferred revenue, with remaining balances written off upon customer termination. The change in the method and estimated useful life used to account for pooled subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue resulted from our ongoing analysis of all pertinent factors, including actual customer attrition data specific to customer categories and geographical areas, demand, competition, and the estimated technological life of the installed systems. The pertinent factors have been influenced by managements ongoing customer retention programs, as well as tactical and strategic initiatives to improve service delivery, customer satisfaction, and the credit worthiness of the subscriber customer base. All pertinent factors, including actual customer attrition data specific to customer categories and geographical areas, demand, competition, and the estimated technological life of the installed systems, will continue to be reviewed by the Company at each balance sheet date to assess the continued appropriateness of methods and estimated useful lives. Effective as of the beginning of the third quarter of 2007, Tyco also changed the estimated useful life of dealer intangibles in geographical areas comprising approximately 90% of the net carrying value of dealer intangibles from 12 to 15 years. The Company continues to amortize dealer intangible assets on an accelerated basis. The change in the estimated useful life used to account for dealer intangibles resulted from our ongoing analysis of all pertinent factors, including actual customer attrition data, demand, competition, and the estimated technological life of the installed systems. The pertinent factors have been influenced by managements ongoing customer retention programs, as well as tactical and strategic initiatives to improve service delivery, customer satisfaction, and the credit worthiness of the subscriber customer base. 66 Attrition rates for customers in our ADT Worldwide business were 12.3%, 14.2% and 15.0% on a trailing 12 month basis for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Revenue Recognition Contract sales for the installation of fire protection systems, large security intruder systems and other construction related projects are recorded primarily under the percentage of completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related total cost of the project at completion. The risk of this methodology is its dependence upon estimates of costs at completion, which are subject to the uncertainties inherent in long term contracts. Revisions to cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits each period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they become determinable. If estimates are inaccurate, there is risk that our revenue and profits for the period may be overstated or understated. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other markets participants. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience and trend analysis. Loss Contingencies Accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings, self insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on judgment, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates. Additionally, the Company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. Income Taxes In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and international pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction. Any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. If a change in a valuation allowance occurs, which was established in connection with an acquisition, such adjustment may impact goodwill rather than the income tax provision. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these reserves 67 in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If the tax liabilities relate to tax uncertainties existing at the date of the acquisition of a business, the adjustment of such tax liabilities will result in an adjustment to the goodwill recorded at the date of acquisition. Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually and more frequently if triggering events occur. In performing these assessments, management relies on various factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable transactions and other market data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment. Since judgment is involved in performing fair value measurements used in goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets impairment analyses, there is risk that the carrying values of our goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets may be overstated. We elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for all goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. When testing for goodwill impairment, the Company follows the guidance prescribed in SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." First, the Company compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered potentially impaired and further tests are performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. In the second step of the goodwill impairment test, the Company compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. The Company allocates the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill. Disruptions to our business such as end market conditions and protracted economic weakness, unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units, the divestiture of a significant component of a reporting unit and market capitalization declines may result in our having to perform a goodwill impairment first step valuation analysis for some or all of our reporting units prior to the required annual assessment. These types of events and the resulting analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future. Goodwill impairments related to continuing operations were $46 million during 2007. There were no goodwill impairments related to continuing operations during 2006 and 2005. Long Lived Assets Assets held and used by the Company, including property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. Tyco performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if impairment exists. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, Tyco groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identified. If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Impairments to long lived assets to be disposed of are recorded based upon the fair value of the applicable assets. The calculation of the fair value of long lived assets is based on assumptions concerning the amount and 68 timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of long lived assets, there is a risk that the carrying value of our long lived assets may be overstated or understated. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations. Two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions. The discount rate represents the market rate for high quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our present value of pension obligations by approximately $90 million. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected long term rates of return on those types of plan assets, in determining the expected long term return on plan assets. A 50 basis point decrease in the expected long term return on plan assets would increase our pension expense by approximately $10 million.  Liquidity and Capital Resources The sources of our cash flow from operating activities and the use of a portion of that cash in our operations for the years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005 were as follows ($ in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Cash flows from operating activities: Operating (loss) income $ (1,715 ) $ 1,370 $ 1,191 Goodwill impairment 46 Non cash restructuring and asset impairment charges, net 24 2 2 Losses on divestitures 4 2 23 Depreciation and amortization(1) 1,151 1,182 1,204 Non cash compensation expense 173 151 72 Deferred income taxes (11 ) (414 ) (227 ) Provision for losses on accounts receivable and inventory 94 56 102 Other, net(2) 28 (36 ) 147 Class action settlement liability 2,992 Net change in working capital (405 ) 226 125 Interest income 102 43 39 Interest expense (313 ) (279 ) (322 ) Income tax expense (334 ) (310 ) (29 ) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,836 $ 1,993 $ 2,327 Other cash flow items: Capital expenditures, net(3) $ (646 ) $ (519 ) $ (463 ) Decrease in sale of accounts receivable 7 8 8 Acquisition of customer accounts (ADT dealer program) (409 ) (373 ) (328 ) Purchase accounting and holdback liabilities (10 ) (7 ) (14 ) Voluntary pension contributions 23 83 (1)Includes depreciation expense of $638 million, $665 million and $676 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and amortization of intangible assets of $513 million, $517 million and $528 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. (2)Includes the add back of losses on the retirement of debt of $259 million, $1 million and $405 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. (3)Includes net proceeds of $23 million, $39 million and $53 million received for the sale/disposition of property, plant and equipment in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 69  The net change in total working capital was a cash decrease of $405 million in 2007. The components of this change are set forth in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The significant changes in working capital included a $166 million increase in inventories, a $128 million increase in accounts receivable, and $244 million of changes in income taxes, net, which includes a payment of legacy tax liabilities. Additionally, working capital includes the collection of $38 million related to restitution owed by Mark H. Swartz, former Chief Financial Officer and Director, and $98 million related to the restitution owed by L. Dennis Kozlowski, former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. During the third quarter of 2007, Tyco entered into the class action settlement and borrowed under its unsecured bridge loan and revolving credit facilities to fund the $2.992 billion liability, placing the proceeds in escrow for the benefit of the class. During 2007, we completed the sale of the AIJ business for $42 million in net cash proceeds. Additionally, during 2007, we received $271 million due to the liquidation of investments in a rabbi trust, as well as $136 million in restitution payments owed by former executives as described above. We continue to fund capital expenditures to improve the cost structure of our businesses, to invest in new processes and technology, and to maintain high quality production standards. Capital spending increased to $669 million in 2007 from $558 million in 2006. The level of capital expenditures in 2008 is expected to exceed spending levels in 2007 and is also expected to exceed depreciation. In September 2007, Tycos Board of Directors approved a new $1.0 billion share repurchase program under which, we repurchased 1.3 million common shares for $56 million. During the first quarter of 2007 we repurchased 5 million common shares for $659 million completing the $2.0 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in May 2006. This followed the repurchase of 13 million common shares for $1.3 billion in 2006. Additionally during 2006, we completed the $1.5 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in July of 2005 with the repurchase of 11 million common shares for $1.2 billion. In 2006, we commenced the termination of our interest rate and cross currency swaps, which were designated as fair value hedges. During 2007, we terminated the remaining swaps. Such terminations resulted in a net cash inflow of $63 million. During the first quarter of 2007, we launched a $350 million to $400 million company wide restructuring program. During 2007, 2006 and 2005 we paid out $70 million, $32 million and $103 million, respectively, in cash related to restructuring activities. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our restructuring activities. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, related to continuing operations was $650 million in 2007, which included $295 million of legacy tax liability payments of amounts not yet due to the IRS in respect of their examination of our 1997 through 2000 U.S. federal income tax returns (the ultimate resolution of which is uncertain). During 2007, 2006 and 2005, Tyco paid $409 million, $373 million and $328 million of cash, respectively, to acquire approximately 415,000, 401,000 and 364,000 customer contracts for electronic security services through the ADT dealer program. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we paid $10 million, $7 million and $14 million, respectively, in cash for purchase accounting and holdback liabilities. Holdback liabilities represent a portion of the purchase price withheld from the seller pending finalization of the acquisition balance sheet and other contingencies. At September 28, 2007 holdback liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets were $16 million, which are included in other liabilities. At September 28, 2007, $14 million of acquisition liabilities remained on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, of which $4 million are included in accrued and other current liabilities and $10 million are included in other liabilities. 70 As previously discussed, effective June 29, 2007, the Company completed the Separation. In connection with the Separation, we paid $349 million in Separation costs during 2007 and $96 million in 2006, including $256 million and $77 million, respectively, recorded in cash provided by discontinued operating activities. We expect that we will incur the remaining cash outflows related to the Separation during the first six months of fiscal 2008. These amounts will primarily consist of tax restructuring, professional services and employee related costs. Capitalization Shareholders equity was $15.6 billion or $31.50 per share, at September 28, 2007, compared to $35.4 billion or $71.06 per share, at September 29, 2006. Shareholders equity decreased $19.8 billion primarily due to the distribution of Covidien and Tyco Electronics to shareholders. This decrease was also due to net loss of $1.7 billion, the repurchase of common shares by a subsidiary of $727 million, and dividends declared of $668 million, offset by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $883 million. In connection with the Separation, as approved by our Board of Directors, we executed a reverse stock split, and as a result, four Tyco shares were converted into one share. Shareholder approval was obtained at the March 8, 2007 Special General Meeting of Shareholders. Our debt levels decreased significantly as compared to September 29, 2006 primarily due to the debt tenders and Covidien and Tyco Electronics assuming their portion of related borrowings. At September 28, 2007, total debt decreased $5.1 billion to $4.5 billion, as compared to $9.6 billion at September 29, 2006. Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization (total debt and shareholders equity) was 22% at September 28, 2007, which increased slightly as compared to 21% at September 29, 2006 due to the decrease in shareholders equity mentioned above. See Debt Tenders and Bank and Revolving Credit Facilities below for further discussion. Our cash balance decreased to $1.9 billion at September 28, 2007, as compared to $2.2 billion at September 29, 2006. The decrease in cash was primarily due to the debt repayments referred to above and the class action settlement escrow. These decreases were partially offset by cash flows provided by operations and transfers from discontinued operations. As previously discussed, in September 2007, the Board of Directors approved a new $1.0 billion share repurchase program. Pursuant to the program, we may repurchase Tyco shares from time to time in open market purchases at prevailing market prices, in negotiated transactions off the market, or pursuant to an approved 10b5 1 trading plan in accordance with applicable regulations. A Rule 10b5 1 trading plan permits the Company to repurchase its shares during periods when the Company would not normally be active in the trading market due to insider trading laws, provided the plan is adopted when the Company is not aware of material non public information. Under a Rule 10b5 1 trading plan, we would be unable to repurchase shares above a pre determined price per share. Additionally, the maximum number of shares that we may purchase each day would be governed by Rule 10b 18. Dividend payments were $791 million in 2007. On September 13, 2007 Tycos Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend on the Companys common shares of $0.15 per share payable on November 1, 2007 to shareholders of record of Tyco International Ltd. post Separation on October 1, 2007. The timing, declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common shares, however, falls within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including the statutory requirements of Bermuda law, our financial condition and results of operations, the capital requirements of our businesses, industry practice and any other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant. 71 Debt Tenders On April 27, 2007, we announced that, in connection with the Separation, we and certain of our subsidiaries that are issuers of our corporate debt had commenced tender offers to purchase for cash substantially all of our outstanding U.S. dollar denominated public debt, aggregating approximately $6.6 billion. Of this amount, approximately $5.9 billion was non convertible U.S. debt and $750 million was convertible U.S. debt, with maturities from 2007 to 2029. In conjunction with the tender offers, the relevant issuer solicited consents for certain clarifying amendments to the indentures pursuant to which the debt was issued. We received acceptance notices for approximately $2.1 billion, or 36% of our outstanding non convertible U.S. debt and approximately $726 million or 97% of our outstanding convertible U.S. debt. Debt which was not tendered in an amount of approximately $3.8 billion remains with us. Additionally, Tyco International Group S.A., our wholly owned subsidiary organized under the laws of Luxembourg ("TIGSA"), commenced on April 30, 2007 tender offers to purchase for cash all of its outstanding Euro and Pound Sterling denominated public debt, aggregating the equivalent of approximately $1.9 billion, with maturities from 2008 to 2031, issued under its Euro Medium Term Note Programme (the "EMTN Notes") and a consent solicitation for certain clarifying amendments to the fiscal agency agreement pursuant to which the EMTN Notes were issued. We received acceptance notices for approximately $1.5 billion, or 80% of our EMTN Notes. The remaining EMTN Notes were repurchased pursuant to an optional redemption. In connection with the debt tender offers, we incurred a pre tax charge for the early extinguishment of debt of approximately $647 million, for which no tax benefit is available (see Note 5). TIGSAs remaining debt was contributed to Tyco International Finance S.A. ("TIFSA"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and successor company to TIGSA. Bank and Revolving Credit Facilities On April 25, 2007, we, certain of our subsidiaries and a syndicate of banks entered into three 364 day unsecured bridge loan facilities with an aggregate commitment amount of $10 billion. At the end of May 2007, the aggregate commitment amount under these facilities was increased to $12.5 billion. We borrowed approximately $8.9 billion under the unsecured bridge loan facilities to fund our debt tender offers, repay our existing bank credit facilities and to finance the class action settlement. Of this amount, approximately $4.3 billion and $3.6 billion was assigned to Covidien and Tyco Electronics, respectively. We initially guaranteed the new unsecured bridge loan facilities and Covidien and Tyco Electronics each assumed Tycos obligations with respect to their unsecured bridge loan facilities upon the Separation. We no longer guarantee those assumed amounts. This facility has a variable interest rate based on LIBOR. The margin over LIBOR payable by TIFSA can vary based on changes in our credit rating. As of September 28, 2007, our aggregate commitment under our unsecured bridge loan facility was $4.0 billion and $367 million remained outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5%. On October 1, 2007, the commitments with respect to the unused portion of our unsecured bridge loan facility expired. Our unsecured revolving credit facility described below and our letter of credit facility described in Commitments and Contingencies Contractual Obligations, provide the lenders under those facilities with the right to demand repayment of outstanding amounts, and to terminate commitments to extend additional credit, if (i) certain of our outstanding public debt is declared due and payable and (ii) we do not have sufficient liquidity available under our unsecured bridge loan facility to refinance such debt. As a result, on November 27, 2007, we secured additional firm commitments from certain of our lenders under the bridge loan facility. These additional commitments provide us with sufficient liquidity to repay the outstanding public debt with borrowings of up to 72 $4.0 billion. The additional commitments expire on, and any borrowings under the facility would mature on, November 25, 2008. The facility may only be used to repay, settle or otherwise extinguish the public debt described above, which is the subject of ongoing litigation between us and The Bank of New York. For more information regarding such litigation, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Indenture Trustee Litigation. Additionally, on April 25, 2007, we, certain of our subsidiaries and a syndicate of banks entered into three unsecured revolving credit facilities with an initial aggregate commitment amount of $2.5 billion that increased to $4.25 billion at the time of the Separation. Of the aggregate commitment amount of $4.25 billion, a $1.25 billion commitment is available to us, and a $1.5 billion commitment was available to each of Covidien and Tyco Electronics. We will use the revolving credit facilities for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes. We initially guaranteed the new revolving credit facilities and Covidien and Tyco Electronics each assumed our obligations with respect to their revolving credit facilities upon the Separation. We no longer guarantee those assumed amounts. At September 28, 2007, we have borrowed $308 million under our unsecured revolving credit facility. This facility has a variable interest rate based on LIBOR. The margin over LIBOR payable by TIFSA can vary based on changes in our credit rating. The unsecured revolving credit facilities replaced TIGSAs existing $1.0 billion 5 year revolving credit facility and $1.5 billion 3 year revolving bank credit facility, which were terminated by June 1, 2007 prior to their scheduled expiration dates of December 16, 2009 and December 21, 2007, respectively. On the date of termination, no amounts were borrowed under these facilities. TIFSAs bank credit agreements contain customary terms and conditions, and financial covenants that limit the ratio of our debt to our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and that limit our ability to incur subsidiary debt or grant liens on our property. Our indentures contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges, subsidiary debt and sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are considered restrictive to our business. We believe we are in compliance with all of our debt covenants. The Bank of New York, as indenture trustee under indentures dated as of June 9, 1998 and November 12, 2003, is contesting whether the Separation transactions were permitted under such indentures. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings Indenture Trustee Litigation. The following table details our long term debt ratings at September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006: 2007 2006 Moodys Baa1 Baa3 Standard & Poors BBB BBB+ Fitch BBB BBB+ The security ratings set forth above are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 73  Commitments and Contingencies Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations and commitments for principal debt, minimum lease payment obligations under non cancelable operating leases and other obligations at September 28, 2007 is as follows ($ in millions): 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Debt(1)(2) $ 372 $ 517 $ 1 $ 517 $ 1,158 $ 1,848 $ 4,413 Capital leases(1) 8 7 6 4 2 37 64 Operating leases 291 226 171 123 72 157 1,040 Purchase obligations(3) 114 7 3 124 Total contractual cash obligations(4) $ 785 $ 757 $ 181 $ 644 $ 1,232 $ 2,042 $ 5,641 (1)Excludes interest. (2)Excludes debt discount and swap activity. (3)Purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of good and services. (4)Other long term liabilities primarily consist of the following: pension and postretirement costs, income taxes, warranty and environmental liabilities and are excluded from this table. We are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type. The minimum required contributions to our pension plans are expected to be approximately $69 million in 2008 and we expect to pay $7 million in 2008 related to postretirement benefit plans. At September 28, 2007, TIFSA had unsecured credit facilities of $1.25 billion due April 25, 2012, of which approximately $0.9 billion was undrawn and available (see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, certain of the Companys operating subsidiaries have uncommitted overdraft and similar types of facilities, which total $55 million, of which $51 million was undrawn and available. These facilities expire at various dates through the year 2009, most of which are renewable and are established primarily within our international operations. On June 21, 2007, Tyco and TIFSA entered into a new $500 million letter of credit facility, with Citibank N.A. as administrative agent, expiring on December 15, 2007. The facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit, supported by a related line of credit facility. TIFSA may only borrow under the line of credit agreement to reimburse the bank for obligations with respect to letters of credit issued under this facility. The covenants under this facility are substantially similar to the covenants under the bridge loan and revolving credit facilities. TIFSA would pay interest on any outstanding borrowings at a variable interest rate, based on the banks base rate or the Eurodollar rate, as defined. As of September 28, 2007, letters of credit of $494 million have been issued under the $500 million credit facility and $6 million remains available for issuance. There were no amounts borrowed under this credit facility at September 28, 2007. On October 19, 2007, the facility was amended. The amendment extended the maturity date to June 15, 2008 and adjusted the interest rate spreads and fees applicable to extensions of credit thereunder. Loans under the amended letter of credit agreement will continue to bear interest based on LIBOR plus the applicable margin. At September 28, 2007, the Company had total outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees of $1.1 billion. In the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In connection with the Separation, the Company entered into a liability sharing agreement regarding certain class actions that were pending against Tyco prior to the Separation. Subject to the 74 terms and conditions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Company will manage and control all the legal matters related to assumed contingent liabilities as described in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, including the defense or settlement thereof, subject to certain limitations. Tyco has assumed 27%, Covidien has assumed 42% and Tyco Electronics has assumed 31% of certain Tyco pre Separation contingent and other corporate liabilities, which include securities class action litigation, ERISA class action litigation, certain legacy tax contingencies and any actions with respect to the spin offs or the distributions made or brought by any third party except for litigation related to our public debt. Any amounts relating to these contingent and other corporate liabilities paid by Tyco after the spin offs that are subject to the allocation provisions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement will be shared among Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics pursuant to the same allocation ratio. As described in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Tyco, Tyco Electronics and Covidien are jointly and severally liable for all amounts relating to the previously disclosed securities class action settlement. All costs and expenses that Tyco incurs in connection with the defense of such litigation, other than the amount of any judgment or settlement, which will be allocated in the manner described above, will be borne equally by Covidien, Tyco Electronics and Tyco. Legal Matters Class Actions For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos securities class actions, class action settlement, securities class action proceedings, shareholder derivative litigation, ERISA related litigation, Tyco litigation against former senior management, litigation related to our public debt and various other legal matters, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings. We are generally obligated to indemnify our directors and officers and our former directors and officers who are named as defendants in some or all of these matters to the extent required by Bermuda law. In addition, our insurance carriers may decline coverage, or our coverage may be insufficient to cover our expenses and liability, in some or all of these matters. While we may from time to time seek to engage plaintiffs counsel in settlement discussions, we are unable at this time to estimate what our ultimate liability in these matters may be, and it is possible that we will be required to pay judgments or settlements and incur expenses, in excess of any insurance coverage, in aggregate amounts that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Investigations For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to governmental investigations related to Tyco, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Subpoenas and Document Requests From Governmental Entities. We cannot predict when these investigations will be completed, nor can we predict what the results of these investigations may be. It is possible that we will be required to pay material fines, consent to injunctions on future conduct, lose the ability to conduct business with government entities or instrumentalities (which in turn could negatively impact our business with non governmental customers) or suffer other penalties or adverse impacts, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. It is not possible to estimate the amount of loss, or range of possible loss, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters. Environmental Matters For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos environmental matters, see Item 1. Business Environmental Matters. 75  Asbestos Matters Tyco and some of its subsidiaries and certain subsidiaries of Covidien are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Covidien has assumed all liabilities for pending cases filed against Covidiens subsidiaries. Consistent with the national trend of increased asbestos related litigation, the Company has observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits in the past several years. A limited number of the cases allege premises liability, based on claims that individuals were exposed to asbestos while on a subsidiarys property. A majority of the cases involve product liability claims, based principally on allegations of past distribution of heat resistant industrial products incorporating asbestos or the past distribution of industrial valves that incorporated asbestos containing gaskets or packing. Each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants. Tycos involvement in asbestos cases has been limited because its subsidiaries did not mine or produce asbestos. Furthermore, in the Companys experience, a large percentage of these claims were never substantiated and have been dismissed by the courts. The Company will continue to vigorously defend the lawsuits that have been filed against it and its subsidiaries. To date, the Company has not suffered an adverse verdict in a trial court proceeding related to asbestos claims. When appropriate, the Company settles claims; however, the total amount paid in any year to settle and defend all asbestos claims has been immaterial. As of September 28, 2007, there were approximately 5,600 asbestos liability cases pending against the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company estimates its pending asbestos claims that were incurred but not reported, as well as related insurance and indemnification recoveries. The Companys estimate of the liability for pending and future claims is based on claim experience over the past five years and covers claims expected to be filed over the next seven years. The Company believes that it has adequate amounts recorded related to these matters. While it is not possible at this time to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome of these asbestos related proceedings, the Company believes that the final outcome of all known and anticipated future claims, after taking into account its substantial indemnification rights and insurance coverage, will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Income Taxes Tyco and its subsidiaries income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. The Company is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest that management has assessed as probable and estimable have been recorded. For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos income taxes, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Income Tax Matters. Compliance Matters Tyco has received and responded to various allegations and other information that certain improper payments were made by Tyco subsidiaries in recent years. As previously reported, we have been informed that two subsidiaries in our Flow Control business in Italy have been named in a request for criminal charges filed by the Milan public prosecutors office. Tyco has reported to the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the SEC the investigative steps and remedial measures that it has taken in response to the allegations. Tyco also informed the DOJ and the SEC that it has retained outside counsel to perform a company wide baseline review of its policies, controls and practices with respect to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), that it would continue to make periodic progress reports to these agencies, and that it would present its factual findings upon conclusion of the baseline review. The Company has and will continue to communicate with the DOJ 76 and SEC to provide updates on the baseline review being conducted by outside counsel, including, as appropriate, briefings concerning additional instances of potential improper payments identified by the Company in the course of its ongoing compliance activities. Covidien and Tyco Electronics agreed, in connection with the Separation, to cooperate with the Company in its response to these allegations. To date, the baseline review has revealed that some business practices may not comply with Tyco and FCPA requirements. At this time, Tyco cannot predict the outcome of these matters and other allegations reported to regulatory and law enforcement authorities and therefore cannot estimate the range of potential loss or extent of risk, if any, that may result from an adverse resolution of these matters. However, it is possible that the Company may be required to pay judgments, suffer penalties or incur settlements in amounts that may have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos compliance matters, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Compliance Matters. Other Matters The Company is a party to a contract dispute arising from Earth Techs contract with the City of Phoenix, Arizona for the expansion of the Citys 91st Avenue Waste Water Treatment Plant. Both Earth Tech and the City of Phoenix have filed lawsuits in the local county superior court alleging the other party has breached the contract. At this time, Tyco cannot predict the outcome of this matter and therefore cannot estimate the range of potential loss or extent of risk, if any, that may result from an adverse resolution of this matter. For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos other matters, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Other Matters. The Company is a defendant in a number of other pending legal proceedings incidental to present and former operations, acquisitions and dispositions. The Company does not expect the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Backlog At September 28, 2007, we had a backlog of unfilled orders of $9.1 billion, compared to a backlog of $8.2 billion at September 29, 2006. We expect that approximately 86% of our backlog at September 28, 2007 will be filled during 2008. Backlog by segment at September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006 is as follows ($ in millions): 2007 2006 ADT Worldwide $ 6,137 $ 5,776 Fire Protection Services 1,108 1,050 Flow Control 1,579 1,115 Safety Products 144 133 Electrical and Metal Products 113 101 Corporate and Other 4 3 $ 9,085 $ 8,178 Within ADT Worldwide, backlog increased primarily as a result of strong bookings across all regions. Backlog for ADT Worldwide also includes recurring revenue in force, which represents 12 months fees for monitoring and maintenance services under contract in the security business. The amount of recurring revenue in force at September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006 was $3.93 billion and $3.65 billion, respectively. Backlog within Fire Protection Services increased primarily as a result of increased orders in North America. Flow Control had increased bookings mostly in the Asia Pacific and Europe regions. 77  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale of Accounts Receivable Certain of Tycos international businesses utilize the sale of accounts receivable as short term financing mechanisms. The aggregate amount outstanding under the Companys remaining international accounts receivable programs was $76 million, $75 million and $79 million at September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005, respectively. Guarantees Certain of the Companys business segments have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from 2008 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. There are certain guarantees or indemnifications extended among Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics in accordance with the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Tax Sharing Agreement. At the time of the Separation, Tyco recorded a liability necessary to recognize the fair value of such guarantees and indemnifications in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation ("FIN") No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." Fair values were determined with the assistance of a third party valuation firm. The liability necessary to reflect the fair value of these guarantees and indemnifications is $543 million, which is included in other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the Tax Sharing Agreement. See Note 16 for further discussion of the Tax Sharing Agreement. In addition, Tyco historically provided support in the form of financial and or performance guarantees to various Covidien and Tyco Electronics operating entities. In connection with the Separation, the Company worked with the guarantee counterparties to cancel or assign these guarantees to Covidien or Tyco Electronics. To the extent these guarantees were not assigned prior to the Separation date, Tyco assumed primary liability on any remaining support. The estimated fair values of those obligations are $7 million, which are included in other liabilities with an offset to shareholders equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and were recorded in accordance with FIN No. 45. In disposing of assets or businesses, the Company often provides representations, warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. The Company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the Company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. In the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 78  The Company records estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. For further information on estimated product warranty, see Notes 1 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2001, a division of Safety Products initiated a Voluntary Replacement Program ("VRP") associated with the acquisition of Central Sprinkler. The VRP relates to the replacement of certain O ring seal sprinkler heads which were originally manufactured by Central Sprinkler prior to Tycos acquisition. Under this program, the sprinkler heads are being replaced free of charge to property owners. In the third quarter of 2006, the Company completed a comprehensive review of reported claims, recent claim rates and cost trends and further assessed the future of the program. The Company determined that an additional liability was necessary in order to satisfy the Companys obligation under the VRP. As a result, the Company recorded a $100 million charge which was reflected in cost of sales. On May 1, 2007, the Consumer Products Safety Commission and the Company announced an August 31, 2007 deadline for filing claims to participate in the VRP. The Company will fulfill all valid claims for replacement of qualifying sprinklers received up to August 31, 2007. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company further assessed the expected cost to complete the program in light of the most current claims data and determined that an additional accrual of $10 million was necessary to satisfy the estimated remaining obligation. The ultimate cost to complete the program will be impacted by a number of factors such as changes in material and labor costs, and the actual number of sprinkler heads replaced. Actual results could differ from this estimate. Settlements during 2007 include cash expenditures of $38 million related to the VRP.  Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)." SFAS No. 158 requires that employers recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as a net asset or liability on the balance sheet and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. Under SFAS No. 158, companies are required to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of their fiscal year end. The Company presently uses a measurement date of August 31st. SFAS No. 158 also requires additional disclosure in the notes to the financial statements. The recognition provisions of SFAS No. 158 are effective for fiscal 2007, while the measurement date provisions become effective in fiscal 2009. The Company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158 as of September 28, 2007. The Company recognized a net $111 million liability through a reduction in shareholders equity. In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 108, "Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements." SAB No. 108 requires that companies utilize a "dual approach" in assessing the quantitative effects of financial statement misstatements. The dual approach includes both an income statement focused and balance sheet focused assessment. SAB No. 108 is effective for Tyco in fiscal 2007. The implementation of SAB No. 108 did not have a material impact on Tycos results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities." SFAS No. 159 permits an entity, on a contract by contract basis, to make an irrevocable election to account for certain types of financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value, rather than historical cost, with changes in the fair value, whether realized or unrealized, recognized in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for Tyco in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. 79 The Company is currently assessing the impact that SFAS No. 159 will have on the results of its operations, financial position or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements," which enhances existing guidance for measuring assets and liabilities at fair value. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for Tyco beginning in fiscal 2009. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, that SFAS No. 157 will have on the results of its operations, financial position or cash flows. In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109." This Interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. FIN No. 48 is effective for Tyco in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The Company is currently implementing and assessing the expected impact of adopting FIN No. 48. Based on the assessment to date, management does not expect the adoption to have a material effect on the results of its operations, financial position or cash flows.  Forward Looking Information Certain statements in this report are "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the ordinary course of conducting business, we are exposed to certain risks associated with potential changes in market conditions. These risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Accordingly, we have established a comprehensive risk management process to monitor, evaluate and manage the principal exposures we assume. We seek to manage these risks through the use of financial derivative instruments. Our portfolio of derivative financial instruments may, from time to time, include forward foreign currency exchange contracts, cross currency swaps, foreign currency options, and interest rate swaps. Derivative financial instruments related to interest rate sensitivity of debt obligations, intercompany cross border transactions and anticipated non functional currency cash flows are used with the goal of mitigating a significant portion of these exposures when it is cost effective to do so. We do not execute transactions or utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, to reduce the risk that a counterparty will be unable to honor its contractual obligations to us, we only enter into contracts with counterparties having at least an A/A2 long term debt rating. These counterparties are generally financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one party. During fiscal year 2007, the Company elected to change its presentation of market risk information from a tabular format to a disclosure based on the results of sensitivity analysis. Management believes this method of presentation provides more useful information for assessing the Companys overall exposure to market risks. The results of our sensitivity analysis represent an estimate of reasonably possible outcomes based on hypothetical market conditions and are not necessarily indicative of actual results. Although, there were no material changes in our primary risk exposures and risk management activities, our level of exposure decreased across all risk categories as a result of the spin off of our Healthcare and Electronics businesses. 81 Foreign Currency Exposures We economically hedge our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts and options. During 2007, our largest exposures to foreign exchange rates existed primarily with the British Pound, Euro, Brazilian Real, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar against the U.S. Dollar. The market risk related to the forward foreign exchange contracts is measured by estimating the potential impact of a 10% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates. The rates used to perform this analysis were based on the market rates in effect on September 28, 2007. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in a $248 million net increase in the fair value of the contracts. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in a $303 million net decrease in the fair value of the contracts. However, gains or losses on these derivative instruments are economically offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. Previously, we hedged our investment in certain foreign operations. In December 2006, due to required changes to the legal entity structure to facilitate the Separation, the Company determined that it will no longer consider certain intercompany foreign currency transactions to be long term investments. As a result, the related foreign currency transaction gains and losses on such investments were recorded in the income statement subsequent to this determination rather than to the currency translation component of shareholders equity. Forward contracts that were previously designated as hedges of these net investments continued to be used to manage this exposure but were no longer designated as net investment hedges. Also in connection with the Separation and the debt tender, the Company de designated its 6.125% Euro denominated public notes due 2007 on March 29, 2007, its 5.5% Euro denominated public notes due 2008 and its 6.5% British Pound denominated public notes due 2031 on May 21, 2007, that had previously been considered as hedges of net investments in certain foreign operations. At September 28, 2007, the Company did not hedge its net investment in foreign operations, and all of its outstanding borrowings were denominated in U.S. dollars. Interest Rate Exposures Our long term debt portfolio primarily consists of fixed rate instruments. Historically, the Company managed its exposure to interest rates by entering into interest rate and cross currency swaps designated as fair value hedges. In assessing the potential risks related to movements in interest rates, we terminated the interest rate and cross currency swaps in several tranches beginning in the fourth quarter of 2006. During the first quarter of 2007, we terminated the remaining contracts with a total notional amount of $0.6 billion, resulting in an aggregate terminated notional amount of $3.1 billion. The settlement of these swaps resulted in a net cash inflow of $63 million for the first quarter of 2007. Since the interest rate swaps were designated as hedging instruments of outstanding debt, the related $32 million loss adjustment to the carrying value of the related debt will be amortized over the remaining life of the related debt instruments. In connection with the debt tender offer, $9 million of unamortized loss on interest rate swaps was accelerated and recorded as a loss on retirement of debt and included in other expense, net (see Note 13). At September 28, 2007 there were no interest rate swaps outstanding. Commodity Exposures We are exposed to volatility in the prices of raw materials used in some of our products and may, in limited circumstances, enter into hedging contracts to manage those exposures. These exposures are monitored as an integral part of our risk management program. At September 28, 2007, the Company did not hedge its exposure attributable to changes in commodity prices but may consider such strategies in the future. 82
