On December 9, 2004, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend on the Companys common shares from $0.05 to $0.40 per share. As a result, in 2005, Tyco paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per common share in the first quarter of 2005 and $0.40 per common share thereafter. Prior to 2005, Tyco paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per common share for all periods presented. (7)The decrease in total assets, long term debt and shareholders equity in 2007 is primarily related to the spin offs of Covidien and Tyco Electronics. 38   Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the Selected Financial Data and our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those under the headings "Risk Factors" and "Forward Looking Information." Introduction The Consolidated Financial Statements include the consolidated results of Tyco International Ltd., a company organized under the laws of Bermuda, and its subsidiaries (hereinafter collectively referred to as "we," the "Company" or "Tyco") and have been prepared in United States dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Company operates in the following business segments: ADT Worldwide designs, sells, installs, services and monitors electronic security systems for residential, commercial, industrial and governmental customers. Flow Control designs, manufactures, sells and services valves, pipes, fittings, valve automation and heat tracing products for the water and wastewater markets, the oil, gas and other energy markets along with general process industries. Fire Protection Services designs, sells, installs and services fire detection and fire suppression systems for commercial, industrial and governmental customers. Electrical and Metal Products designs, manufactures and sells galvanized steel tubing, armored wire and cable and other metal products for non residential construction, electrical, fire and safety and mechanical customers. Safety Products designs, manufactures and sells fire protection, security and life safety products, including fire suppression products, breathing apparatus, intrusion security, access control and video management systems. In addition, Safety Products manufactures products installed and serviced by ADT Worldwide and Fire Protection Services. We also provide general corporate services to our segments and these costs are reported as Corporate and Other. References to the segment data are to the Companys continuing operations. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to exclude the results of discontinued operations. Overview and Outlook Fiscal year 2008 was a year of progress for Tyco, as revenue increased by 9% and income from continuing operations significantly improved compared to 2007. We also made significant progress in executing our business strategies. Looking forward to fiscal 2009, like most businesses, we expect market conditions to negatively affect our results. First, because over 50% of our revenue is generated outside of the U.S., the recent significant appreciation of the U.S. dollar against most major currencies could negatively impact our revenue in 2009. Specifically, the value of the local currencies used in our non U.S. operations has declined relative to the U.S. dollar by approximately 20%, mostly during the fourth fiscal quarter and into October of 2008. If exchange rates remained at these levels, our non U.S. revenue would likely decline by a similar magnitude in fiscal 2009. Second, we expect the operating margins in our Electrical and Metals segment to decline in 2009 as a result of declining steel and 39 copper prices. As noted in our Critical Accounting Policies, we account for our inventory on a first in, first out basis. As a result, in a declining price environment like the one we are in today, operating margins are likely to contract as higher priced inventory is processed and sold at lower prices. Third, we have recently seen a decline in commercial construction activity, both in the United Kingdom and the U.S. We expect continued weakness in the commercial construction market to negatively impact our results in the ADT Worldwide segment. Operationally, in 2009, we expect to continue our initiatives to improve our efficiency, manage our working capital effectively, refine our portfolio and prudently allocate our capital. We expect internal investments to fund growth and productivity in our businesses to continue to be our first priority. As in prior years, we expect to remain active in making bolt on acquisitions as we continually assess the strategic fit and value of businesses that have potential for success within our existing framework. During 2008, our ADT Worldwide segment acquired FirstService Security to strengthen its systems integration capabilities. In addition, during 2008, ADT acquired two Sensormatic franchisees: Winner Security Services LLC and Sensormatic Security Corp. At the same time that we selectively pursue acquisitions, we will consider divestitures where businesses do not align with our long term strategy. In fiscal 2008, as part of our portfolio refinement efforts, we sold a subsidiary that makes and sells fire protection products in Japan, a European manufacturer of building products for the construction industry, a European manufacturer of public address and acoustic systems, and substantially all of our Infrastructure Services business. These divestitures resulted in cash proceeds of approximately $1.0 billion. The results of these businesses are included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. In addition to using cash flow to fund internal investments and make selective acquisitions, we expect to have excess cash to return to our shareholders. During 2008, we completed the $1.0 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in September 2007, which resulted in the purchase of approximately 5% of our outstanding shares during the program. In addition, during 2008, we paid dividends of $292 million to shareholders, and on September 9, 2008 our Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend on our common shares to $0.20 per share from $0.15 per share, which was paid on November 3, 2008 to shareholders of record on October 1, 2008. On July 10, 2008, our Board of Directors approved a new $1.0 billion share repurchase program, which we intend to use to repurchase additional shares depending on credit market conditions, macroeconomic factors and our expectations regarding future cash flows. Finally, we continue to focus on operational execution to drive earnings growth. To further improve operating efficiency, during the first quarter of 2007, we launched a restructuring program across all of our segments, including the corporate organization, designed to streamline some of our businesses and reduce our operational footprint. Since the inception of this program through the end of fiscal 2008, we have incurred charges of approximately $395 million. We have identified additional opportunities for cost savings from restructuring activities in fiscal 2009 and expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately $50 million in fiscal 2009. We believe this restructuring activity will strengthen our competitive position over the long term. Legal Settlements In connection with the settlement of litigation related to our outstanding public debt, on June 3, 2008 we, along with our finance subsidiary TIFSA, Tyco International Finance S.A. ("TIFSA"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and successor company to Tyco International Group S.A. ("TIGSA"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company organized under the laws of Luxembourg, consummated consent solicitations and exchange offers related to certain series of debt issued under the Companys consent payments totaling $250 million, and we recorded a $222 million charge to other expense, net as a loss on extinguishment of debt. We also terminated our unsecured bridge loan facility entered into on November 27, 2007 in connection with the settlement of the Indenture Trustee 40 Litigation and recorded a $36 million charge to other expense to write off unamortized debt issuance costs. During the third quarter of 2008, the Company signed a definitive agreement with the plaintiff to settle the lawsuit entitled New Jersey v. Tyco International Ltd., et al. In connection with the settlement, the Company made a payment of $73.25 million to the plaintiffs on June 2, 2008. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Companys share of the settlement amount was approximately $20 million, with Covidien and Tyco Electronics responsible for approximately $30 million and $23 million, respectively. The Company recorded the settlement and related receivable from each of Covidien and Tyco Electronics for their respective shares of the settlement amount in the second quarter of 2008 resulting in a net charge to selling, general and administrative expenses for its share of the settlement of approximately $20 million. Also in the third quarter of 2008, the Company settled the lawsuit entitled Ballard v. Tyco International Ltd. Pursuant to the settlement, the Company made a payment of $36 million to the plaintiffs, which was subject to the sharing formula contained in the Separation and Distribution Agreement and resulted in the Company recording a net charge to selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately $10 million and recording receivables from Tyco Electronics and Covidien of approximately $11 million and $15 million, respectively, in the third quarter. Also in the third quarter of 2008, the Company settled the matter entitled The Bank of New York v. Tyco International Group S.A., a lawsuit related to the Separation brought by the indenture trustee of certain of Tycos public debt. In connection with the settlement, Tyco exchanged approximately $422 million principal amount of notes due 2028 and $707 million principal amount of notes due 2029 for an equal principal amount of notes due 2019 and 2021, respectively. The terms of the exchange notes are substantially the same as the terms of the notes for which they were exchanged. In addition, each series of notes issued under Tycos indentures dated June 9, 1998 and December 31, 2003 (including the exchange notes) were amended to provide noteholders with the right to require Tyco to repurchase their notes for a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase, in the event that a ratings downgrade occurs in connection with certain change of control transactions. Also in the third quarter of 2008, the Company settled the matter entitled Sensormatic Security Corp. v. Sensormatic Electronics Corp., ADT Security Services, Inc. and Wallace Computer Services, Inc. in connection with its purchase of the Sensormatic franchisees Maryland, Virginia and District of Columbia franchise. As part of the settlement and the franchise acquisition, the Company paid a total of approximately $86 million to the franchisee which includes $20 million for the reacquisition of franchise rights that were deemed unfavorable to the Company when compared to pricing for current market transactions for similar arrangements and $6 million related to a legal settlement. In the second quarter of 2008, the Company settled a contract dispute arising under its former Infrastructure Services business relating to the City of Phoenixs 91st Avenue Wastewater Treatment Plant. The settlement included a general release of all claims by each party to the litigation without any party making any payment to any other party. In connection with the settlement, the Company assessed its assets under the original contract with the City of Phoenix and concluded the assets were no longer recoverable, resulting in a $51 million charge to discontinued operations in the second quarter of 2008. In 2007, the Company settled 32 purported securities class action lawsuits arising from actions alleged to have been taken by prior management for $2.975 billion. Of this amount, the Company contributed $803 million, representing its share under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, to a $2.975 billion escrow account established in connection with the settlement. All legal contingencies that could have affected the final order approving the settlement expired on February 21, 2008, and the claims administrator is currently processing claims. The settlement did not purport to resolve all securities cases, and several of such cases remain outstanding. In addition, the settlement did not 41 release claims arising under ERISA and the lawsuits arising thereunder. As of the opt out deadline, Tyco had received opt out notices from individuals and entities totaling approximately 4% of the shares owned by class members. A number of these individuals and entities have filed claims separately against Tyco. Any judgments resulting from such claims or from claims that are filed in the future would not reduce the settlement amount. Generally, the claims asserted by these plaintiffs include claims similar to those asserted by the settling defendants; namely, violations of the disclosure provisions of federal securities laws. Tyco intends to vigorously defend any litigation resulting from opt out claims. It is not possible to predict the final outcome or to estimate the amount of loss or range of possible loss, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of the asserted or unasserted claims from individuals that have opted out or from any other legacy securities litigation. Should any of these cases result in an adverse judgment or be settled for a significant amount, they could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Under the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, each of Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics are jointly and severally liable for the full amount of any legacy securities action settlement (including ERISA claims) and any judgments resulting from opt out claims. Additionally, under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the companies shared in the liability and escrow accounts related to the class action settlement, with Tyco assuming 27%, Covidien 42% and Tyco Electronics 31% of the settlement amount. As a result, Tyco incurred a charge to expense, for which no tax benefit is available, and a current liability of $2.975 billion in the third quarter of 2007. Tyco borrowed under its unsecured bridge and credit facilities to fund the liability and placed the proceeds in escrow for the benefit of the class. In connection with the Separation, Covidien and Tyco Electronics assumed their portion of the related borrowing. The Company has also recovered certain of these costs from insurers. As a result, the Company recorded $113 million of recoveries in connection with the class action settlement in its Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2007. Based on the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Company recorded payables to Covidien and Tyco Electronics for their portion of the 2007 recoveries with an offset to shareholders equity. The Company recovered an additional $38 million of costs from insurers during 2008. The Company recorded payables to Covidien and Tyco Electronics for their respective shares of the 2008 recoveries resulting in a net $10 million credit recorded to class action settlement, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Since all legal contingencies that could have affected the settlement were exhausted on February 21, 2008, the administration and distribution of the settlement funds in escrow has been managed by the counsel of the certified class and Tyco is not subject to any further liability related to the class action settlement. As a result, Tyco has extinguished the class action liability and no longer has claim to the escrow account. The escrow accounts earned interest that was payable to the class. As a result, interest was also accrued on the class action settlement liability. On February 21, 2008, the class action liability and escrow account balances including interest were each $3.02 billion. Based on the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Tyco had a receivable from Covidien and Tyco Electronics for their portion of the liability of $1,257 million and $927 million, respectively at September 28, 2007 and corresponding payables to Covidien and Tyco Electronics for their interest in the escrow accounts. Receivables and payables that pertain to the class action settlement and related escrow accounts with the same counterparty were presented net in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Tycos portion of the liability was $808 million at September 28, 2007. These amounts were extinguished during the second quarter of 2008. 42 Operating Results Net revenue, operating income (loss) and net income (loss) for the years ended September 26, 2008, September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006 were as follows ($ in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Revenue from product sales $ 13,064 $ 11,816 $ 10,731 Service revenue 7,135 6,661 6,335 Net revenue $ 20,199 $ 18,477 $ 17,066 Operating income (loss) $ 1,941 $ (1,732 ) $ 1,355 Interest income 110 104 46 Interest expense (396 ) (313 ) (279 ) Other expense, net (224 ) (255 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest 1,431 (2,196 ) 1,122 Income taxes (335 ) (324 ) (304 ) Minority interest (1 ) (4 ) (1 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations 1,095 (2,524 ) 817 Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes 458 782 2,787 Income (loss) before cumulative effect of accounting change 1,553 (1,742 ) 3,604 Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of income taxes (14 ) Net income (loss) $ 1,553 $ (1,742 ) $ 3,590 Net revenue increased $1.7 billion, or 9.3%, for 2008 as compared to 2007 as a result of growth in all of our segments led by solid year over year increases in Flow Control, ADT Worldwide and Electrical and Metal Products. The increase in net revenue in Flow Control resulted from volume growth due to continued strength in most industrial end markets with significant project growth in the valves business. In addition, net revenue growth in ADT Worldwide was attributable to growth in all geographic regions, as well as growth in its North American recurring revenue base. Electrical and Metal Products experienced growth primarily due to selling price increases partially offset by a decrease in volume. Foreign currency exchange rates positively affected 2008 by $772 million while the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other activity positively affected 2008 by $35 million. Operating income increased $3.7 billion for 2008. Operating loss in 2007 included the class action settlement charge of $2.862 billion while 2008 operating income included a class action benefit of $10 million. Strong year over year income growth in all segments led by Flow Control, ADT Worldwide and Electrical and Metal Products, as well as lower corporate expenses contributed to the increase in operating income. Operating income was also favorably impacted as a result of lower Separation related costs and goodwill impairment charges. Separation related costs impacted operating income by $4 million and $105 million and goodwill impairment charges impacted operating income by $9 million and $46 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Additionally, operating income was negatively impacted by restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net of $248 million for 2008 and $210 million for 2007. Net revenue increased $1.4 billion, or 8.3%, for 2007 as compared to 2006 as a result of growth in all of our segments. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by Flow Control as a result of volume growth from continued strength in most industrial end markets. In addition, ADT Worldwide had strong growth in Asia and Latin America, as well as growth in its recurring revenue base and systems installation and service in North America. Fire Protection Services experienced continued growth in electronic and mechanical contracting. Foreign currency exchange rates positively affected 2007 by $580 million while the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures negatively affected 2007 by $48 million. 43 Operating income decreased $3.1 billion for 2007. Operating income was primarily impacted by the class action settlement charge, net of $2.862 billion. Revenue growth in all segments was partially offset by lower margins in Electrical and Metal Products primarily due to unfavorable spreads on both steel and copper products. Additionally, operating income was impacted by costs incurred relating to the Separation and the restructuring program announced in November 2006. Separation related costs impacted operating income by $105 million for 2007 and $49 million for 2006. Restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net impacted operating income by $210 million and $15 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Also impacting operating income was a goodwill impairment charge of $46 million due to the reorganization into our new management and segment reporting structure. In addition, 2006 was unfavorably affected by a $100 million charge relating to a pre existing voluntary replacement program for certain sprinkler heads, incremental stock option charges of $84 million as required under SFAS No. 123R, "Share Based Payment," and separation related costs of $49 million. Operating income for 2006 also included $72 million of income related to the extinguishment of certain payment obligations under a split dollar life insurance policy and rabbi trust pursuant to a settlement with Mr. Kozlowski, former Chief Executive Officer, and $48 million of income resulting from a reduction in our estimated workers compensation liabilities primarily due to favorable claims experience. Results by Geographic Area Net revenue by geographic area for the years ended September 26, 2008, September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006 was as follows ($ in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Net revenue(1): United States $ 9,661 $ 8,884 $ 8,617 Other Americas 1,537 1,445 1,354 Europe, Middle East and Africa 5,749 5,338 4,707 Asia Pacific 3,252 2,810 2,388 $ 20,199 $ 18,477 $ 17,066 (1)Revenue is attributed to individual countries based on the reporting entity that records the transaction. Segment Results The segment discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in results for each of our segments included in continuing operations. ADT Worldwide Net revenue, operating income and operating margin for ADT Worldwide for the years ended September 26, 2008, September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006 were as follows ($ in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Revenue from product sales $ 2,821 $ 2,734 $ 2,546 Service revenue 5,196 4,914 4,659 Net revenue $ 8,017 $ 7,648 $ 7,205 Operating income $ 910 $ 842 $ 907 Operating margin 11.4 % 11.0 % 12.6 % 44 Net revenue by geographic area for ADT Worldwide for the years ended September 26, 2008, September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006 was as follows ($ in millions): 2008 2007 2006 North America $ 4,218 $ 4,094 $ 3,985 Europe, Middle East and Africa 2,641 2,574 2,344 Rest of World 1,158 980 876 $ 8,017 $ 7,648 $ 7,205 Net revenue for ADT Worldwide increased $369 million, or 4.8%, during 2008, with product revenue up 3.2% and service revenue up 5.7%, as compared to 2007. Revenue from product sales includes sales and installation of electronic security and other systems. Service revenue is comprised of electronic security services and maintenance, including the monitoring of burglar alarms, fire alarms and other life safety systems as well as services related to retailer anti theft systems. Approximately 50% of ADTs total net revenue is contractual and is considered recurring revenue. Overall, recurring revenue grew 6.1% during 2008 while systems installation and service revenue grew 3.7%. Geographically, North America grew 3%, resulting largely from growth in recurring revenue which was partially offset by weakness in the retailer end market. The North America net revenue increase also includes the impact of acquisitions, which contributed $53 million. Although we experienced year over year net revenue increase in North America, this was partially offset by the retailer end market which continued to show signs of weakness during the fourth quarter of 2008. We will continue to monitor these market conditions as well as the current economic environment as we enter fiscal year 2009. Revenue in the EMEA region increased $67 million, or 2.6%, as a result of foreign currency exchange rates which had a favorable impact of $151 million. This increase was partially offset by a decline in systems installation and service revenue due to weakness in the retailer end market as well as commercial softness primarily in the United Kingdom. The 18.2% revenue growth in the Rest of World geographies was primarily driven by growth in both recurring revenue and contracting across all regions. The Rest of the World increase included the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $30 million. Overall, the ADT Worldwide net revenue increase included the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $213 million. The net impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and other activity positively affected revenue by $27 million. Operating margin in ADT Worldwide increased to 11.4% in 2008 from 11.0% in 2007. North America is one of the most profitable geographic areas for ADT Worldwide with 2008 and 2007 operating margin of 15.8% and 16.9%, respectively. Margins in North America were negatively impacted by $58 million of restructuring and asset impairments in 2008 compared to $8 million in 2007. Restructuring charges in 2008 include $58 million relating to the reacquisition of certain franchise rights that were deemed to be unfavorable to the Company. There were no charges related to the reacquisition of franchise rights in 2007. In addition, North America incurred $48 million and $12 million to convert customers from analog to digital signal transmissions in 2008 and 2007, respectively. North America operating margins benefited from continued growth in recurring revenue partially offset by declines in the retailer end market. ADT EMEA had 2008 and 2007 operating margin of 4.6% and 3.1%, respectively. EMEAs operating income included $52 million of restructuring and impairments in 2008 compared with $71 million in 2007. EMEA margins benefited from reduced costs as a result of the restructuring program, which was partially offset by volume decreases as discussed above. Attrition rates for customers in our ADT Worldwide business increased over the prior year to an average of 12.9% on a trailing 12 month basis for 2008, as compared to 12.3% for 2007 and 14.2% in 2006. The increased attrition was partially due to the analog to digital conversion project and partially due to the market conditions in the commercial business, which included customers switching from a 45 contractual service agreement to a time and material basis. Internationally, our attrition rate continued to improve. Operating income in 2008 increased $68 million, or 8.1%, as compared to 2007. Factors that positively impacted operating income included increased volume, particularly our higher margin recurring revenue, operational efficiencies, including those achieved from restructuring activities in Europe, lower depreciation and amortization expense and lower long lived asset impairment charges. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense occurred primarily in North America and resulted from changes to the depreciation method and estimated useful lives for pooled subscriber assets and changes to the estimated useful lives of dealer intangible assets. The reduction in depreciation and amortization expense was partially offset by increased net expenses of $51 million, which primarily related to converting customers from analog to digital signal transmissions in North America. Results for 2007 include goodwill impairment charges due to the reorganization of our management and segment reporting structure following the Separation. Net revenue for ADT Worldwide increased 6.1% during 2007, with product revenue up 7.4% and service revenue up 5.5%, as compared to 2006. The 2.7% revenue growth in North America resulted largely from an increase in commercial installations, primarily in the retailer market, as well as an increase in the recurring revenue base. Revenue in the EMEA region grew 9.8%, primarily driven by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The 11.9% revenue growth in the Rest of World geographies was primarily driven by strong growth in Asia and Latin America and, to a lesser extent, favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Overall, net revenue was favorably affected by $213 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates while the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures unfavorably impacted net revenue by $3 million. Operating income of $842 million in 2007 decreased $65 million from $907 million in 2006. Factors that positively impacted operating income included increased volume, operational efficiencies and reductions to depreciation and amortization expense, of $26 million. The decrease to depreciation and amortization expense resulted from changes to the depreciation method and estimated useful lives for pooled subscriber assets and changes to the estimated useful lives of dealer intangible assets. These increases were more than offset by a goodwill impairment charge of $46 million, due to the reorganization of our management and segment reporting structure, as well as increased investment in selling and marketing in Americas and Asia. In addition, results for 2007 included restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net of $83 million, which were primarily related to actions to improve field efficiencies and consolidating certain administrative functions in Europe, and an impairment of certain indefinite lived intangible assets. Restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net were $5 million in 2006. Flow Control Net revenue, operating income and operating margin for Flow Control for the years ended September 26, 2008, September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006 were as follows ($ in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Revenue from product sales $ 4,201 $ 3,618 $ 3,002 Service revenue 217 148 133 Net revenue $ 4,418 $ 3,766 $ 3,135 Operating income $ 618 $ 457 $ 356 Operating margin 14.0 % 12.1 % 11.4 % Net revenue for Flow Control increased $652 million, or 17.3%, in 2008 as compared to 2007. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by volume growth from continued strength in the valves and 46 thermal businesses, and to a lesser extent, the water business. The increase in the valves business was primarily driven by continued project growth in the oil and gas industry while the thermal business benefited primarily from continued strong project growth coupled with increased selling prices. While revenue within the water business increased year over year, project activity declined during the second half of 2008, primarily in Australia. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted revenue by $314 million. The net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other activity positively affected revenue by $6 million. Operating income increased $161 million, or 35.2%, in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily from revenue growth, as well as volume efficiencies. Flow Control incurred restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net of $8 million, compared to $28 million in 2007. Additionally, selling, general and administrative expenses in 2008 included an environmental remediation charge of $6 million related to the closure of a facility in North America as compared to no charges in 2007. Net revenue for Flow Control increased $631 million, or 20.1%, in 2007 as compared to 2006. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by volume growth from continued strength in most industrial end markets with significant project growth in the energy and water sectors. Growth in these sectors was strong across all geographical regions, and, in particular, Asia Pacific and Europe. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted revenue by $197 million while the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures unfavorably impacted net revenue by $16 million. The increase in operating income of $101 million, or 28.4%, in 2007 as compared 2006 was primarily due to revenue growth, as well as improved utilization rates. The increase in operating income during 2007 was partially offset by restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net of $28 million, which includes $6 million in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses. Fire Protection Services Net revenue, operating income and operating margin for Fire Protection Services for the years ended September 26, 2008, September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006 were as follows ($ in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Revenue from product sales $ 1,860 $ 1,790 $ 1,629 Service revenue 1,693 1,576 1,521 Net revenue $ 3,553 $ 3,366 $ 3,150 Operating income $ 321 $ 258 $ 241 Operating margin 9.0 % 7.7 % 7.7 % Net revenue for Fire Protection Services increased $187 million, or 5.6%, during 2008 as compared to 2007, driven by increases in both product sales and service revenues. Revenue from product sales includes sales and installation of fire protection and other systems. Service revenue comprises of inspection, maintenance, service and monitoring of fire detection and suppression systems. This increase in product sales was aided by foreign currency exchange rates, which had a favorable impact of $63 million. The increase in service revenue related to growth in service work and sprinkler contracting in North America and Asia primarily as a result of an increase in demand from the education and healthcare industries in North America and continued commercial expansion in the Asia Pacific region. Additionally, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact of $62 million on service revenue. The increase was partially offset by reduced revenue in EMEA and Australia/New Zealand primarily due to a decline in contracting revenue as a result of a strategic initiative to be more selective in our pursuit of contracts. Additionally, the net revenue increase was partially offset due to the planned exit of low performing non core activities in Latin America and Asia. Overall, the Fire 47 Protection Services net revenue increase included the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $125 million. Operating income increased $63 million, or 24.4%, during 2008 as compared to 2007 resulting largely from increased volume and improved margins, primarily in North America, and to a lesser extent, Asia and EMEA. The increase in operating income during 2008 was partially offset by $22 million of restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges. Also, operating income was unfavorably impacted by $9 million due to a goodwill impairment in the Latin America reporting unit. Net revenue for Fire Protection Services increased $216 million, or 6.9%, during 2007 as compared to 2006, driven largely by a 9.9% increase in revenue from product sales. This increase was largely the result of strong growth in most regions which benefited from continuing strength in commercial construction activity in our focused end markets. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact of $101 million while divestitures had a negative impact of $30 million. Operating income increased $17 million during 2007 as compared to 2006 resulting largely from increased volume, and improved margins, primarily in North America. Results for 2007 included restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net of $23 million, of which $1 million is included in cost of sales, primarily related to actions to improve field efficiencies and consolidate certain administrative functions in Europe. Operating income was unfavorably impacted by $1 million of divestiture charges, compared to no charges in 2006. Electrical and Metal Products Net revenue, operating income and operating margin for Electrical and Metal Products for the years ended September 26, 2008, September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006 were as follows ($ in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Revenue from product sales $ 2,266 $ 1,970 $ 1,946 Service revenue 6 4 3 Net revenue $ 2,272 $ 1,974 $ 1,949 Operating income $ 342 $ 159 $ 319 Operating margin 15.1 % 8.1 % 16.4 % Net revenue for Electrical and Metal Products increased $298 million, or 15.1%, in 2008 as compared to 2007. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by selling price increases for steel tubular products and to a lesser extent armored cable products partially offset by decreased sales volume for both products. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact of $44 million. Operating income increased $183 million, or 115.1%, in 2008 as compared to 2007. The increase in operating income was primarily due to favorable spreads on both steel tubular and armored cable products. As inventory is replenished at higher prices, the spreads will narrow, which will result in lower operating income. Income generated by higher selling prices for both steel tubular and armored cable products were partially offset by decreased sales volume for both products. Operational excellence initiatives resulted in reductions in production cost rates for both steel tubular and armored cable products. The increase in operating income during 2008 was partially offset by $43 million of restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, as compared to $7 million in 2007. Net revenue for Electrical and Metal Products increased $25 million, or 1.3%, in 2007 as compared to 2006. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $20 million contributed to the increase in revenue. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by increased sales volume of 48 armored cable products, steel tubular products, and higher selling prices and sales volumes in Brazil. These increases were largely offset by the impact of lower selling prices on steel tubular products in North America. The decrease in operating income of $160 million, or 50.2%, in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to unfavorable spreads on both steel tubular and armored cable products. Income generated by higher sales volume for both armored cable and steel tubular products were more than offset by lower selling prices and higher raw material prices. Results for 2007 included restructuring, asset impairment, and divestiture charges, net of $7 million, compared to no charges in 2006. Safety Products Net revenue, operating income and operating margin for Safety Products for the years ended September 26, 2008, September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006 were as follows ($ in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Revenue from product sales $ 1,916 $ 1,704 $ 1,608 Service revenue 18 15 16 Net revenue $ 1,934 $ 1,719 $ 1,624 Operating income $ 284 $ 274 $ 196 Operating margin 14.7 % 15.9 % 12.1 % Net revenue for Safety Products increased $215 million, or 12.5%, during 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily from strong performance in the fire suppression, and to a lesser extent electronic security and life safety businesses. The increase in the fire suppression business was driven by continued growth in the energy and marine sectors, favorable product mix and increased selling prices to offset increasing raw material costs. The increase in the life safety business was primarily driven by growth in North America as a result of increased spending by fire departments due to the release of federal funds, and from increased selling prices. The increase in the electronic security business was partially due to higher volume and new product introductions primarily related to casinos and schools. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $76 million also contributed to the increase in revenue. Operating income increased $10 million, or 3.6% in 2008 as compared to 2007. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to increased sales volume along with the impact of cost savings from operational excellence initiatives. The increase in operating income during 2008 was partially offset by $73 million of restructuring, asset impairment, and divestiture charges, net as compared to $29 million in 2007. Net revenue for Safety Products increased $95 million, or 5.8%, during 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily from strong performance in the fire suppression and electronic security businesses. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $49 million also contributed to the increase in revenue. The increase in the fire suppression business was driven by continued growth in the energy and marine sectors in the Americas and the Middle East as well as increased selling prices to help offset the significant cost increase of raw materials. The electronic security business also experienced favorable growth as a result of new product introductions and new market expansions. These increases were partially offset by continued softness in the life safety business in North America due to delays of federal assistance provided to fire departments. Operating income increased $78 million to $274 million for the year ended September 28, 2007 compared to the prior year. Prior year results included a $100 million charge related to a pre existing Voluntary Replacement Program ("VRP") for sprinkler heads in the fire suppression business. The deadline for filing claims to participate in the VRP ended on August 31, 2007. In light of the most current claims data, an additional $10 million charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007. Also, 49 2007 results include the effect of restructuring, asset impairment, and divestiture charges, net of $29 million. Corporate and Other Corporate expense for 2008 was $3.2 billion lower as compared to the prior year, primarily resulting from various charges in 2007, including the class action settlement charge of $2.862 billion, separation costs of $117 million and net restructuring and asset impairment charges of $40 million primarily related to the consolidation of certain headquarter functions. Corporate expense for 2008 included net charges of $28 million composed of a $29 million charge for a legacy legal settlement, $4 million of separation costs and $5 million for restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net, offset by a credit of $10 million for class action settlement recoveries. The remaining decrease in corporate expense is primarily related to cost reduction initiatives and the restructuring program. Corporate expense for 2006 included $72 million of income related to the extinguishment of certain payment obligations under a split dollar life insurance policy and rabbi trust pursuant to a settlement with Mr. Kozlowski, former Chief Executive Officer, and $48 million of income resulting from a reduction in our estimated workers compensation liabilities primarily due to favorable claims experience. These income items were partially offset by incremental stock option charges of $47 million required under SFAS No. 123R, Separation related costs of $49 million and restructuring and divestiture charges of $2 million. Interest Income and Expense Interest income was $110 million in 2008, as compared to $104 million and $46 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increases in interest income in 2008 and 2007 are primarily related to interest earned on the class action settlement escrow of $47 and $41 million, respectively. Interest expense was $396 million in 2008, as compared to $313 million in 2007 and $279 million in 2006. The increases in interest expense in 2008 and 2007 are a result of interest on the class action settlement liability of $47 and $41 million, respectively, and increased costs related to our bridge loan and revolving credit facilities. The weighted average interest rate on total debt outstanding at September 26, 2008, September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006 were 6.2%, 6.3% and 6.0%, respectively. In 2007 and 2006, net interest amounts were proportionally allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics based on the debt amounts that we believe were utilized by Covidien and Tyco Electronics historically inclusive of amounts directly incurred, and is included in discontinued operations. Allocated net interest was calculated using our historical weighted average interest rate on debt, including the impact of interest rate swap agreements. The portion of Tycos interest income allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics was $35 million and $53 million during 2007 and 2006, respectively. The portion of Tycos interest expense allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics was $242 million and $378 million during 2007 and 2006, respectively. 50  Other Expense, Net Other expense, net was $224 million in 2008 and $255 million in 2007. Other expense, net in 2008 primarily relates to the loss of $258 million on extinguishment of debt related to the consent solicitation and exchange offers and termination of the bridge loan facility offset by income of $6 million recorded in connection with the settlement of its 3.125% convertible senior debentures and related financial instruments. See Notes 13 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company also recorded other than temporary impairments and realized losses on the sale of investments of $6 million related primarily to investments in corporate debt. Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, the Company recorded $40 million of income as a result of an increase in the receivables due from Covidien and Tyco Electronics under the Tax Sharing Agreement upon the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation ("FIN") No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertain Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109." The Company also recorded $6 million of expense for other activity in accordance with the Tax Sharing Agreements during 2008. During 2007, other expense, net consisted primarily of a $259 million loss on early extinguishment of debt incurred in connection with debt tender offers undertaken in connection with the Separation, for which no tax benefit is available. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This charge consists primarily of premiums paid and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts. The total loss on early extinguishment of debt was $647 million, with $259 million included in continuing operations and $388 million allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics and included in discontinued operations. Income Taxes Effective Income Tax Rate Our effective income tax rate was 23.4% for 2008. Income taxes during 2008 were positively impacted by increased profitability in lower tax rate jurisdictions and release of deferred tax valuation allowances partially offset by enacted tax law changes that negatively impacted the non U.S. deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate for 2007 is not meaningful primarily as a result of the class action settlement charge, net of $2.862 billion and the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $259 million for which no tax benefit is available. Additionally, taxes for 2007 were negatively impacted by tax costs related to the Separation of $92 million and were favorably impacted by the release of a deferred tax valuation allowance related to non U.S. tax rulings received during the period and reduced reserve requirements on certain legacy tax matters. Our effective income tax rate for 2006 was 27.1%. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $745 million and $644 million at September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," which requires a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is "more likely than not" that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the 51 tax liabilities. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by these taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as payment is not expected within one year. Tax Sharing Agreement In connection with the spin offs of Covidien and Tyco Electronics from Tyco, Tyco entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that generally governs Covidiens, Tyco Electronics and Tycos respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations after the Separation with respect to taxes, including ordinary course of business taxes and taxes, if any, incurred as a result of any failure of the distribution of all of the shares of Covidien or Tyco Electronics to qualify as a tax free distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 355 of the Code or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin offs to qualify for tax favored treatment under the Code. Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, the Company shares responsibility for certain of Tycos, Covidiens and Tyco Electronics income tax liabilities based on a sharing formula for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. More specifically, Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics share 27%, 42% and 31%, respectively, of shared income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to Tycos, Covidiens and Tyco Electronics U.S. income tax returns. All costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are shared equally among the parties. Tyco has recorded a receivable from Covidien and Tyco Electronics of $113 million at September 26, 2008 and $103 million at September 28, 2007 which is included in other assets as our estimate of their portion of the Tax Sharing obligations. Other liabilities include $554 million and $543 million at September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007, respectively for the fair value of Tycos obligations under the Tax Sharing Agreement, determined in accordance with FIN No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." Tyco assesses the shared tax liabilities and related FIN No. 45 liability at each reporting period. The receivable and liability were initially recognized with an offset to shareholders equity in 2007. In the first quarter of 2008, in connection with the adoption of FIN No. 48 and the related increase in uncertain tax positions for shared tax liabilities under the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco increased its receivable from Covidien and Tyco Electronics under the Tax Sharing Agreement with a corresponding increase to other income, net by $40 million ($0.08 for both basic and diluted earnings per share). In addition, $6 million of expense for other activity was recorded in accordance with the Tax Sharing Agreement during 2008. Tyco will provide payment under the Tax Sharing Agreement as the shared income tax liabilities are settled. Settlement is expected to occur as the audit process by local taxing authorities is completed for the impacted years. Given the nature of the shared liabilities, the maximum amount of potential future payments is not determinable. In the event the Separation is determined to be taxable and such determination was the result of actions taken after the Separation by Tyco, Covidien or Tyco Electronics, the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on Tyco, Covidien or Tyco Electronics as a result thereof. If such determination is not the result of actions taken after the Separation by Tyco, Covidien or Tyco Electronics, then Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics would be responsible for 27%, 42% and 31%, respectively, of any taxes imposed on Tyco, Covidien or Tyco Electronics as a result of such determination. Such tax amounts could be significant. The Company is responsible for all of its own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreements sharing formula. In addition, Covidien and Tyco Electronics are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the Tax Sharing Agreements sharing formula. 52 If any party to the Tax Sharing Agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no partys fault, each non defaulting party would be required to pay, equally with any other non defaulting party, the amounts in default. In addition, if another party to the Tax Sharing Agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority, the Company could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, the Company may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of its agreed upon share of Tycos, Covidiens and Tyco Electronics tax liabilities. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of guarantees and indemnifications extended between Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics. Other Income Tax Matters The Company and its subsidiaries income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. The Company is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Management has assessed the issues related to these adjustments for recognition and measurement under FIN No. 48 and has recorded unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with FIN No. 48. The ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain and could result in a material impact to the Companys financial position, results of operations, cash flows or the effective tax rate in future reporting periods. In 2004, in connection with the IRS audit of the 1997 through 2000 years, the Company submitted to the IRS proposed adjustments to these prior period U.S. federal income tax returns resulting in a reduction in the taxable income previously filed. During 2006, the IRS accepted substantially all of the proposed adjustments, and the Company developed proposed amendments to U.S. federal income tax returns for additional periods through 2002. On the basis of previously accepted amendments, the Company has determined that these adjustments will more likely than not be accepted and, accordingly, has recorded them in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such adjustments did not have a material impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, during 2008 the Company completed proposed amendments to its U.S. federal income tax returns for periods subsequent to 2002, which primarily reflect the roll forward through 2006 of the amendments for the periods 1997 to 2002. Such adjustments did not have a material impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. While the final adjustments cannot be determined until the income tax return amendment process and the IRS review is completed, the Company believes that any resulting adjustments will not have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. During the third quarter of 2007, the IRS concluded its field examination of certain of Tycos U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 though 2000 and issued anticipated Revenue Agents Reports ("RARs") which reflect the IRS determination of proposed tax adjustments for the periods under audit. The RARs propose tax audit adjustments to certain of the Companys previously filed tax return positions. The Company agreed with the IRS on adjustments totaling $498 million, with an estimated cash impact to the Company of $458 million, and during the third quarter of 2007, the Company paid $458 million, of which $163 million related to the Companys discontinued operations. The Company appealed other proposed tax audit adjustments totaling approximately $1 billion relating to Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics, and, as Audit Managing Party as specified in the Tax Sharing Agreement, the Company intends to vigorously defend its prior filed tax return positions. During the second quarter of 2008, the IRS issued additional RARs asserting a withholding tax liability of approximately $106 million associated with the prior proposed tax adjustments related to Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics for the 1997 to 2000 period. The withholding tax amount asserted against Tyco is immaterial. During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company reached an agreement 53 with the IRS appeals team to work towards timely resolution of all unagreed issues related to this time period. The Company, as Audit Managing Party as specified in the Tax Sharing Agreement, intends to vigorously defend its prior filed tax return positions and determined that no adjustment is required to the Companys guarantees and indemnifications liability recorded in conjunction with the Tax Sharing Agreement as discussed in "Guarantees" within Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Additionally, the IRS is auditing the prior tax returns of the Company, which include legal entities of Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics for the 2001 to 2004 period. The IRS has not issued any RARs for this period. The IRS proposed civil fraud penalties against a prior subsidiary that was distributed to Tyco Electronics arising from alleged actions of former executives in connection with intercompany transfers of stock of Simplex Technologies in 1998 and 1999. Based on statutory guidelines, we estimate the proposed penalties could range between $30 million and $50 million. The Company, as Audit Managing Party as specified in the Tax Sharing Agreement, intends to vigorously oppose the assertion of any such penalties against Tyco Electronics, in part, because beginning in 2003 the Company discovered, investigated and reported the conduct at issue to the IRS and fully cooperated in the criminal prosecution of the Companys former Chief Tax Officer on a charge of willful filing of a false tax return. This is a pre Separation shared tax matter under the Tax Sharing Agreement. Except for earnings that are currently distributed, no additional material provision has been made for U.S. or non U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or the Company has concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of distribution of such earnings. A liability could arise if amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries. Divestitures Held for Sale and Reflected as Continuing Operations During the third quarter of 2008, the Company approved a plan to sell a business in the Safety Products segment. This business is presented in continuing operations as the criteria for discontinued operations has not been met. The Company has assessed and determined that the carrying value of this business is recoverable and will continue to assess recoverability based on current fair value, less cost to sell, until the business is sold. Fair value used for the impairment assessment was based on existing market conditions. The Company expects to complete a sale during the first half of fiscal 2009. Discontinued Operations The Company continued to assess the strategic fit of its various businesses and has pursued divestiture of certain businesses which do not align with its long term strategy. During 2008, as part of the Companys portfolio refinement efforts, the Company sold its ETEO business, Ancon business, NDC business, and a European manufacturer of public address products and acoustic systems. Additionally, the Company substantially completed the sale of its Infrastructure Services Business, during the fourth quarter of 2008. These businesses met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and have been included in discontinued operations in all periods presented. In May 2008, the Company sold 100% of the stock of ETEO, a Brazilian subsidiary of Infrastructure Services for $338 million of net cash proceeds and recorded a pre tax gain of $232 million, including the effects of the economic hedge of the purchase price discussed below. The gain was recorded in Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the Companys 54 Consolidated Statement of Operations. ETEO was part of the Companys Corporate and Other segment. During September 2007, Tyco entered into an economic hedge of the Brazilian Real denominated contractual sale price of the ETEO business. Since the hedging transaction was directly linked to the proceeds from the sale of a business that was reflected in discontinued operations, Tyco began including the impact of the hedge in discontinued operations during the first quarter of 2008. During the third quarter of 2008, Tyco incurred a pre tax loss of $36 million on this hedge. The impact of the hedge in the prior year was not material. In February 2008, the Company executed a definitive agreement to sell the remaining portion of Infrastructure Services excluding Earth Tech Brasil Ltda. ("ET Brasil") to AECOM Technologies Corporation ("AECOM"). In July 2008, the Company substantially completed the sale to AECOM. The sale was completed for $455 million net of a $20 million working capital adjustment resulting in net cash proceeds of $435 million. The $435 million of net cash proceeds includes $53 million for the sale of Earth Tech UK. A pre tax gain of approximately $183 million was recorded in income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations. In order to complete the sale, the Company is required to obtain consents and approvals to transfer the legal ownership of the Earth Tech UK businesses to AECOM. Therefore, in July 2008 the Company and AECOM entered into an agreement in which AECOM would manage the UK businesses on behalf of the Company, while the Company would finance the UK businesses operations. Also as part of the agreement, AECOM agreed to reimburse the Company for all of the funding provided by the Company through the closing date of the sale. As a result of the agreement, AECOM assumed all the risks and rewards of ownership for the UK businesses. At September 26, 2008, the necessary consents and approvals had not been obtained by the Company to transfer the legal ownership of the Earth Tech UK businesses to AECOM. The Company expects to record a gain related to the UK businesses upon receipt of the necessary consents and approvals, which is expected to occur in the first half of 2009. Certain assets in China were excluded from the sale and are expected to be transferred during the first half of 2009 for additional consideration of approximately $55 million once the necessary consents and approvals are obtained. Infrastructure Services, ET Brasil, the EarthTech UK business and the China assets discussed above were part of the Companys Corporate and Other segment. As ET Brasil was excluded from the sale to AECOM, as discussed above, the Company recorded a pre tax impairment charge of approximately $16 million to write down ET Brasil to its fair value, less cost to sell during 2008. Fair value used for the impairment assessment was based on existing market conditions. In July 2008, the Company executed a definitive agreement to sell ET Brasil for approximately $16 million in net cash proceeds. The sale is expected to close in the first quarter of 2009 upon receipt of the necessary consents and approvals. At September 26, 2008, the Company has assessed and determined that the carrying value of the remaining assets in China and ET Brasil are recoverable based on current fair value, less cost to sell. The Company will continue to assess recoverability until the assets in the China and ET Brasil are sold. During 2008, the Company settled a contract dispute arising under its former Infrastructure Services business. In connection with the settlement, the Company assessed its assets under the original contract and concluded the assets were no longer recoverable, resulting in a $51 million charge to discontinued operations. In April 2008, the Company sold Ancon, a manufacturer of stainless steel products used in masonry construction. Ancon was part of the Companys Corporate and Other segment. The sale was completed for $164 million in net cash proceeds and a pre tax gain of $100 million was recorded which was largely exempt from tax. The gain was recorded in income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company received an additional $6 million of proceeds related to the sale of Ancon. 55 In February 2008, the Company sold NDC, a company in the Japanese fire protection industry. NDC was part of the Companys Fire Protection and Safety Products Segments. The sale was completed for $50 million in net cash proceeds and a pre tax gain of $7 million was recorded. The gain was recorded in income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations. In January 2008, the Company sold a European manufacturer of public address products and acoustic systems which was part of the Companys Fire Protection Segment and recorded an $8 million pre tax loss on sale. The loss was recorded in income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations. During the first quarter of 2007, Aquas Industriales de Jose, C.A. ("AIJ"), a joint venture that was majority owned by Infrastructure Services, was sold for $42 million in net cash proceeds and a pre tax gain of $19 million was recorded. The gain was recorded in discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations. AIJ was part of the Companys Corporate and Other segment. During the third quarter of 2007, Tyco completed the Separation and has presented its Healthcare and Electronics businesses as discontinued operations in all periods presented. In each period prior to the Separation, net interest and loss on early extinguishment of debt, which is included in other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, amounts were proportionally allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics based on the debt amounts that Tyco believes were utilized by Covidien and Tyco Electronics historically inclusive of amounts directly incurred. Allocated net interest was calculated using our historical weighted average interest rate on debt including the impact of interest rate swap agreements. These allocated amounts were included in discontinued operations. During 2007, allocated interest income, interest expense and other expense, net was $35 million, $242 million and $388 million, respectively. During 2006, allocated interest income, interest expense and other expense, net was $53 million, $378 million and $0 million, respectively. During 2007, the Company incurred pre tax separation costs related primarily to professional services and employee related costs of $154 million and $289 million, respectively, in discontinued operations. Additionally, the year ended September 28, 2007 includes tax charges related to the Separation primarily for the write off of deferred tax assets that are no longer realizable of $88 million in discontinued operations. The Company has used available information to develop its best estimates for certain assets and liabilities related to the Separation. In limited instances, final determination of the balances will be made in subsequent periods. During the year ended September 28, 2007, $72 million was recorded through shareholders equity, primarily related to a cash true up adjustment of $57 million and $15 million of other items. During the year ended September 26, 2008, $70 million of other items was recorded through shareholders equity. The other items, which aggregate $85 million, reflect immaterial adjustments to shareholders equity which were recorded to correct the distribution amount at the date of Separation. Adjustments in the future for the impact of filing final income tax returns in certain jurisdictions where those returns include a combination of Tyco, Covidien and or Tyco Electronics legal entities and for certain amended income tax returns for the periods prior to the Separation may be recorded to either shareholders equity or the statement of income depending on the specific item giving rise to the adjustment. 56 Net revenue, income from operations, gain (loss) on sale, separation costs and income tax expense for discontinued operations for 2008, 2007 and 2006 are as follows ($ in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Net revenue $ 1,221 $ 19,271 $ 25,067 Pre tax income from discontinued operations $ 51 $ 2,816 $ 3,842 Pre tax gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations 484 (549 ) (245 ) Separation costs (719 ) (120 ) Income tax expense (77 ) (766 ) (690 ) Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes $ 458 $ 782 $ 2,787 Balance sheet information for pending divestitures at September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007 is as follows ($ in millions): 2008 2007 Accounts receivable, net $ 52 $ 438 Inventories 24 64 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 18 47 Property, plant and equipment, net 20 166 Goodwill and other intangibles, net 157 236 Other assets 113 434 Total assets $ 384 $ 1,385 Current maturities of long term debt $ 4 $ 5 Accounts payable 27 228 Accrued and other current liabilities 58 320 Long term debt 18 Other liabilities 39 91 Total liabilities $ 128 $ 662 Minority interest $ 1 $ 30 Losses on divestitures During 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded $1 million, $4 million and $2 million, respectively, of divestiture charges in continuing operations in connection with the write down to fair value, less cost to sell, of certain businesses, which did not get classified as discontinued operations as they did not meet the criteria for such classification. The fair value used for the impairment assessments was primarily based on the terms and conditions included or expected to be included in the sales agreements. Acquisitions As part of the Companys strategy to strengthen its product and service offerings and market positions, the Company acquired Winner Security Services LLC ("Winner"), Sensormatic Security Corp. ("SSC") and FirstService Security ("FirstService") during 2008. On June 5, 2008, the Companys ADT Worldwide segment acquired substantially all of the assets of Winner for $90 million. The franchise was originally granted by Sensormatic Electronics Corporation and granted Winner rights to sell, install and service certain Sensormatic products and entitled Winner to commissions on Sensormatic products sold, installed or shipped into its franchise territories. Sensormatic products are sold through ADT Worldwide and Safety Products. 57 On July 9, 2008, the Companys ADT Worldwide segment acquired substantially all of the assets of SSC, including franchise rights, and agreed to settle a related legal matter for total consideration of approximately $86 million. SSC was a franchisee of Sensormatic Electronics Corporation in the states of Virginia and Maryland and in the District of Columbia. It was the last remaining major Sensormatic franchise. Under the original franchise agreement, SSC was granted rights to sell, install and service certain Sensormatic products and was entitled to commissions on Sensormatic products sold, installed or shipped into its franchise territories. Sensormatic and SSC also settled the previously disclosed litigation between the parties related to the SSC franchise for $6 million in connection with the transaction. The value ascribed to the settlement of the legal matter was determined based on the consideration paid in excess of the fair value of the franchise and franchise rights acquired. These transactions were accounted for as business combinations and the Company applied EITF Issue No. 04 1, "Accounting for Preexisting Relationships between the Parties to a Business Combination," since there were preexisting relationships between the Company and Winner and SSC that needed to be assessed and accounted for separately. After assessing the specific facts and circumstances related to these transactions, the Company recorded charges of $38 million and $20 million for Winner and SSC, respectively during 2008 for the reacquisition of franchise rights that were deemed to be unfavorable to the Company when compared to pricing for current market transactions for similar arrangements. The Company utilized an income method valuation approach in measuring the value of the preexisting relationship. Since these charges relate to a change in the manner in which the Company will conduct business in these territories, they have been reflected as restructuring charges. The remaining purchase price for Winner was $52 million, which consists of a $46 million indefinite lived intangible asset, $1 million of customer lists which are amortizable over a 10 year period and $5 million of goodwill. The remaining purchase price for SSC was $60 million, which consists of a $52 million indefinite lived intangible asset, $4 million of customer lists which are amortizable over a 10 year period and $4 million of goodwill. Goodwill associated with the Winner and SSC transactions is deductible for tax purposes. On June 30, 2008, the Companys ADT Worldwide segment acquired FirstService Security, a division of FirstService Corporation, for approximately $187 million. FirstService Security is a commercial security systems integrator and provides a full range of integrated security system services, including design, engineering, installation, servicing and monitoring of access control, closed circuit television and intrusion systems. The purchase price for FirstService has been allocated on a preliminary basis and consists of $38 million of net working capital and other assets, $5 million of property, plant and equipment, net, $52 million of intangible assets and $92 million of goodwill. Goodwill associated with the FirstService transaction is not deductible for tax purposes. Additionally during 2008, cash paid for other acquisitions included in continuing operations, primarily within ADT Worldwide and Safety Products, totaled $38 million. During 2007, cash paid for acquisitions included in continuing operations, primarily within ADT Worldwide, Safety Products and Flow Control, totaled $31 million. Cash paid for acquisitions by businesses included in continuing operations during 2006 was $5 million. These acquisitions were funded utilizing cash from operations. The results of operations of the acquired companies have been included in Tycos consolidated results from the respective acquisition dates. These acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The aggregate amounts paid for the acquired businesses have been allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on preliminary estimates of fair value at September 26, 2008. The purchase price allocation remains subject to change based on final valuations of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company does not expect the finalization of these matters to have a material 58 effect on these allocations. The following represents preliminary purchase price allocations for the acquired businesses ($ in million): Net working capital and other assets $ 21 Property, plant and equipment, net 7 Goodwill 140 Intangible assets, net 170 Purchase price $ 338 Payments relating to the reacquisition of unfavorable franchise rights and legal settlement 64 Aggregate amount paid $ 402 Acquisition Liabilities At September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007, acquisition liabilities were included in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows ($ in millions): 2008 2007 Accrued and other current liabilities $ 3 $ 4 Other liabilities 9 10 $ 12 $ 14 Acquisition liabilities relate to facility exit costs, employee severance and benefits, distributor and supplier cancellation fees and other costs. The Company paid $2 million, $5 million and $5 million to fund acquisition liabilities during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Holdback Liabilities The Company paid cash of approximately $5 million and $2 million during 2007 and 2006, respectively, relating to holdback liabilities related to certain prior period acquisitions. There were no such payments in 2008. Holdback liabilities represent a portion of the purchase price withheld from the seller pending finalization of the acquisition balance sheet and other contingencies. At September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007, holdback liabilities were included in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows ($ in millions): 2008 2007 Other liabilities $ 18 $ 16 ADT Dealer Program During 2008, 2007 and 2006, Tyco paid $376 million, $409 million and $373 million of cash, respectively, to acquire approximately 370,000, 415,000 and 401,000 customer contracts for electronic security services through the ADT dealer program. Goodwill Impairment Annually and more frequently if triggering events occur, the Company tests goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. Fair value for the goodwill impairment test is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the Companys future budgets discounted using the Companys weighted average cost of capital and market indicators of terminal year cash flows. Other valuation methods are used to corroborate the discounted 59 cash flow method. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered potentially impaired. During the annual goodwill impairment testing for the fiscal year ended September 26, 2008, the carrying amount of goodwill in the Latin America Fire Protection business, part of the Fire Protection Services segment, exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill. As a result, the Company recognized a goodwill impairment of $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Furthermore, the Company believes its goodwill balance at September 26, 2008 is recoverable. In connection with the Separation, during the third quarter of 2007 Tyco reorganized into a new management and segment reporting structure. As part of these organizational changes, the Company assessed new reporting units and conducted valuations to determine the assignment of goodwill to the new reporting units based on their estimated relative fair values. Following the relative fair value goodwill allocation, the Company then tested goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded its fair value, goodwill was considered potentially impaired. Where goodwill was potentially impaired, we compared the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill to the carrying amount of that goodwill. The carrying amount of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill in the Australia and New Zealand Security Services business, part of the ADT Worldwide segment. As a result, the Company recognized a goodwill impairment of $46 million in the third quarter of 2007. In determining fair value, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgments in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. However, fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in the factors described above. In light of current economic conditions, additional impairments to one or more of our reporting units could occur in future periods whether or not connected to the annual impairment analysis. The Company has certain reporting units which have limited excess of fair value over carrying value. The goodwill balance for reporting units with less than a ten percent excess of fair value over carrying value in the aggregate was approximately $2.4 billion at September 26, 2008. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change During 2006, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation ("FIN") No. 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143." FIN No. 47 clarifies the timing of liability recognition for legal obligations associated with an asset retirement when the timing and (or) method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity and clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. FIN No. 47 requires that conditional asset retirement obligations, along with the associated capitalized asset retirement costs, be initially reported at their fair values. Upon adoption, the Company recognized a liability of $32 million for asset retirement obligations and an increase of $10 million in the carrying amount of the related assets, of which $19 million and $5 million are reflected in liabilities and assets of discontinued operations, respectively. The initial recognition resulted in a cumulative effect of accounting change of $14 million after tax loss ($22 million pre tax), reflecting the accumulated depreciation and accretion that would have been recognized in prior periods had the provisions of FIN No. 47 been in effect at the time. 60   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. Depreciation and Amortization Methods for Security Monitoring Related Assets Tyco generally considers assets related to the acquisition of new customers in its electronic security business in three asset categories: internally generated residential subscriber systems, internally generated commercial subscriber systems (collectively referred to as subscriber system assets) and customer accounts acquired through the ADT dealer program (referred to as dealer intangibles). Subscriber system assets include installed property, plant and equipment for which Tyco retains ownership and deferred costs directly related to the customer acquisition and system installation. Subscriber system assets and any deferred revenue resulting from the customer acquisition are accounted for over the expected life of the subscriber. In certain geographical areas where the Company has a large number of customers that behave in a similar manner over time, the Company accounts for subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue using pools, with separate pools for the components of subscriber system assets and any related deferred revenue based on the month and year of acquisition. Effective as of the beginning of the third quarter of 2007, Tyco changed the depreciation method and estimated useful life used to account for pooled subscriber system assets (primarily in North America) and related deferred revenue from the straight line method with lives ranging from 10 to 14 years to an accelerated method with lives up to 15 years. The accelerated method utilizes declining balance rates based on geographical area ranging from 160% to 195% for residential subscriber pools and 145% to 265% for commercial subscriber pools and converts to a straight line methodology when the resulting depreciation charge is greater than that from the accelerated method. The Company will continue to use a straight line method with a 14 year life for non pooled subscriber system assets (primarily in Europe and Asia) and related deferred revenue, with remaining balances written off upon customer termination. The change in the method and estimated useful life used to account for pooled subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue resulted from our ongoing analysis of all pertinent factors, including actual customer attrition data specific to customer categories and geographical areas, demand, competition, and the estimated technological life of the installed systems. The pertinent factors have been influenced by managements ongoing customer retention programs, as well as tactical and strategic initiatives to improve service delivery, customer satisfaction, and the credit worthiness of the subscriber customer base. All pertinent factors, including actual customer attrition data specific to customer categories and geographical areas, demand, competition, and the estimated technological life of the installed systems, will continue to be reviewed by the Company at each balance sheet date to assess the continued appropriateness of methods and estimated useful lives. Effective as of the beginning of the third quarter of 2007, Tyco also changed the estimated useful life of dealer intangibles in geographical areas comprising approximately 90% of the net carrying value of dealer intangibles from 12 to 15 years. The Company continues to amortize dealer intangible assets on an accelerated basis. The change in the estimated useful life used to account for dealer intangibles resulted from our ongoing analysis of all pertinent factors, including actual customer attrition data, demand, competition, and the estimated technological life of the installed systems. The pertinent factors have been influenced by managements ongoing customer retention programs, as well as tactical and strategic initiatives to improve service delivery, customer satisfaction, and the credit worthiness of the subscriber customer base. 61 Attrition rates for customers in our ADT Worldwide business were 12.9%, 12.3% and 14.2% on a trailing 12 month basis for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Revenue Recognition Contract sales for the installation of fire protection systems, large security intruder systems and other construction related projects are recorded primarily under the percentage of completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related total cost of the project at completion. The risk of this methodology is its dependence upon estimates of costs at completion, which are subject to the uncertainties inherent in long term contracts. Revisions to cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits each period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they become determinable. If estimates are inaccurate, there is risk that our revenue and profits for the period may be overstated or understated. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other markets participants. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience and trend analysis. Loss Contingencies Accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings, self insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on judgment, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates. Additionally, the Company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. Income Taxes In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and international pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction. Any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. If a change in a valuation allowance occurs, which was established in connection with an acquisition, such adjustment may impact goodwill rather than the income tax provision. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and 62 other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If the tax liabilities relate to tax uncertainties existing at the date of the acquisition of a business, the adjustment of such tax liabilities will result in an adjustment to the goodwill recorded at the date of acquisition. Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually and more frequently if triggering events occur. In performing these assessments, management relies on various factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable transactions and other market data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment. Since judgment is involved in performing fair value measurements used in goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets impairment analyses, there is risk that the carrying values of our goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets may be overstated. We elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for all goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. When testing for goodwill impairment, the Company follows the guidance prescribed in SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." First, the Company compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. Fair value for the goodwill impairment test is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the Companys future budgets discounted using the Companys weighted average cost of capital and market indicators of terminal year cash flows. Other valuation methods are used to corroborate the discounted cash flow method. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered potentially impaired and further tests are performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. In the second step of the goodwill impairment test, the Company compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. The Company allocates the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill. Disruptions to our business such as end market conditions and protracted economic weakness, unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units, the divestiture of a significant component of a reporting unit and market capitalization declines may result in our having to perform a goodwill impairment first step valuation analysis for some or all of our reporting units prior to the required annual assessment. These types of events and the resulting analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future. In determining fair value, we rely on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgments in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. However, fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in the factors described above. In light of current economic conditions, additional impairments to one or more of our reporting units could occur in future periods whether or not connected to the 63 annual impairment analysis. We have certain reporting units which have limited excess of fair value over carrying value. The goodwill balance for reporting units with less than a ten percent excess of fair value over carrying value in the aggregate was approximately $2.4 billion at September 26, 2008. Goodwill impairments related to continuing operations were $9 million and $46 million during 2008 and 2007, respectively. There were no goodwill impairments related to continuing operations during 2006. We believe our goodwill balance at September 26, 2008 is recoverable. Indefinite lived intangible assets consisting primarily of trade names are tested for impairment using the relief from royalty method. The Company believes that its intangible assets balance at September 26, 2008 is recoverable. However, fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to change. In light of current economic conditions, impairments to intangible assets could occur in future periods. Long Lived Assets Assets held and used by the Company, including property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. Tyco performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if impairment exists. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, Tyco groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identified. If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Impairments to long lived assets to be disposed of are recorded based upon the fair value less cost to sell of the applicable assets. The calculation of the fair value of long lived assets is based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of long lived assets, there is a risk that the carrying value of our long lived assets may be overstated or understated. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations. Two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions. The discount rate represents the market rate for high quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our present value of pension obligations by approximately $76 million. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected long term rates of return on those types of plan assets, in determining the expected long term return on plan assets. A 50 basis point decrease in the expected long term return on plan assets would increase our pension expense by approximately $10 million. For fiscal 2009, we expect that recent reductions in the value of certain investments held by our pension plans will increase our pension expenses, which, although not currently expected, may result in a material impact on our obligation to fund these plans with cash.  Liquidity and Capital Resources Recent global market and economic conditions have been, and continue to be, disrupted and volatile having an adverse impact on financial markets in general. The volatility has reached unprecedented levels. As a result of concern about the stability of the markets and the strength of counterparties, many lenders and institutional investors have reduced and, in some cases, ceased to provide funding to borrowers resulting in severely diminished liquidity and credit availability. At this 64 time, the extent to which these conditions will persist is unclear. To date, the Companys cost and availability of funding has not been adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and we do not expect it to be materially impacted in the near future. We continue to have sufficient borrowing capacity for our foreseeable needs based on our current cash flow forecast. We currently have two syndicated multi year revolving credit facilities: a $1.25 billion facility maturing on April 25, 2012 and a $500 million facility maturing on June 24, 2011 with an aggregate commitment of $1.75 billion. On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. ("Lehman") filed a petition under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. Lehman is one of the lenders in our $1.25 billion revolving credit facility with a commitment of $60 million. Our $500 million credit facility did not have a commitment from Lehman. With the exception of the $60 million in commitments under our $1.25 billion facility, we believe that the lenders under our revolving credit facilities are capable of meeting any borrowing requests we may make. On September 25, 2008, we issued a borrowing request for $300 million under our $1.25 billion credit facility in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The Lehman portion of the commitment was not funded, resulting in a total funding of $286 million, which represented the total amount outstanding under our revolving credit facilities as of September 26, 2008. Based on our cash flow forecast, we believe we will continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs, even if Lehman remains unable or unwilling to participate or if another lender does not assume Lehmans commitment in the future. Our ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related cost of these borrowings, is affected by market conditions and our short term borrowing rating. As of June 27, 2008, we had outstanding commercial paper borrowings of $358 million, all of which were scheduled to mature during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. While the Company had the intent to refinance these outstanding borrowings through the commercial paper market, we have experienced limitations in our ability to access this market. As of September 26, 2008, we were successful in refinancing $116 million of the commercial paper outstanding as of June 27, 2008 with new commercial paper issuance. The remaining balance was refinanced under our $1.25 billion credit facility. Our multi year revolving credit facilities serve as a backstop to our commercial paper program. It is our intention to fund future maturities of commercial paper through new commercial paper issuances or additional borrowing from our credit facilities. As of November 12, 2008, $686 million was outstanding under our revolving credit facility. In addition to our available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of potential liquidity include committed credit lines, our commercial paper program, public debt and equity markets as well as the ability to sell trade accounts receivable. We continue to balance our cash operating, investing and financing uses of cash through investment in our existing core businesses, strategic acquisitions and divestitures, dividends and share repurchases. We believe our cash position, amounts available under our credit facilities and cash provided by operating activities will be adequate to cover our operational and business needs. As a result of declines experienced in global financial markets, our pension funds have and may continue to experience a negative return which will result in an increase in pension costs in 2009. We will continue to monitor the market conditions and assess the impact, if any, on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Approximately 100% of our U.S. and 97% of our non U.S. funded pension plans are invested in readily liquid investments, including equity and fixed income securities. Although we do not believe we will be required to make a material cash contribution in the next 12 months, if these 65 market conditions continue, we may be required to make incremental cash contributions under the Pension Protection Act in the U.S. or other local statutory law. The sources of our cash flow from operating activities and the use of a portion of that cash in our operations for the years ended September 26, 2008, September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006 were as follows ($ in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Cash flows from operating activities: Operating income (loss) $ 1,941 $ (1,732 ) $ 1,355 Goodwill impairment 9 46 Non cash restructuring and asset impairment charges, net 37 24 2 Losses on divestitures 4 2 Depreciation and amortization(1) 1,154 1,148 1,180 Non cash compensation expense 99 173 151 Deferred income taxes (94 ) (16 ) (413 ) Provision for losses on accounts receivable and inventory 135 94 55 Loss on the retirement of debt 258 259 1 Other, net (124 ) (231 ) (37 ) Class action settlement liability (3,020 ) 2,992 Net change in working capital (646 ) (414 ) 223 Interest income 110 104 46 Interest expense (396 ) (313 ) (279 ) Income tax expense (335 ) (324 ) (304 ) Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities $ (872 ) $ 1,814 $ 1,982 Other cash flow items: Capital expenditures, net(2) $ (706 ) $ (643 ) $ (517 ) Decrease in sale of accounts receivable 14 7 8 Acquisition of customer accounts (ADT dealer program) (376 ) (409 ) (373 ) Purchase accounting and holdback liabilities (2 ) (10 ) (7 ) Voluntary pension contributions 4 23 (1)Includes depreciation expense of $626 million, $635 million and $663 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and amortization of intangible assets of $528 million, $513 million and $517 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. (2)Includes net proceeds of $28 million, $23 million and $39 million received for the sale/disposition of property, plant and equipment in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The net change in working capital decreased operating cash flow by $646 million in 2008. The components of this change are set forth in detail in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The significant changes in working capital included a $176 million increase in accounts receivable, a $138 million increase in inventories, and a $152 million decrease in accrued and other liabilities, primarily due to accrued warranties. During the second quarter of 2008, Tyco released $2,960 million of funds placed in escrow during the third quarter of 2007 as well as $60 million of interest earned on those funds for the benefit of the class as stipulated in the Courts final order related to the class action settlement. During 2008, we substantially completed the sale of our Infrastructure Services business for net cash proceeds of $396 million, sold 100% of the stock of ETEO for $338 million in net cash proceeds, sold Ancon Building Products for $171 million in net cash proceeds, and completed the sale of NDC for $49 million in net cash proceeds. We continue to fund capital expenditures to improve the cost structure of our businesses, to invest in new processes and technology, and to maintain high quality production standards. The level of capital expenditures in 2009 is expected to exceed spending levels in 2008 of $734 million and is also expected to exceed depreciation of $626 million. 66 On July 10, 2008, Tycos Board of Directors approved a $1.0 billion share repurchase program under which we have repurchased 2.5 million common shares for $100 million. We also repurchased 23.1 million common shares for $944 million in 2008 completing the 2007 $1.0 billion share repurchase program. During 2007, we repurchased 1.3 million common shares for $56 million under the 2007 $1.0 billion share repurchase program as well as 5 million common shares for $659 million completing the 2006 $2.0 billion share repurchase program. During 2006, we repurchased 13 million common shares for $1.3 billion under the 2006 $2.0 billion share repurchase program as well as 11 million common shares for $1.2 billion completing the 2005 $1.5 billion share repurchase program. During the first quarter of 2007, we launched a company wide restructuring program, which as of September 26, 2008 has been substantially completed. Since the inception of this program, we have incurred charges of $395 million relating to this program. During 2008, 2007 and 2006 we paid out $187 million, $70 million and $32 million, respectively, in cash related to restructuring activities. We have identified additional opportunities for cost savings from restructuring activities in fiscal 2009 and expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately $50 million in fiscal 2009. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our restructuring activities. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, related to continuing operations was $501 million, $649 million, and $316 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, Tyco paid $376 million, $409 million and $373 million of cash, respectively, to acquire approximately 370,000, 415,000 and 401,000 customer contracts for electronic security services through the ADT dealer program. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, we paid $2 million, $10 million and $7 million, respectively, in cash for purchase accounting and holdback liabilities. Holdback liabilities represent a portion of the purchase price withheld from the seller pending finalization of the acquisition balance sheet and other contingencies. At September 26, 2008 holdback liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets were $18 million, which are included in other liabilities. At September 26, 2008, $12 million of acquisition liabilities remained on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, of which $3 million are included in accrued and other current liabilities and $9 million are included in other liabilities. As previously discussed, effective June 29, 2007, we completed the Separation. In connection with the Separation, we paid $68 million, $349 million and $96 million in Separation costs during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Of these amounts, $36 million, $256 million and $77 million were included in cash flows from discontinued operating activities, respectively. As previously discussed, we continue to be active in refining our portfolio and assessing the strategic fit of our various businesses. As a result, we will continue to divest of businesses that do not align with our overall strategy. We plan to use the expected proceeds from these sales, as well as the cash generated by our operations, to continue to make investments in our businesses that are intended to grow revenue and improve productivity, including our restructuring actions. We expect to also use cash to selectively pursue acquisitions. Additionally, we expect to continue to return any excess cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments. Pursuant to our share repurchase program, we may repurchase Tyco shares from time to time in open market purchases at prevailing market prices, in negotiated transactions off the market, or pursuant to an approved 10b5 1 trading plan in accordance with applicable regulations. Management believes that cash generated by or available to us should be sufficient to fund our capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future, including quarterly dividend payments. The Company intends to repurchase additional shares under its existing $1.0 billion share repurchase program depending on credit market conditions, macroeconomic factors and expectations regarding future cash flows. 67 Capitalization Shareholders equity was $15.5 billion or $32.41 per share, at September 26, 2008, compared to $15.6 billion or $31.50 per share, at September 28, 2007. Shareholders equity did not change significantly in 2008 due to net income of $1,553 million, which was offset by the repurchase of common shares by subsidiary of $854 million, the repurchase of common shares held in Treasury of $192 million, dividends declared of $313 million and foreign currency exchange rates of $307 million. Total debt was $4.3 billion at September 26, 2008, as compared to $4.5 billion at September 28, 2007. Total debt as a percentage of capitalization (total debt and shareholders equity) was 22% at both September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007, respectively. Our cash balance decreased to $1.5 billion at September 26, 2008, as compared to $1.9 billion at September 28, 2007. This decrease in cash was primarily due to the repurchase of common shares, capital expenditures, accounts purchased from the ADT dealer network, business acquisitions and dividends paid. This decrease was offset by cash generated by the operating segments and proceeds from divestitures. Debt Tenders In connection with the settlement of litigation arising from the Separation related to our public debt, on June 3, 2008 we, along with our finance subsidiary Tyco International Finance S.A. ("TIFSA"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and successor company to Tyco International Group S.A. ("TIGSA"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company organized under the laws of Luxembourg, consummated consent solicitations and exchange offers related to certain series of debt issued under the 1998 and 2003 indentures. In connection with the exchange offers, we issued $422 million principal amount of 7.0% notes due 2019 in exchange for an equal principal amount of 7.0% notes due 2028 and $707 million principal amount of 6.875% notes due 2021 in exchange for an equal principal amount of 6.875% notes due 2029. In connection with the consent solicitations, holders of our 6.0% notes due 2013, 6.125% notes due 2008, 6.125% notes due 2009, 6.75% notes due 2011, 6.375% notes due 2011, 7.0% notes due 2028 and 6.875% notes due 2029 collectively received consent payments totaling $250 million. The terms of the consent and exchange offers were evaluated as a debt modification in accordance with EITF No. 96 19, "Debtors Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of Debt Instruments," and it was determined that the 7.0% notes due 2028 and the 6.875% notes due 2029 were extinguished because the cash flows of the new bonds as compared to the original bonds were substantially modified. As a result, the new bonds and the 7.0% notes due 2028 and the 6.875% notes due 2029 that were not tendered for exchange were recorded at their fair value upon completion of the exchange offers. In determining fair value, we measured the bonds as if they were an initial issuance to the public. This was done by obtaining effective yield data derived from comparable pricing received from the issuance of bonds with similar ratings and covenants by large public companies. In connection with the consent solicitations and exchange offers, we recorded a $222 million charge to other expense, net as a loss on extinguishment of debt. This charge is comprised of the consent payments related to the extinguished bonds (notes due 2028 and 2029), premium on the exchanged bonds which represents the difference between the fair value and the book value of the extinguished bonds and the write off of the original unamortized debt issuance costs as well as fees paid to third parties associated with the bonds that were not deemed extinguished. The remaining portion of the consent payment and issuance costs will be amortized over the remaining life of the bonds. In May 2008, TIFSA commenced issuing commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are 68 available for general corporate purposes. As of September 26, 2008, TIFSA had $116 million of commercial paper outstanding, which bore interest at an average rate of 2.95%. During the year ended September 28, 2007, we recorded a $259 million charge to other expense, net for the loss on early extinguishment of debt related to the debt tender offers in connection with the Separation. Bank and Revolving Credit Facilities On June 24, 2008, Tyco and TIFSA entered into a $500 million senior unsecured revolving credit agreement with Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent for the lenders party thereto. This credit agreement has a three year term. Borrowings under this agreement have a variable interest rate based on LIBOR or an alternate base rate. The margin over LIBOR can vary based on changes in our credit rating and facility utilization. Together with the existing $1.25 billion five year senior revolving credit agreement, dated as of April 25, 2007, our total commitments under these facilities increased to $1.75 billion. These revolving credit facilities will be used for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes. As of September 26, 2008, there was $286 million drawn under these unsecured revolving credit facilities and as of November 12, 2008 we had $686 million outstanding. As discussed above, with the exception of the $60 million in commitments from Lehman, we believe that all of the lenders under our revolving credit facility are capable of meeting any borrowing requests TIFSA may make. On April 25, 2007, we, certain of our subsidiaries and a syndicate of banks entered into a 364 day unsecured bridge loan facility. On October 1, 2007, the commitments with respect to the unused portion of our unsecured bridge loan facility expired, but were subsequently renewed before being terminated in connection with the overall facilitys termination in June 2008. The unsecured bridge loan facility provided us with sufficient liquidity to repay our outstanding public debt with borrowings of up to $4.0 billion. The facility could only be used to repay, settle or otherwise extinguish such public debt, which was the subject of ongoing litigation between us and the trustee for such public debt. In June 2008, we settled this litigation and terminated this facility. In connection with the facility termination, we recorded a $36 million charge to other expense, net to write off unamortized debt issuance costs. On June 21, 2007, Tyco and TIFSA entered into a $500 million letter of credit facility, with Citibank N.A. as administrative agent, that was scheduled to expire on June 15, 2008. The facility provided for the issuance of letters of credit supported by a related line of credit facility. Effective June 6, 2008, this facility and all commitments under this facility were terminated. TIFSAs bank credit agreements contain customary terms and conditions, and financial covenants that limit the ratio of our debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and that limit our ability to incur subsidiary debt or grant liens on our property. Our indentures contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges, subsidiary debt and sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are considered restrictive to our business. Convertible Debentures As of September 28, 2007, TIFSA had $21 million outstanding of its 3.125% convertible senior debentures due 2023 with a 2015 put option ("the 3.125% convertible senior debentures"). On August 25, 2008, we delivered to holders a notice of redemption of our $19 million remaining principal amount of the 3.125% convertible senior debentures. These debentures were originally convertible into Tyco shares. As a result of the Separation transactions undertaken by us in 2007, these debentures became convertible into common shares of Tyco International Ltd., Covidien Ltd. and Tyco Electronics Ltd. The 3.125% convertible debentures were converted into 11.496 common shares of each of the three separate companies, per $1,000 principal amount. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, we issued 217,589 shares of Tyco common stock and obtained shares of Covidien Ltd. and Tyco Electronics in connection with the redemption of the 3.125% convertible senior debentures. 69 Additionally in the fourth quarter, we recorded a gain of $6 million upon exercise of the conversion option by holders (see Note 15 in the Consolidated Financial Statements). The last redemption date was September 25, 2008. Any notes outstanding after that date were redeemed with available cash. As of September 26, 2008, no amounts remain outstanding under the 3.125% convertible senior debentures. The following tables detail our long term and short term debt ratings at September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007: Long Term Debt Ratings 2008 2007 Moodys Baa1 Baa1 Standard & Poors BBB+ BBB Fitch BBB+ BBB Short Term Debt Ratings 2008 2007 Moodys P 2 N/A Standard & Poors A 2 N/A Fitch F2 N/A The security ratings set forth above are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.  Commitments and Contingencies Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations and commitments for principal debt, minimum lease payment obligations under non cancelable operating leases and other obligations at September 26, 2008 is as follows ($ in millions): 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Debt(1) $ 648 $ 1 $ 517 $ 1,135 $ 1 $ 1,831 $ 4,133 Interest payments(2) 225 209 192 148 120 619 1,513 Capital leases(3) 23 21 22 4 6 43 119 Operating leases 248 201 166 108 61 140 924 Purchase obligations(4) 53 3 56 Total contractual cash obligations(5)(6) $ 1,197 $ 435 $ 897 $ 1,395 $ 188 $ 2,633 $ 6,745 (1)Excludes debt discount and swap activity. Includes amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facilities. Included in the amount of debt maturing in 2009 is $116 million of commercial paper borrowings the Company classified as long term at September 26, 2008. This debt matures in 2009, but has been classified as long term on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as settlement of this debt is not expected to require the use of working capital in the next year and as the Company has both the intent and the ability to refinance this debt on a long term basis. (2)Interest payments consist of interest on our fixed interest rate debt and excludes interest on our variable interest rate debt. (3)Excludes interest. (4)Purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of good and services. (5)Other long term liabilities primarily consist of the following: pension and postretirement costs, income taxes, warranty and environmental liabilities and are excluded from this table. We are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type. The minimum required contributions to our pension plans are expected to be approximately $63 million in 2009 and we expect to pay $7 million in 2009 related to postretirement benefit plans. (6)During the first quarter of 2008, we adopted the provisions of FIN No. 48. As of September 26, 2008, we recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $369 million and gross interest and penalties of $49 million, both of which are classified as non current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as payment is not expected within one year. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing for such payments in future years; therefore, such amounts have been excluded from the above contractual obligation table. 70 Our 6.125% public notes due in 2008 and 2009 of $300 million and $215 million mature in the first and second quarter of fiscal year 2009, respectively. Based on market conditions and our liquidity needs, we intend to pay down these maturities of such debt either by drawing down on our existing credit facility or accessing the debt market on terms that are acceptable to the Company. As of November 12, 2008, the total outstanding balance under our credit facility was $686 million. On June 24, 2008, Tyco and TIFSA entered into a new $500 million senior unsecured revolving credit agreement with Citibank, N.A. as administrative agent for the lenders party therto. This credit agreement has a three year term. Borrowings under this agreement have a variable interest rate based on LIBOR or an alternate base rate. The margin over LIBOR can vary based on changes in our credit rating and facility utilization. Together with the existing $1.25 billion five year senior revolving credit agreement, dated as of April 25, 2007, our total commitments under these facilities increased to $1.75 billion. As discussed above, as of September 26, 2008, we had total commitments of $1.75 billion under our revolving credit facilities, $500 million of which matures on June 24, 2011 and $1.25 billion of which matures on April 25, 2012. Additionally, $60 million worth of commitments under our $1.25 billion facility are held by Lehman which has defaulted on it obligations under the agreement. As of September 26, 2008, $286 million was outstanding under our revolving credit facilities, and as of November 12, 2008, $686 million was outstanding. At September 26, 2008, we had total outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees of $633 million. In May 2008, TIFSA commenced issuing commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes. As of September 26, 2008, TIFSA had $116 million of commercial paper outstanding which bore interest at an average rate of 2.95%. At September 26, 2008 we classified $116 million of short term borrowings as long term. Settlement of this debt is not expected to require the use of working capital in the next year, as we have both the intent and the ability to refinance this debt on a long term basis. In the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In connection with the Separation, we entered into a liability sharing agreement regarding certain class actions that were pending against Tyco prior to the Separation. Under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, we, Covidien and Tyco Electronics are jointly and severally liable for the full amount of any judgments resulting from the actions subject to the agreement, which generally relate to legacy claims (including ERISA, FCPA and securities claims). The Separation and Distribution Agreement also provides that we will be responsible for 27%, Covidien 42% and Tyco Electronics 31% of payments to resolve these matters, with costs and expenses associated with the management of these contingencies being shared equally among the parties. In addition, under the agreement, we will manage and control all the legal matters related to assumed contingent liabilities as described in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, including the defense or settlement thereof, subject to certain limitations. 71  Tyco has assumed 27%, Covidien has assumed 42% and Tyco Electronics has assumed 31% of certain Tyco pre Separation contingent and other corporate liabilities, which include securities class action litigation, Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA") class action litigation, certain legacy tax contingencies and any actions with respect to the spin offs or the distributions made or brought by any third party. Any amounts relating to these contingent and other corporate liabilities paid by Tyco after the spin offs that are subject to the allocation provisions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement will be shared among Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics pursuant to the same allocation ratio. As described in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Tyco, Tyco Electronics and Covidien are jointly and severally liable for all amounts relating to the previously disclosed securities class action settlement. All costs and expenses that Tyco incurs in connection with the defense of such litigation, other than the amount of any judgment or settlement, which will be allocated in the manner described above, will be borne equally by Covidien, Tyco Electronics and Tyco. Legal Matters Class Actions For a discussion of contingencies related to Tycos securities class actions, class action settlement, ERISA related litigation and Tyco litigation against former senior management, litigation related to our public debt and various other legal matters, see Item 3, Legal Proceedings. We are generally obligated to indemnify our directors and officers and our former directors and officers who are named as defendants in some or all of these matters to the extent required by Bermuda law. While we may from time to time seek to engage plaintiffs counsel in settlement discussions, we are unable at this time to estimate what our ultimate liability in these matters may be, and it is possible that we will be required to pay judgments or settlements and incur expenses, in excess of any insurance coverage, in aggregate amounts that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Investigations For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to governmental investigations related to Tyco, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Subpoenas and Document Requests From Governmental Entities. We cannot predict when these investigations will be completed, nor can we predict what the results of these investigations may be. It is possible that we will be required to pay material fines, consent to injunctions on future conduct, lose the ability to conduct business with government entities or instrumentalities (which in turn could negatively impact our business with non governmental customers) or suffer other penalties or adverse impacts, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. It is not possible to estimate the amount of loss, or range of possible loss, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters. Environmental Matters Tyco is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos environmental matters, see Item 1. Business Environmental Matters and Item 3. Legal Proceedings Environmental Matters. Asbestos Matters Tyco and some of its subsidiaries are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials. For a detailed discussion of Tycos contingencies related to these matters, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Asbestos Matters. 72 Income Taxes Tyco and its subsidiaries income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. The Company is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest have been assessed under FIN 48 and recorded as appropriate. For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos income taxes, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Income Tax Matters. Compliance Matters Tyco has received and responded to various allegations and other information that improper activities were conducted by Tyco employees in recent years, in particular with respect to DOJ and SEC investigations that have resulted in our performing a company wide baseline review of our policies, controls and practices as they relate to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. For a detailed discussion of these contingencies and others related to Tycos compliance efforts, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Compliance Matters. Other Matters The Company is a defendant in a number of other pending legal proceedings incidental to present and former operations, acquisitions and dispositions. The Company does not expect the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Backlog At September 26, 2008, we had a backlog of unfilled orders of $9.7 billion, compared to a backlog of $9.0 billion at September 28, 2007. We expect that approximately 86% of our backlog at September 26, 2008 will be filled during 2009. Backlog by segment at September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007 is as follows ($ in millions): 2008 2007 ADT Worldwide $ 6,177 $ 6,137 Flow Control 2,083 1,579 Fire Protection Services 1,139 1,048 Electrical and Metal Products 117 114 Safety Products 154 132 $ 9,670 $ 9,010 Within ADT Worldwide, backlog increased primarily as a result of recurring revenue in force, which represents 12 months fees for monitoring and maintenance services under contract in the security business. Our total account base grew 1.6% year over year to 7.2 million accounts. The amount of recurring revenue in force at September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007 was $3.97 billion and $3.93 billion, respectively. Flow Control had increased bookings mostly in the Asia Pacific and Americas regions. Backlog within Fire Protection Services increased primarily as a result of increased orders in Asia and North America. 73  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale of Accounts Receivable Certain of Tycos international businesses utilize the sale of accounts receivable as short term financing mechanisms. The aggregate amount outstanding under the Companys remaining international accounts receivable programs was $65 million, $76 million and $75 million at September 26, 2008, September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006, respectively. Guarantees Certain of the Companys business segments have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from 2008 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. There are certain guarantees or indemnifications extended among Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics in accordance with the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Tax Sharing Agreement. The guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the Tax Sharing Agreement. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Tax Sharing Agreement. At the time of the Separation, Tyco recorded a liability necessary to recognize the fair value of such guarantees and indemnifications in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation ("FIN") No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." In the absence of observable transactions for identical or similar guarantees, the Company determined the fair value of these guarantees and indemnifications utilizing expected present value measurement techniques. Significant assumptions utilized to determine fair value included determining a range of potential outcomes, assigning a probability weighting to each potential outcome and estimating the anticipated timing of resolution. The probability weighted outcomes were discounted using the Companys incremental borrowing rate. The liability necessary to reflect the fair value of the guarantees and indemnifications under the Tax Sharing Agreement is $554 million and $543 million, which is included in other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007, respectively. The guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the Tax Sharing Agreement. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Tax Sharing Agreement. In addition, Tyco historically provided support in the form of financial and or performance guarantees to various Covidien and Tyco Electronics operating entities. In connection with the Separation, the Company worked with the guarantee counterparties to cancel or assign these guarantees to Covidien or Tyco Electronics. To the extent these guarantees were not assigned prior to the Separation date, Tyco assumed primary liability on any remaining support. The estimated fair values of those obligations are $7 million, which are included in other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and were recorded in accordance with FIN No. 45 with an offset to shareholders equity on the Separation date. In disposing of assets or businesses, the Company often provides representations, warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. The Company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 74  The Company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. In the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company records estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. For further information on estimated product warranty, see Notes 1 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2001, a division of Safety Products initiated a Voluntary Replacement Program ("VRP") associated with the acquisition of Central Sprinkler. The VRP relates to the replacement of certain O ring seal sprinkler heads which were originally manufactured by Central Sprinkler prior to Tycos acquisition. Under this program, the sprinkler heads are being replaced free of charge to property owners. In the third quarter of 2006, the Company completed a comprehensive review of reported claims, recent claim rates and cost trends and further assessed the future of the program. The Company determined that an additional liability was necessary in order to satisfy the Companys obligation under the VRP. As a result, the Company recorded a $100 million charge which was reflected in cost of sales. On May 1, 2007, the Consumer Products Safety Commission and the Company announced an August 31, 2007 deadline for filing claims to participate in the VRP. The Company will fulfill all valid claims for replacement of qualifying sprinklers received up to August 31, 2007. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company further assessed the expected cost to complete the program in light of the most current claims data and determined that an additional accrual of $10 million was necessary to satisfy the estimated remaining obligation. The ultimate cost to complete the program will be impacted by a number of factors such as changes in material and labor costs, and the actual number of sprinkler heads replaced. Actual results could differ from this estimate. Settlements during 2008 include cash expenditures of $49 million related to the VRP.  Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation ("FIN") No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109." This Interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. FIN No. 48 became effective for Tyco in the first quarter of 2008. As a result of adopting FIN No. 48, Tyco increased its reserve for uncertain tax positions by $55 million and reduced its deferred tax assets by $24 million with a corresponding $79 million cumulative effect adjustment to shareholders equity. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the adoption of FIN No. 48. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In May 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 162, "The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles" (SFAS No. 162). SFAS No. 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements. SFAS No. 162 is effective 60 days following the SECs approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411, "The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles". The Company does not expect that this standard will have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In April 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position ("FSP") No. 142 3, "Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets". FSP No. 142 3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset 75 under SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets". FSP No. 142 3 is effective for Tyco in the first quarter of 2010. The Company is currently assessing the impact of FSP No. 142 3 on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, "Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS No. 161 is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entitys results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 161 are effective for Tyco in the second quarter of 2009. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 141 (Revised 2007), "Business Combinations." SFAS No. 141R retains the underlying concepts of SFAS No. 141 in that business combinations are still accounted for at fair value. However, the accounting for certain other aspects of business combinations will be affected. Acquisition costs will generally be expensed as incurred. Restructuring costs associated with a business combination will generally be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date. In process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible at the acquisition date until it is completed or abandoned and its useful life can be determined. Changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions after the acquisition date will generally impact income tax expense. SFAS No. 141R also expands required disclosures surrounding the nature and financial effects of business combinations. SFAS No. 141R is effective, on a prospective basis, for Tyco in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51". SFAS No. 160 requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest (minority interest prior to the adoption of SFAS 160) as equity in the consolidated financial statements. The amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest should be included in consolidated net income on the face of the statement of income. SFAS No. 160 also amends certain of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51s consolidation procedures in order to achieve consistency with the requirements of SFAS No. 141R. The statement also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest. This statement is effective for Tyco in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The Company is currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 160 on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities." SFAS No. 159 permits an entity, on a contract by contract basis, to make an irrevocable election to account for certain types of financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value, rather than historical cost, with changes in the fair value, whether realized or unrealized, recognized in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for Tyco in the first quarter of 2009. The Company is currently assessing the impact that SFAS No. 159 will have on the results of its operations, financial position or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements," which enhances existing guidance for measuring assets and liabilities at fair value. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 157 1, "Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB Statement No. 13 and Other Accounting Pronouncements That Address Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease Classification or Measurement under Statement 13", to exclude SFAS No, 13, "Accounting for Leases" and other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements for purposes of lease classification or measurement under SFAS No. 13, and FASB Staff Position No. 157 2, "Effective Date of FASB Statement No 157" that permits companies to partially defer the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for one year for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 157 3, "Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active", clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157 for a financial 76 asset in an in active market. During the first quarter of 2009 the Company elected to defer the adoption of SFAS No. 157 for one year for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. SFAS No. 157 is effective for Tyco in the first quarter of 2009. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, that SFAS No. 157 will have on the results of its operations, financial position or cash flows. In September 2006, FASB issued SFAS No. 158, "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)." SFAS No. 158 requires that employers recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as a net asset or liability on the balance sheet and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. The company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158 as of September 28, 2007. SFAS No. 158 also requires companies to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of their fiscal year end. The Company presently uses a measurement date of August 31st. The measurement date provisions become effective in fiscal 2009. The Company is currently assessing the impact that SFAS No. 158 measurement date provisions will have on the results of its operations, financial position or cash flows. In June 2008 the FASB ratified FASB Staff Position No. EITF 03 6 1, "Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions are Participating Securities" (FSP No. EITF 03 6 1), which addresses whether instruments granted in share based payment awards are participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, must be included in the earnings allocation in calculating earnings per share under the two class method described in SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per Share" (SFAS No. 128). FSP No. EITF 03 6 1 requires that unvested share based payment awards that contain non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents be treated as participating securities in calculating earnings per share. FSP No. EITF 03 6 1 is effective for Tyco in fiscal 2010 and interim periods within those fiscal years, and shall be applied retrospectively to all prior periods. We are currently evaluating the effects, if any that FSP No. EITF 03 6 1 may have on earnings per share.  Forward Looking Information Certain statements in this report are "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. All statements contained herein that are not clearly historical in nature are forward looking, and the words "anticipate," "believe," "expect," "estimate," "project" and similar expressions are generally intended to identify forward looking statements. Any forward looking statement contained herein, in press releases, written statements or other documents filed with the Security and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), or in Tycos communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, web casts, phone calls and conference calls, regarding expectations with respect to sales, earnings, cash flows, operating efficiencies, product expansion, backlog, the consummation and benefits of acquisitions and divestitures, as well as financings and repurchases of debt or equity securities, are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and contingencies. Many of these risks, uncertainties and contingencies are beyond our control, and may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from anticipated results, performance or achievements. Factors that might affect such forward looking statements include, among other things: overall economic and business conditions; the demand for Tycos goods and services; competitive factors in the industries in which Tyco competes; 77 changes in tax requirements (including tax rate changes, new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations); results and consequences of Tycos internal investigation and governmental investigations concerning the Companys governance, management, internal controls and operations including its business operations outside the United States; the outcome of litigation and governmental proceedings; effect of income tax audit settlements; the ratings on our debt and our ability to repay or refinance our outstanding indebtedness as it matures; our ability to operate within the limitations imposed by financing arrangements and to maintain our credit ratings; interest rate fluctuations and other changes in borrowing costs; other capital market conditions, including availability of funding sources and currency exchange rate fluctuations; availability of and fluctuations in the prices of key raw materials, including steel and copper; economic and political conditions in international markets, including governmental changes and restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders; the ability to achieve cost savings in connection with the Companys strategic restructuring and Six Sigma initiatives; potential further impairment of our goodwill and or our long lived assets; the impact of fluctuations in the price of Tyco common shares; changes in U.S. and non U.S. governmental laws and regulations; and the possible effects on Tyco of future legislation in the United States that may limit or eliminate potential U.S. tax benefits resulting from Tycos incorporation in Bermuda or deny U.S. government contracts to Tyco based upon its incorporation in Bermuda.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the ordinary course of conducting business, we are exposed to certain risks associated with potential changes in market conditions. These risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Accordingly, we have established a comprehensive risk management process to monitor, evaluate and manage the principal exposures we believe we are subject to. We seek to manage these risks through the use of financial derivative instruments. Our portfolio of derivative financial instruments may, from time to time, include forward foreign currency exchange contracts, cross currency swaps, foreign currency options, and interest rate swaps. Derivative financial instruments related to interest rate sensitivity of debt obligations, intercompany cross border transactions and anticipated non functional currency cash flows are used with the goal of mitigating a significant portion of these exposures when it is cost effective to do so. We do not execute transactions or utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, to reduce the risk that a counterparty will be unable to honor its contractual obligations to us, we only enter into contracts with counterparties having at least an A/A2 long term debt rating. These counterparties are generally financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one party. During fiscal year 2007, the Company elected to change its presentation of market risk information from a tabular format to a disclosure based on the results of sensitivity analysis. Management believes this method of presentation provides more useful information for assessing the Companys overall 78 exposure to market risks. The results of our sensitivity analysis represent an estimate of reasonably possible outcomes based on hypothetical market conditions and are not necessarily indicative of actual results. Foreign Currency Exposures We hedge our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts and options. During 2008, our largest exposures to foreign exchange rates existed primarily with the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar against the U.S. Dollar. The market risk related to the forward foreign exchange contracts is measured by estimating the potential impact of a 10% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates. The rates used to perform this analysis were based on the market rates in effect on September 26, 2008. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in a $57 million net increase in the fair value of the contracts. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in a $69 million net decrease in the fair value of the contracts. However, gains or losses on these derivative instruments are economically offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. Previously, we hedged our investment in certain foreign operations. In December 2006, due to required changes to the legal entity structure to facilitate the Separation, the Company determined that it would no longer consider certain intercompany foreign currency transactions to be long term investments. As a result, the related foreign currency transaction gains and losses on such investments were recorded in the income statement subsequent to this determination rather than in the currency translation component of shareholders equity. Forward contracts that were previously designated as hedges of these net investments continued to be used to manage this exposure but were no longer designated as net investment hedges. Also in connection with the Separation and the debt tender, the Company re designated its 6.125% Euro denominated public notes due 2007 on March 29, 2007, its 5.5% Euro denominated public notes due 2008 and its 6.5% British Pound denominated public notes due 2031 on May 21, 2007, that had previously been considered as hedges of net investments in certain foreign operations. At September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007, the Company did not hedge its net investment in foreign operations, we had no net investment hedges and all of its outstanding borrowings were denominated in U.S. dollars. During 2008, we designated certain intercompany loans as permanent in nature, in the amount of $2.1 billion as of September 26, 2008. As a result, the Company recorded $141 million of cumulative translation adjustment through accumulated other comprehensive income as of September 26, 2008 related to these loans. Interest Rate Exposures Our long term debt portfolio primarily consists of fixed rate instruments. Historically, the Company managed its exposure to interest rates by entering into interest rate and cross currency swaps designated as fair value hedges. In assessing the potential risks related to movements in interest rates, we terminated the interest rate and cross currency swaps in several tranches beginning in the fourth quarter of 2006. During the first quarter of 2007, we terminated the remaining contracts with a total notional amount of $0.6 billion, resulting in an aggregate terminated notional amount of $3.1 billion. The settlement of these swaps resulted in a net cash inflow of $63 million for the first quarter of 2007. Since the interest rate swaps were designated as hedging instruments of outstanding debt, the related $32 million loss adjustment reported in 2007 to the carrying value of the related debt will be amortized over the remaining life of the related debt instruments. Of this amount, $3 million and $18 million have been amortized in 2008 and 2007, respectively. In connection with the debt tender offer, $9 million of unamortized loss on interest rate swaps was accelerated and recorded in 2007 as a loss on retirement of debt and included in other expense, net (see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial 79 Statements). At September 28, 2007, there were no interest rate swaps outstanding. During 2008, the Company did not enter into any interest rate or cross currency swaps, but may consider such strategies in the future. Commodity Exposures We are exposed to volatility in the prices of raw materials used in some of our products and may, in limited circumstances, enter into hedging contracts to manage those exposures. These exposures are monitored as an integral part of our risk management program. During 2008, the Company did not hedge its exposure attributable to changes in commodity prices but may consider such strategies in the future.  
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the Selected Financial Data and our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those under the headings "Risk Factors" and "Forward Looking Information." Introduction The Consolidated Financial Statements include the consolidated results of Tyco International Ltd., a company organized under the laws of Bermuda, and its subsidiaries (hereinafter collectively referred to as "we," the "Company" or "Tyco") and have been prepared in United States dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Company operates in the following business segments: ADT Worldwide designs, sells, installs, services and monitors electronic security systems for residential, commercial, industrial and governmental customers. Flow Control designs, manufactures, sells and services valves, pipes, fittings, valve automation and heat tracing products for the water and wastewater markets, the oil, gas and other energy markets along with general process industries. Fire Protection Services designs, sells, installs and services fire detection and fire suppression systems for commercial, industrial and governmental customers. Electrical and Metal Products designs, manufactures and sells galvanized steel tubing, armored wire and cable and other metal products for non residential construction, electrical, fire and safety and mechanical customers. Safety Products designs, manufactures and sells fire protection, security and life safety products, including fire suppression products, breathing apparatus, intrusion security, access control and video management systems. In addition, Safety Products manufactures products installed and serviced by ADT Worldwide and Fire Protection Services. We also provide general corporate services to our segments and these costs are reported as Corporate and Other. References to the segment data are to the Companys continuing operations. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to exclude the results of discontinued operations. Overview and Outlook Fiscal year 2008 was a year of progress for Tyco, as revenue increased by 9% and income from continuing operations significantly improved compared to 2007. We also made significant progress in executing our business strategies. Looking forward to fiscal 2009, like most businesses, we expect market conditions to negatively affect our results. First, because over 50% of our revenue is generated outside of the U.S., the recent significant appreciation of the U.S. dollar against most major currencies could negatively impact our revenue in 2009. Specifically, the value of the local currencies used in our non U.S. operations has declined relative to the U.S. dollar by approximately 20%, mostly during the fourth fiscal quarter and into October of 2008. If exchange rates remained at these levels, our non U.S. revenue would likely decline by a similar magnitude in fiscal 2009. Second, we expect the operating margins in our Electrical and Metals segment to decline in 2009 as a result of declining steel and 39 copper prices. As noted in our Critical Accounting Policies, we account for our inventory on a first in, first out basis. As a result, in a declining price environment like the one we are in today, operating margins are likely to contract as higher priced inventory is processed and sold at lower prices. Third, we have recently seen a decline in commercial construction activity, both in the United Kingdom and the U.S. We expect continued weakness in the commercial construction market to negatively impact our results in the ADT Worldwide segment. Operationally, in 2009, we expect to continue our initiatives to improve our efficiency, manage our working capital effectively, refine our portfolio and prudently allocate our capital. We expect internal investments to fund growth and productivity in our businesses to continue to be our first priority. As in prior years, we expect to remain active in making bolt on acquisitions as we continually assess the strategic fit and value of businesses that have potential for success within our existing framework. During 2008, our ADT Worldwide segment acquired FirstService Security to strengthen its systems integration capabilities. In addition, during 2008, ADT acquired two Sensormatic franchisees: Winner Security Services LLC and Sensormatic Security Corp. At the same time that we selectively pursue acquisitions, we will consider divestitures where businesses do not align with our long term strategy. In fiscal 2008, as part of our portfolio refinement efforts, we sold a subsidiary that makes and sells fire protection products in Japan, a European manufacturer of building products for the construction industry, a European manufacturer of public address and acoustic systems, and substantially all of our Infrastructure Services business. These divestitures resulted in cash proceeds of approximately $1.0 billion. The results of these businesses are included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. In addition to using cash flow to fund internal investments and make selective acquisitions, we expect to have excess cash to return to our shareholders. During 2008, we completed the $1.0 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in September 2007, which resulted in the purchase of approximately 5% of our outstanding shares during the program. In addition, during 2008, we paid dividends of $292 million to shareholders, and on September 9, 2008 our Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend on our common shares to $0.20 per share from $0.15 per share, which was paid on November 3, 2008 to shareholders of record on October 1, 2008. On July 10, 2008, our Board of Directors approved a new $1.0 billion share repurchase program, which we intend to use to repurchase additional shares depending on credit market conditions, macroeconomic factors and our expectations regarding future cash flows. Finally, we continue to focus on operational execution to drive earnings growth. To further improve operating efficiency, during the first quarter of 2007, we launched a restructuring program across all of our segments, including the corporate organization, designed to streamline some of our businesses and reduce our operational footprint. Since the inception of this program through the end of fiscal 2008, we have incurred charges of approximately $395 million. We have identified additional opportunities for cost savings from restructuring activities in fiscal 2009 and expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately $50 million in fiscal 2009. We believe this restructuring activity will strengthen our competitive position over the long term. Legal Settlements In connection with the settlement of litigation related to our outstanding public debt, on June 3, 2008 we, along with our finance subsidiary TIFSA, Tyco International Finance S.A. ("TIFSA"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and successor company to Tyco International Group S.A. ("TIGSA"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company organized under the laws of Luxembourg, consummated consent solicitations and exchange offers related to certain series of debt issued under the Companys consent payments totaling $250 million, and we recorded a $222 million charge to other expense, net as a loss on extinguishment of debt. We also terminated our unsecured bridge loan facility entered into on November 27, 2007 in connection with the settlement of the Indenture Trustee 40 Litigation and recorded a $36 million charge to other expense to write off unamortized debt issuance costs. During the third quarter of 2008, the Company signed a definitive agreement with the plaintiff to settle the lawsuit entitled New Jersey v. Tyco International Ltd., et al. In connection with the settlement, the Company made a payment of $73.25 million to the plaintiffs on June 2, 2008. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Companys share of the settlement amount was approximately $20 million, with Covidien and Tyco Electronics responsible for approximately $30 million and $23 million, respectively. The Company recorded the settlement and related receivable from each of Covidien and Tyco Electronics for their respective shares of the settlement amount in the second quarter of 2008 resulting in a net charge to selling, general and administrative expenses for its share of the settlement of approximately $20 million. Also in the third quarter of 2008, the Company settled the lawsuit entitled Ballard v. Tyco International Ltd. Pursuant to the settlement, the Company made a payment of $36 million to the plaintiffs, which was subject to the sharing formula contained in the Separation and Distribution Agreement and resulted in the Company recording a net charge to selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately $10 million and recording receivables from Tyco Electronics and Covidien of approximately $11 million and $15 million, respectively, in the third quarter. Also in the third quarter of 2008, the Company settled the matter entitled The Bank of New York v. Tyco International Group S.A., a lawsuit related to the Separation brought by the indenture trustee of certain of Tycos public debt. In connection with the settlement, Tyco exchanged approximately $422 million principal amount of notes due 2028 and $707 million principal amount of notes due 2029 for an equal principal amount of notes due 2019 and 2021, respectively. The terms of the exchange notes are substantially the same as the terms of the notes for which they were exchanged. In addition, each series of notes issued under Tycos indentures dated June 9, 1998 and December 31, 2003 (including the exchange notes) were amended to provide noteholders with the right to require Tyco to repurchase their notes for a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase, in the event that a ratings downgrade occurs in connection with certain change of control transactions. Also in the third quarter of 2008, the Company settled the matter entitled Sensormatic Security Corp. v. Sensormatic Electronics Corp., ADT Security Services, Inc. and Wallace Computer Services, Inc. in connection with its purchase of the Sensormatic franchisees Maryland, Virginia and District of Columbia franchise. As part of the settlement and the franchise acquisition, the Company paid a total of approximately $86 million to the franchisee which includes $20 million for the reacquisition of franchise rights that were deemed unfavorable to the Company when compared to pricing for current market transactions for similar arrangements and $6 million related to a legal settlement. In the second quarter of 2008, the Company settled a contract dispute arising under its former Infrastructure Services business relating to the City of Phoenixs 91st Avenue Wastewater Treatment Plant. The settlement included a general release of all claims by each party to the litigation without any party making any payment to any other party. In connection with the settlement, the Company assessed its assets under the original contract with the City of Phoenix and concluded the assets were no longer recoverable, resulting in a $51 million charge to discontinued operations in the second quarter of 2008. In 2007, the Company settled 32 purported securities class action lawsuits arising from actions alleged to have been taken by prior management for $2.975 billion. Of this amount, the Company contributed $803 million, representing its share under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, to a $2.975 billion escrow account established in connection with the settlement. All legal contingencies that could have affected the final order approving the settlement expired on February 21, 2008, and the claims administrator is currently processing claims. The settlement did not purport to resolve all securities cases, and several of such cases remain outstanding. In addition, the settlement did not 41 release claims arising under ERISA and the lawsuits arising thereunder. As of the opt out deadline, Tyco had received opt out notices from individuals and entities totaling approximately 4% of the shares owned by class members. A number of these individuals and entities have filed claims separately against Tyco. Any judgments resulting from such claims or from claims that are filed in the future would not reduce the settlement amount. Generally, the claims asserted by these plaintiffs include claims similar to those asserted by the settling defendants; namely, violations of the disclosure provisions of federal securities laws. Tyco intends to vigorously defend any litigation resulting from opt out claims. It is not possible to predict the final outcome or to estimate the amount of loss or range of possible loss, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of the asserted or unasserted claims from individuals that have opted out or from any other legacy securities litigation. Should any of these cases result in an adverse judgment or be settled for a significant amount, they could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Under the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, each of Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics are jointly and severally liable for the full amount of any legacy securities action settlement (including ERISA claims) and any judgments resulting from opt out claims. Additionally, under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the companies shared in the liability and escrow accounts related to the class action settlement, with Tyco assuming 27%, Covidien 42% and Tyco Electronics 31% of the settlement amount. As a result, Tyco incurred a charge to expense, for which no tax benefit is available, and a current liability of $2.975 billion in the third quarter of 2007. Tyco borrowed under its unsecured bridge and credit facilities to fund the liability and placed the proceeds in escrow for the benefit of the class. In connection with the Separation, Covidien and Tyco Electronics assumed their portion of the related borrowing. The Company has also recovered certain of these costs from insurers. As a result, the Company recorded $113 million of recoveries in connection with the class action settlement in its Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2007. Based on the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Company recorded payables to Covidien and Tyco Electronics for their portion of the 2007 recoveries with an offset to shareholders equity. The Company recovered an additional $38 million of costs from insurers during 2008. The Company recorded payables to Covidien and Tyco Electronics for their respective shares of the 2008 recoveries resulting in a net $10 million credit recorded to class action settlement, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Since all legal contingencies that could have affected the settlement were exhausted on February 21, 2008, the administration and distribution of the settlement funds in escrow has been managed by the counsel of the certified class and Tyco is not subject to any further liability related to the class action settlement. As a result, Tyco has extinguished the class action liability and no longer has claim to the escrow account. The escrow accounts earned interest that was payable to the class. As a result, interest was also accrued on the class action settlement liability. On February 21, 2008, the class action liability and escrow account balances including interest were each $3.02 billion. Based on the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Tyco had a receivable from Covidien and Tyco Electronics for their portion of the liability of $1,257 million and $927 million, respectively at September 28, 2007 and corresponding payables to Covidien and Tyco Electronics for their interest in the escrow accounts. Receivables and payables that pertain to the class action settlement and related escrow accounts with the same counterparty were presented net in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Tycos portion of the liability was $808 million at September 28, 2007. These amounts were extinguished during the second quarter of 2008. 42 Operating Results Net revenue, operating income (loss) and net income (loss) for the years ended September 26, 2008, September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006 were as follows ($ in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Revenue from product sales $ 13,064 $ 11,816 $ 10,731 Service revenue 7,135 6,661 6,335 Net revenue $ 20,199 $ 18,477 $ 17,066 Operating income (loss) $ 1,941 $ (1,732 ) $ 1,355 Interest income 110 104 46 Interest expense (396 ) (313 ) (279 ) Other expense, net (224 ) (255 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest 1,431 (2,196 ) 1,122 Income taxes (335 ) (324 ) (304 ) Minority interest (1 ) (4 ) (1 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations 1,095 (2,524 ) 817 Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes 458 782 2,787 Income (loss) before cumulative effect of accounting change 1,553 (1,742 ) 3,604 Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of income taxes (14 ) Net income (loss) $ 1,553 $ (1,742 ) $ 3,590 Net revenue increased $1.7 billion, or 9.3%, for 2008 as compared to 2007 as a result of growth in all of our segments led by solid year over year increases in Flow Control, ADT Worldwide and Electrical and Metal Products. The increase in net revenue in Flow Control resulted from volume growth due to continued strength in most industrial end markets with significant project growth in the valves business. In addition, net revenue growth in ADT Worldwide was attributable to growth in all geographic regions, as well as growth in its North American recurring revenue base. Electrical and Metal Products experienced growth primarily due to selling price increases partially offset by a decrease in volume. Foreign currency exchange rates positively affected 2008 by $772 million while the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other activity positively affected 2008 by $35 million. Operating income increased $3.7 billion for 2008. Operating loss in 2007 included the class action settlement charge of $2.862 billion while 2008 operating income included a class action benefit of $10 million. Strong year over year income growth in all segments led by Flow Control, ADT Worldwide and Electrical and Metal Products, as well as lower corporate expenses contributed to the increase in operating income. Operating income was also favorably impacted as a result of lower Separation related costs and goodwill impairment charges. Separation related costs impacted operating income by $4 million and $105 million and goodwill impairment charges impacted operating income by $9 million and $46 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Additionally, operating income was negatively impacted by restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net of $248 million for 2008 and $210 million for 2007. Net revenue increased $1.4 billion, or 8.3%, for 2007 as compared to 2006 as a result of growth in all of our segments. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by Flow Control as a result of volume growth from continued strength in most industrial end markets. In addition, ADT Worldwide had strong growth in Asia and Latin America, as well as growth in its recurring revenue base and systems installation and service in North America. Fire Protection Services experienced continued growth in electronic and mechanical contracting. Foreign currency exchange rates positively affected 2007 by $580 million while the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures negatively affected 2007 by $48 million. 43 Operating income decreased $3.1 billion for 2007. Operating income was primarily impacted by the class action settlement charge, net of $2.862 billion. Revenue growth in all segments was partially offset by lower margins in Electrical and Metal Products primarily due to unfavorable spreads on both steel and copper products. Additionally, operating income was impacted by costs incurred relating to the Separation and the restructuring program announced in November 2006. Separation related costs impacted operating income by $105 million for 2007 and $49 million for 2006. Restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net impacted operating income by $210 million and $15 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Also impacting operating income was a goodwill impairment charge of $46 million due to the reorganization into our new management and segment reporting structure. In addition, 2006 was unfavorably affected by a $100 million charge relating to a pre existing voluntary replacement program for certain sprinkler heads, incremental stock option charges of $84 million as required under SFAS No. 123R, "Share Based Payment," and separation related costs of $49 million. Operating income for 2006 also included $72 million of income related to the extinguishment of certain payment obligations under a split dollar life insurance policy and rabbi trust pursuant to a settlement with Mr. Kozlowski, former Chief Executive Officer, and $48 million of income resulting from a reduction in our estimated workers compensation liabilities primarily due to favorable claims experience. Results by Geographic Area Net revenue by geographic area for the years ended September 26, 2008, September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006 was as follows ($ in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Net revenue(1): United States $ 9,661 $ 8,884 $ 8,617 Other Americas 1,537 1,445 1,354 Europe, Middle East and Africa 5,749 5,338 4,707 Asia Pacific 3,252 2,810 2,388 $ 20,199 $ 18,477 $ 17,066 (1)Revenue is attributed to individual countries based on the reporting entity that records the transaction. Segment Results The segment discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in results for each of our segments included in continuing operations. ADT Worldwide Net revenue, operating income and operating margin for ADT Worldwide for the years ended September 26, 2008, September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006 were as follows ($ in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Revenue from product sales $ 2,821 $ 2,734 $ 2,546 Service revenue 5,196 4,914 4,659 Net revenue $ 8,017 $ 7,648 $ 7,205 Operating income $ 910 $ 842 $ 907 Operating margin 11.4 % 11.0 % 12.6 % 44 Net revenue by geographic area for ADT Worldwide for the years ended September 26, 2008, September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006 was as follows ($ in millions): 2008 2007 2006 North America $ 4,218 $ 4,094 $ 3,985 Europe, Middle East and Africa 2,641 2,574 2,344 Rest of World 1,158 980 876 $ 8,017 $ 7,648 $ 7,205 Net revenue for ADT Worldwide increased $369 million, or 4.8%, during 2008, with product revenue up 3.2% and service revenue up 5.7%, as compared to 2007. Revenue from product sales includes sales and installation of electronic security and other systems. Service revenue is comprised of electronic security services and maintenance, including the monitoring of burglar alarms, fire alarms and other life safety systems as well as services related to retailer anti theft systems. Approximately 50% of ADTs total net revenue is contractual and is considered recurring revenue. Overall, recurring revenue grew 6.1% during 2008 while systems installation and service revenue grew 3.7%. Geographically, North America grew 3%, resulting largely from growth in recurring revenue which was partially offset by weakness in the retailer end market. The North America net revenue increase also includes the impact of acquisitions, which contributed $53 million. Although we experienced year over year net revenue increase in North America, this was partially offset by the retailer end market which continued to show signs of weakness during the fourth quarter of 2008. We will continue to monitor these market conditions as well as the current economic environment as we enter fiscal year 2009. Revenue in the EMEA region increased $67 million, or 2.6%, as a result of foreign currency exchange rates which had a favorable impact of $151 million. This increase was partially offset by a decline in systems installation and service revenue due to weakness in the retailer end market as well as commercial softness primarily in the United Kingdom. The 18.2% revenue growth in the Rest of World geographies was primarily driven by growth in both recurring revenue and contracting across all regions. The Rest of the World increase included the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $30 million. Overall, the ADT Worldwide net revenue increase included the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $213 million. The net impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and other activity positively affected revenue by $27 million. Operating margin in ADT Worldwide increased to 11.4% in 2008 from 11.0% in 2007. North America is one of the most profitable geographic areas for ADT Worldwide with 2008 and 2007 operating margin of 15.8% and 16.9%, respectively. Margins in North America were negatively impacted by $58 million of restructuring and asset impairments in 2008 compared to $8 million in 2007. Restructuring charges in 2008 include $58 million relating to the reacquisition of certain franchise rights that were deemed to be unfavorable to the Company. There were no charges related to the reacquisition of franchise rights in 2007. In addition, North America incurred $48 million and $12 million to convert customers from analog to digital signal transmissions in 2008 and 2007, respectively. North America operating margins benefited from continued growth in recurring revenue partially offset by declines in the retailer end market. ADT EMEA had 2008 and 2007 operating margin of 4.6% and 3.1%, respectively. EMEAs operating income included $52 million of restructuring and impairments in 2008 compared with $71 million in 2007. EMEA margins benefited from reduced costs as a result of the restructuring program, which was partially offset by volume decreases as discussed above. Attrition rates for customers in our ADT Worldwide business increased over the prior year to an average of 12.9% on a trailing 12 month basis for 2008, as compared to 12.3% for 2007 and 14.2% in 2006. The increased attrition was partially due to the analog to digital conversion project and partially due to the market conditions in the commercial business, which included customers switching from a 45 contractual service agreement to a time and material basis. Internationally, our attrition rate continued to improve. Operating income in 2008 increased $68 million, or 8.1%, as compared to 2007. Factors that positively impacted operating income included increased volume, particularly our higher margin recurring revenue, operational efficiencies, including those achieved from restructuring activities in Europe, lower depreciation and amortization expense and lower long lived asset impairment charges. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense occurred primarily in North America and resulted from changes to the depreciation method and estimated useful lives for pooled subscriber assets and changes to the estimated useful lives of dealer intangible assets. The reduction in depreciation and amortization expense was partially offset by increased net expenses of $51 million, which primarily related to converting customers from analog to digital signal transmissions in North America. Results for 2007 include goodwill impairment charges due to the reorganization of our management and segment reporting structure following the Separation. Net revenue for ADT Worldwide increased 6.1% during 2007, with product revenue up 7.4% and service revenue up 5.5%, as compared to 2006. The 2.7% revenue growth in North America resulted largely from an increase in commercial installations, primarily in the retailer market, as well as an increase in the recurring revenue base. Revenue in the EMEA region grew 9.8%, primarily driven by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The 11.9% revenue growth in the Rest of World geographies was primarily driven by strong growth in Asia and Latin America and, to a lesser extent, favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Overall, net revenue was favorably affected by $213 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates while the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures unfavorably impacted net revenue by $3 million. Operating income of $842 million in 2007 decreased $65 million from $907 million in 2006. Factors that positively impacted operating income included increased volume, operational efficiencies and reductions to depreciation and amortization expense, of $26 million. The decrease to depreciation and amortization expense resulted from changes to the depreciation method and estimated useful lives for pooled subscriber assets and changes to the estimated useful lives of dealer intangible assets. These increases were more than offset by a goodwill impairment charge of $46 million, due to the reorganization of our management and segment reporting structure, as well as increased investment in selling and marketing in Americas and Asia. In addition, results for 2007 included restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net of $83 million, which were primarily related to actions to improve field efficiencies and consolidating certain administrative functions in Europe, and an impairment of certain indefinite lived intangible assets. Restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net were $5 million in 2006. Flow Control Net revenue, operating income and operating margin for Flow Control for the years ended September 26, 2008, September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006 were as follows ($ in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Revenue from product sales $ 4,201 $ 3,618 $ 3,002 Service revenue 217 148 133 Net revenue $ 4,418 $ 3,766 $ 3,135 Operating income $ 618 $ 457 $ 356 Operating margin 14.0 % 12.1 % 11.4 % Net revenue for Flow Control increased $652 million, or 17.3%, in 2008 as compared to 2007. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by volume growth from continued strength in the valves and 46 thermal businesses, and to a lesser extent, the water business. The increase in the valves business was primarily driven by continued project growth in the oil and gas industry while the thermal business benefited primarily from continued strong project growth coupled with increased selling prices. While revenue within the water business increased year over year, project activity declined during the second half of 2008, primarily in Australia. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted revenue by $314 million. The net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other activity positively affected revenue by $6 million. Operating income increased $161 million, or 35.2%, in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily from revenue growth, as well as volume efficiencies. Flow Control incurred restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net of $8 million, compared to $28 million in 2007. Additionally, selling, general and administrative expenses in 2008 included an environmental remediation charge of $6 million related to the closure of a facility in North America as compared to no charges in 2007. Net revenue for Flow Control increased $631 million, or 20.1%, in 2007 as compared to 2006. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by volume growth from continued strength in most industrial end markets with significant project growth in the energy and water sectors. Growth in these sectors was strong across all geographical regions, and, in particular, Asia Pacific and Europe. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted revenue by $197 million while the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures unfavorably impacted net revenue by $16 million. The increase in operating income of $101 million, or 28.4%, in 2007 as compared 2006 was primarily due to revenue growth, as well as improved utilization rates. The increase in operating income during 2007 was partially offset by restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net of $28 million, which includes $6 million in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses. Fire Protection Services Net revenue, operating income and operating margin for Fire Protection Services for the years ended September 26, 2008, September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006 were as follows ($ in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Revenue from product sales $ 1,860 $ 1,790 $ 1,629 Service revenue 1,693 1,576 1,521 Net revenue $ 3,553 $ 3,366 $ 3,150 Operating income $ 321 $ 258 $ 241 Operating margin 9.0 % 7.7 % 7.7 % Net revenue for Fire Protection Services increased $187 million, or 5.6%, during 2008 as compared to 2007, driven by increases in both product sales and service revenues. Revenue from product sales includes sales and installation of fire protection and other systems. Service revenue comprises of inspection, maintenance, service and monitoring of fire detection and suppression systems. This increase in product sales was aided by foreign currency exchange rates, which had a favorable impact of $63 million. The increase in service revenue related to growth in service work and sprinkler contracting in North America and Asia primarily as a result of an increase in demand from the education and healthcare industries in North America and continued commercial expansion in the Asia Pacific region. Additionally, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact of $62 million on service revenue. The increase was partially offset by reduced revenue in EMEA and Australia/New Zealand primarily due to a decline in contracting revenue as a result of a strategic initiative to be more selective in our pursuit of contracts. Additionally, the net revenue increase was partially offset due to the planned exit of low performing non core activities in Latin America and Asia. Overall, the Fire 47 Protection Services net revenue increase included the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $125 million. Operating income increased $63 million, or 24.4%, during 2008 as compared to 2007 resulting largely from increased volume and improved margins, primarily in North America, and to a lesser extent, Asia and EMEA. The increase in operating income during 2008 was partially offset by $22 million of restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges. Also, operating income was unfavorably impacted by $9 million due to a goodwill impairment in the Latin America reporting unit. Net revenue for Fire Protection Services increased $216 million, or 6.9%, during 2007 as compared to 2006, driven largely by a 9.9% increase in revenue from product sales. This increase was largely the result of strong growth in most regions which benefited from continuing strength in commercial construction activity in our focused end markets. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact of $101 million while divestitures had a negative impact of $30 million. Operating income increased $17 million during 2007 as compared to 2006 resulting largely from increased volume, and improved margins, primarily in North America. Results for 2007 included restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net of $23 million, of which $1 million is included in cost of sales, primarily related to actions to improve field efficiencies and consolidate certain administrative functions in Europe. Operating income was unfavorably impacted by $1 million of divestiture charges, compared to no charges in 2006. Electrical and Metal Products Net revenue, operating income and operating margin for Electrical and Metal Products for the years ended September 26, 2008, September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006 were as follows ($ in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Revenue from product sales $ 2,266 $ 1,970 $ 1,946 Service revenue 6 4 3 Net revenue $ 2,272 $ 1,974 $ 1,949 Operating income $ 342 $ 159 $ 319 Operating margin 15.1 % 8.1 % 16.4 % Net revenue for Electrical and Metal Products increased $298 million, or 15.1%, in 2008 as compared to 2007. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by selling price increases for steel tubular products and to a lesser extent armored cable products partially offset by decreased sales volume for both products. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact of $44 million. Operating income increased $183 million, or 115.1%, in 2008 as compared to 2007. The increase in operating income was primarily due to favorable spreads on both steel tubular and armored cable products. As inventory is replenished at higher prices, the spreads will narrow, which will result in lower operating income. Income generated by higher selling prices for both steel tubular and armored cable products were partially offset by decreased sales volume for both products. Operational excellence initiatives resulted in reductions in production cost rates for both steel tubular and armored cable products. The increase in operating income during 2008 was partially offset by $43 million of restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, as compared to $7 million in 2007. Net revenue for Electrical and Metal Products increased $25 million, or 1.3%, in 2007 as compared to 2006. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $20 million contributed to the increase in revenue. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by increased sales volume of 48 armored cable products, steel tubular products, and higher selling prices and sales volumes in Brazil. These increases were largely offset by the impact of lower selling prices on steel tubular products in North America. The decrease in operating income of $160 million, or 50.2%, in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to unfavorable spreads on both steel tubular and armored cable products. Income generated by higher sales volume for both armored cable and steel tubular products were more than offset by lower selling prices and higher raw material prices. Results for 2007 included restructuring, asset impairment, and divestiture charges, net of $7 million, compared to no charges in 2006. Safety Products Net revenue, operating income and operating margin for Safety Products for the years ended September 26, 2008, September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006 were as follows ($ in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Revenue from product sales $ 1,916 $ 1,704 $ 1,608 Service revenue 18 15 16 Net revenue $ 1,934 $ 1,719 $ 1,624 Operating income $ 284 $ 274 $ 196 Operating margin 14.7 % 15.9 % 12.1 % Net revenue for Safety Products increased $215 million, or 12.5%, during 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily from strong performance in the fire suppression, and to a lesser extent electronic security and life safety businesses. The increase in the fire suppression business was driven by continued growth in the energy and marine sectors, favorable product mix and increased selling prices to offset increasing raw material costs. The increase in the life safety business was primarily driven by growth in North America as a result of increased spending by fire departments due to the release of federal funds, and from increased selling prices. The increase in the electronic security business was partially due to higher volume and new product introductions primarily related to casinos and schools. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $76 million also contributed to the increase in revenue. Operating income increased $10 million, or 3.6% in 2008 as compared to 2007. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to increased sales volume along with the impact of cost savings from operational excellence initiatives. The increase in operating income during 2008 was partially offset by $73 million of restructuring, asset impairment, and divestiture charges, net as compared to $29 million in 2007. Net revenue for Safety Products increased $95 million, or 5.8%, during 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily from strong performance in the fire suppression and electronic security businesses. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $49 million also contributed to the increase in revenue. The increase in the fire suppression business was driven by continued growth in the energy and marine sectors in the Americas and the Middle East as well as increased selling prices to help offset the significant cost increase of raw materials. The electronic security business also experienced favorable growth as a result of new product introductions and new market expansions. These increases were partially offset by continued softness in the life safety business in North America due to delays of federal assistance provided to fire departments. Operating income increased $78 million to $274 million for the year ended September 28, 2007 compared to the prior year. Prior year results included a $100 million charge related to a pre existing Voluntary Replacement Program ("VRP") for sprinkler heads in the fire suppression business. The deadline for filing claims to participate in the VRP ended on August 31, 2007. In light of the most current claims data, an additional $10 million charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007. Also, 49 2007 results include the effect of restructuring, asset impairment, and divestiture charges, net of $29 million. Corporate and Other Corporate expense for 2008 was $3.2 billion lower as compared to the prior year, primarily resulting from various charges in 2007, including the class action settlement charge of $2.862 billion, separation costs of $117 million and net restructuring and asset impairment charges of $40 million primarily related to the consolidation of certain headquarter functions. Corporate expense for 2008 included net charges of $28 million composed of a $29 million charge for a legacy legal settlement, $4 million of separation costs and $5 million for restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net, offset by a credit of $10 million for class action settlement recoveries. The remaining decrease in corporate expense is primarily related to cost reduction initiatives and the restructuring program. Corporate expense for 2006 included $72 million of income related to the extinguishment of certain payment obligations under a split dollar life insurance policy and rabbi trust pursuant to a settlement with Mr. Kozlowski, former Chief Executive Officer, and $48 million of income resulting from a reduction in our estimated workers compensation liabilities primarily due to favorable claims experience. These income items were partially offset by incremental stock option charges of $47 million required under SFAS No. 123R, Separation related costs of $49 million and restructuring and divestiture charges of $2 million. Interest Income and Expense Interest income was $110 million in 2008, as compared to $104 million and $46 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increases in interest income in 2008 and 2007 are primarily related to interest earned on the class action settlement escrow of $47 and $41 million, respectively. Interest expense was $396 million in 2008, as compared to $313 million in 2007 and $279 million in 2006. The increases in interest expense in 2008 and 2007 are a result of interest on the class action settlement liability of $47 and $41 million, respectively, and increased costs related to our bridge loan and revolving credit facilities. The weighted average interest rate on total debt outstanding at September 26, 2008, September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006 were 6.2%, 6.3% and 6.0%, respectively. In 2007 and 2006, net interest amounts were proportionally allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics based on the debt amounts that we believe were utilized by Covidien and Tyco Electronics historically inclusive of amounts directly incurred, and is included in discontinued operations. Allocated net interest was calculated using our historical weighted average interest rate on debt, including the impact of interest rate swap agreements. The portion of Tycos interest income allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics was $35 million and $53 million during 2007 and 2006, respectively. The portion of Tycos interest expense allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics was $242 million and $378 million during 2007 and 2006, respectively. 50  Other Expense, Net Other expense, net was $224 million in 2008 and $255 million in 2007. Other expense, net in 2008 primarily relates to the loss of $258 million on extinguishment of debt related to the consent solicitation and exchange offers and termination of the bridge loan facility offset by income of $6 million recorded in connection with the settlement of its 3.125% convertible senior debentures and related financial instruments. See Notes 13 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company also recorded other than temporary impairments and realized losses on the sale of investments of $6 million related primarily to investments in corporate debt. Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, the Company recorded $40 million of income as a result of an increase in the receivables due from Covidien and Tyco Electronics under the Tax Sharing Agreement upon the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation ("FIN") No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertain Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109." The Company also recorded $6 million of expense for other activity in accordance with the Tax Sharing Agreements during 2008. During 2007, other expense, net consisted primarily of a $259 million loss on early extinguishment of debt incurred in connection with debt tender offers undertaken in connection with the Separation, for which no tax benefit is available. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This charge consists primarily of premiums paid and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts. The total loss on early extinguishment of debt was $647 million, with $259 million included in continuing operations and $388 million allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics and included in discontinued operations. Income Taxes Effective Income Tax Rate Our effective income tax rate was 23.4% for 2008. Income taxes during 2008 were positively impacted by increased profitability in lower tax rate jurisdictions and release of deferred tax valuation allowances partially offset by enacted tax law changes that negatively impacted the non U.S. deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate for 2007 is not meaningful primarily as a result of the class action settlement charge, net of $2.862 billion and the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $259 million for which no tax benefit is available. Additionally, taxes for 2007 were negatively impacted by tax costs related to the Separation of $92 million and were favorably impacted by the release of a deferred tax valuation allowance related to non U.S. tax rulings received during the period and reduced reserve requirements on certain legacy tax matters. Our effective income tax rate for 2006 was 27.1%. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $745 million and $644 million at September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," which requires a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is "more likely than not" that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the 51 tax liabilities. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by these taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as payment is not expected within one year. Tax Sharing Agreement In connection with the spin offs of Covidien and Tyco Electronics from Tyco, Tyco entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that generally governs Covidiens, Tyco Electronics and Tycos respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations after the Separation with respect to taxes, including ordinary course of business taxes and taxes, if any, incurred as a result of any failure of the distribution of all of the shares of Covidien or Tyco Electronics to qualify as a tax free distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 355 of the Code or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin offs to qualify for tax favored treatment under the Code. Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, the Company shares responsibility for certain of Tycos, Covidiens and Tyco Electronics income tax liabilities based on a sharing formula for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. More specifically, Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics share 27%, 42% and 31%, respectively, of shared income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to Tycos, Covidiens and Tyco Electronics U.S. income tax returns. All costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are shared equally among the parties. Tyco has recorded a receivable from Covidien and Tyco Electronics of $113 million at September 26, 2008 and $103 million at September 28, 2007 which is included in other assets as our estimate of their portion of the Tax Sharing obligations. Other liabilities include $554 million and $543 million at September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007, respectively for the fair value of Tycos obligations under the Tax Sharing Agreement, determined in accordance with FIN No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." Tyco assesses the shared tax liabilities and related FIN No. 45 liability at each reporting period. The receivable and liability were initially recognized with an offset to shareholders equity in 2007. In the first quarter of 2008, in connection with the adoption of FIN No. 48 and the related increase in uncertain tax positions for shared tax liabilities under the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco increased its receivable from Covidien and Tyco Electronics under the Tax Sharing Agreement with a corresponding increase to other income, net by $40 million ($0.08 for both basic and diluted earnings per share). In addition, $6 million of expense for other activity was recorded in accordance with the Tax Sharing Agreement during 2008. Tyco will provide payment under the Tax Sharing Agreement as the shared income tax liabilities are settled. Settlement is expected to occur as the audit process by local taxing authorities is completed for the impacted years. Given the nature of the shared liabilities, the maximum amount of potential future payments is not determinable. In the event the Separation is determined to be taxable and such determination was the result of actions taken after the Separation by Tyco, Covidien or Tyco Electronics, the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on Tyco, Covidien or Tyco Electronics as a result thereof. If such determination is not the result of actions taken after the Separation by Tyco, Covidien or Tyco Electronics, then Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics would be responsible for 27%, 42% and 31%, respectively, of any taxes imposed on Tyco, Covidien or Tyco Electronics as a result of such determination. Such tax amounts could be significant. The Company is responsible for all of its own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreements sharing formula. In addition, Covidien and Tyco Electronics are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the Tax Sharing Agreements sharing formula. 52 If any party to the Tax Sharing Agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no partys fault, each non defaulting party would be required to pay, equally with any other non defaulting party, the amounts in default. In addition, if another party to the Tax Sharing Agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority, the Company could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, the Company may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of its agreed upon share of Tycos, Covidiens and Tyco Electronics tax liabilities. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of guarantees and indemnifications extended between Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics. Other Income Tax Matters The Company and its subsidiaries income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. The Company is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Management has assessed the issues related to these adjustments for recognition and measurement under FIN No. 48 and has recorded unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with FIN No. 48. The ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain and could result in a material impact to the Companys financial position, results of operations, cash flows or the effective tax rate in future reporting periods. In 2004, in connection with the IRS audit of the 1997 through 2000 years, the Company submitted to the IRS proposed adjustments to these prior period U.S. federal income tax returns resulting in a reduction in the taxable income previously filed. During 2006, the IRS accepted substantially all of the proposed adjustments, and the Company developed proposed amendments to U.S. federal income tax returns for additional periods through 2002. On the basis of previously accepted amendments, the Company has determined that these adjustments will more likely than not be accepted and, accordingly, has recorded them in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such adjustments did not have a material impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, during 2008 the Company completed proposed amendments to its U.S. federal income tax returns for periods subsequent to 2002, which primarily reflect the roll forward through 2006 of the amendments for the periods 1997 to 2002. Such adjustments did not have a material impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. While the final adjustments cannot be determined until the income tax return amendment process and the IRS review is completed, the Company believes that any resulting adjustments will not have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. During the third quarter of 2007, the IRS concluded its field examination of certain of Tycos U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 though 2000 and issued anticipated Revenue Agents Reports ("RARs") which reflect the IRS determination of proposed tax adjustments for the periods under audit. The RARs propose tax audit adjustments to certain of the Companys previously filed tax return positions. The Company agreed with the IRS on adjustments totaling $498 million, with an estimated cash impact to the Company of $458 million, and during the third quarter of 2007, the Company paid $458 million, of which $163 million related to the Companys discontinued operations. The Company appealed other proposed tax audit adjustments totaling approximately $1 billion relating to Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics, and, as Audit Managing Party as specified in the Tax Sharing Agreement, the Company intends to vigorously defend its prior filed tax return positions. During the second quarter of 2008, the IRS issued additional RARs asserting a withholding tax liability of approximately $106 million associated with the prior proposed tax adjustments related to Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics for the 1997 to 2000 period. The withholding tax amount asserted against Tyco is immaterial. During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company reached an agreement 53 with the IRS appeals team to work towards timely resolution of all unagreed issues related to this time period. The Company, as Audit Managing Party as specified in the Tax Sharing Agreement, intends to vigorously defend its prior filed tax return positions and determined that no adjustment is required to the Companys guarantees and indemnifications liability recorded in conjunction with the Tax Sharing Agreement as discussed in "Guarantees" within Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Additionally, the IRS is auditing the prior tax returns of the Company, which include legal entities of Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics for the 2001 to 2004 period. The IRS has not issued any RARs for this period. The IRS proposed civil fraud penalties against a prior subsidiary that was distributed to Tyco Electronics arising from alleged actions of former executives in connection with intercompany transfers of stock of Simplex Technologies in 1998 and 1999. Based on statutory guidelines, we estimate the proposed penalties could range between $30 million and $50 million. The Company, as Audit Managing Party as specified in the Tax Sharing Agreement, intends to vigorously oppose the assertion of any such penalties against Tyco Electronics, in part, because beginning in 2003 the Company discovered, investigated and reported the conduct at issue to the IRS and fully cooperated in the criminal prosecution of the Companys former Chief Tax Officer on a charge of willful filing of a false tax return. This is a pre Separation shared tax matter under the Tax Sharing Agreement. Except for earnings that are currently distributed, no additional material provision has been made for U.S. or non U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or the Company has concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of distribution of such earnings. A liability could arise if amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries. Divestitures Held for Sale and Reflected as Continuing Operations During the third quarter of 2008, the Company approved a plan to sell a business in the Safety Products segment. This business is presented in continuing operations as the criteria for discontinued operations has not been met. The Company has assessed and determined that the carrying value of this business is recoverable and will continue to assess recoverability based on current fair value, less cost to sell, until the business is sold. Fair value used for the impairment assessment was based on existing market conditions. The Company expects to complete a sale during the first half of fiscal 2009. Discontinued Operations The Company continued to assess the strategic fit of its various businesses and has pursued divestiture of certain businesses which do not align with its long term strategy. During 2008, as part of the Companys portfolio refinement efforts, the Company sold its ETEO business, Ancon business, NDC business, and a European manufacturer of public address products and acoustic systems. Additionally, the Company substantially completed the sale of its Infrastructure Services Business, during the fourth quarter of 2008. These businesses met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and have been included in discontinued operations in all periods presented. In May 2008, the Company sold 100% of the stock of ETEO, a Brazilian subsidiary of Infrastructure Services for $338 million of net cash proceeds and recorded a pre tax gain of $232 million, including the effects of the economic hedge of the purchase price discussed below. The gain was recorded in Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the Companys 54 Consolidated Statement of Operations. ETEO was part of the Companys Corporate and Other segment. During September 2007, Tyco entered into an economic hedge of the Brazilian Real denominated contractual sale price of the ETEO business. Since the hedging transaction was directly linked to the proceeds from the sale of a business that was reflected in discontinued operations, Tyco began including the impact of the hedge in discontinued operations during the first quarter of 2008. During the third quarter of 2008, Tyco incurred a pre tax loss of $36 million on this hedge. The impact of the hedge in the prior year was not material. In February 2008, the Company executed a definitive agreement to sell the remaining portion of Infrastructure Services excluding Earth Tech Brasil Ltda. ("ET Brasil") to AECOM Technologies Corporation ("AECOM"). In July 2008, the Company substantially completed the sale to AECOM. The sale was completed for $455 million net of a $20 million working capital adjustment resulting in net cash proceeds of $435 million. The $435 million of net cash proceeds includes $53 million for the sale of Earth Tech UK. A pre tax gain of approximately $183 million was recorded in income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations. In order to complete the sale, the Company is required to obtain consents and approvals to transfer the legal ownership of the Earth Tech UK businesses to AECOM. Therefore, in July 2008 the Company and AECOM entered into an agreement in which AECOM would manage the UK businesses on behalf of the Company, while the Company would finance the UK businesses operations. Also as part of the agreement, AECOM agreed to reimburse the Company for all of the funding provided by the Company through the closing date of the sale. As a result of the agreement, AECOM assumed all the risks and rewards of ownership for the UK businesses. At September 26, 2008, the necessary consents and approvals had not been obtained by the Company to transfer the legal ownership of the Earth Tech UK businesses to AECOM. The Company expects to record a gain related to the UK businesses upon receipt of the necessary consents and approvals, which is expected to occur in the first half of 2009. Certain assets in China were excluded from the sale and are expected to be transferred during the first half of 2009 for additional consideration of approximately $55 million once the necessary consents and approvals are obtained. Infrastructure Services, ET Brasil, the EarthTech UK business and the China assets discussed above were part of the Companys Corporate and Other segment. As ET Brasil was excluded from the sale to AECOM, as discussed above, the Company recorded a pre tax impairment charge of approximately $16 million to write down ET Brasil to its fair value, less cost to sell during 2008. Fair value used for the impairment assessment was based on existing market conditions. In July 2008, the Company executed a definitive agreement to sell ET Brasil for approximately $16 million in net cash proceeds. The sale is expected to close in the first quarter of 2009 upon receipt of the necessary consents and approvals. At September 26, 2008, the Company has assessed and determined that the carrying value of the remaining assets in China and ET Brasil are recoverable based on current fair value, less cost to sell. The Company will continue to assess recoverability until the assets in the China and ET Brasil are sold. During 2008, the Company settled a contract dispute arising under its former Infrastructure Services business. In connection with the settlement, the Company assessed its assets under the original contract and concluded the assets were no longer recoverable, resulting in a $51 million charge to discontinued operations. In April 2008, the Company sold Ancon, a manufacturer of stainless steel products used in masonry construction. Ancon was part of the Companys Corporate and Other segment. The sale was completed for $164 million in net cash proceeds and a pre tax gain of $100 million was recorded which was largely exempt from tax. The gain was recorded in income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company received an additional $6 million of proceeds related to the sale of Ancon. 55 In February 2008, the Company sold NDC, a company in the Japanese fire protection industry. NDC was part of the Companys Fire Protection and Safety Products Segments. The sale was completed for $50 million in net cash proceeds and a pre tax gain of $7 million was recorded. The gain was recorded in income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations. In January 2008, the Company sold a European manufacturer of public address products and acoustic systems which was part of the Companys Fire Protection Segment and recorded an $8 million pre tax loss on sale. The loss was recorded in income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations. During the first quarter of 2007, Aquas Industriales de Jose, C.A. ("AIJ"), a joint venture that was majority owned by Infrastructure Services, was sold for $42 million in net cash proceeds and a pre tax gain of $19 million was recorded. The gain was recorded in discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations. AIJ was part of the Companys Corporate and Other segment. During the third quarter of 2007, Tyco completed the Separation and has presented its Healthcare and Electronics businesses as discontinued operations in all periods presented. In each period prior to the Separation, net interest and loss on early extinguishment of debt, which is included in other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, amounts were proportionally allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics based on the debt amounts that Tyco believes were utilized by Covidien and Tyco Electronics historically inclusive of amounts directly incurred. Allocated net interest was calculated using our historical weighted average interest rate on debt including the impact of interest rate swap agreements. These allocated amounts were included in discontinued operations. During 2007, allocated interest income, interest expense and other expense, net was $35 million, $242 million and $388 million, respectively. During 2006, allocated interest income, interest expense and other expense, net was $53 million, $378 million and $0 million, respectively. During 2007, the Company incurred pre tax separation costs related primarily to professional services and employee related costs of $154 million and $289 million, respectively, in discontinued operations. Additionally, the year ended September 28, 2007 includes tax charges related to the Separation primarily for the write off of deferred tax assets that are no longer realizable of $88 million in discontinued operations. The Company has used available information to develop its best estimates for certain assets and liabilities related to the Separation. In limited instances, final determination of the balances will be made in subsequent periods. During the year ended September 28, 2007, $72 million was recorded through shareholders equity, primarily related to a cash true up adjustment of $57 million and $15 million of other items. During the year ended September 26, 2008, $70 million of other items was recorded through shareholders equity. The other items, which aggregate $85 million, reflect immaterial adjustments to shareholders equity which were recorded to correct the distribution amount at the date of Separation. Adjustments in the future for the impact of filing final income tax returns in certain jurisdictions where those returns include a combination of Tyco, Covidien and or Tyco Electronics legal entities and for certain amended income tax returns for the periods prior to the Separation may be recorded to either shareholders equity or the statement of income depending on the specific item giving rise to the adjustment. 56 Net revenue, income from operations, gain (loss) on sale, separation costs and income tax expense for discontinued operations for 2008, 2007 and 2006 are as follows ($ in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Net revenue $ 1,221 $ 19,271 $ 25,067 Pre tax income from discontinued operations $ 51 $ 2,816 $ 3,842 Pre tax gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations 484 (549 ) (245 ) Separation costs (719 ) (120 ) Income tax expense (77 ) (766 ) (690 ) Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes $ 458 $ 782 $ 2,787 Balance sheet information for pending divestitures at September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007 is as follows ($ in millions): 2008 2007 Accounts receivable, net $ 52 $ 438 Inventories 24 64 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 18 47 Property, plant and equipment, net 20 166 Goodwill and other intangibles, net 157 236 Other assets 113 434 Total assets $ 384 $ 1,385 Current maturities of long term debt $ 4 $ 5 Accounts payable 27 228 Accrued and other current liabilities 58 320 Long term debt 18 Other liabilities 39 91 Total liabilities $ 128 $ 662 Minority interest $ 1 $ 30 Losses on divestitures During 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded $1 million, $4 million and $2 million, respectively, of divestiture charges in continuing operations in connection with the write down to fair value, less cost to sell, of certain businesses, which did not get classified as discontinued operations as they did not meet the criteria for such classification. The fair value used for the impairment assessments was primarily based on the terms and conditions included or expected to be included in the sales agreements. Acquisitions As part of the Companys strategy to strengthen its product and service offerings and market positions, the Company acquired Winner Security Services LLC ("Winner"), Sensormatic Security Corp. ("SSC") and FirstService Security ("FirstService") during 2008. On June 5, 2008, the Companys ADT Worldwide segment acquired substantially all of the assets of Winner for $90 million. The franchise was originally granted by Sensormatic Electronics Corporation and granted Winner rights to sell, install and service certain Sensormatic products and entitled Winner to commissions on Sensormatic products sold, installed or shipped into its franchise territories. Sensormatic products are sold through ADT Worldwide and Safety Products. 57 On July 9, 2008, the Companys ADT Worldwide segment acquired substantially all of the assets of SSC, including franchise rights, and agreed to settle a related legal matter for total consideration of approximately $86 million. SSC was a franchisee of Sensormatic Electronics Corporation in the states of Virginia and Maryland and in the District of Columbia. It was the last remaining major Sensormatic franchise. Under the original franchise agreement, SSC was granted rights to sell, install and service certain Sensormatic products and was entitled to commissions on Sensormatic products sold, installed or shipped into its franchise territories. Sensormatic and SSC also settled the previously disclosed litigation between the parties related to the SSC franchise for $6 million in connection with the transaction. The value ascribed to the settlement of the legal matter was determined based on the consideration paid in excess of the fair value of the franchise and franchise rights acquired. These transactions were accounted for as business combinations and the Company applied EITF Issue No. 04 1, "Accounting for Preexisting Relationships between the Parties to a Business Combination," since there were preexisting relationships between the Company and Winner and SSC that needed to be assessed and accounted for separately. After assessing the specific facts and circumstances related to these transactions, the Company recorded charges of $38 million and $20 million for Winner and SSC, respectively during 2008 for the reacquisition of franchise rights that were deemed to be unfavorable to the Company when compared to pricing for current market transactions for similar arrangements. The Company utilized an income method valuation approach in measuring the value of the preexisting relationship. Since these charges relate to a change in the manner in which the Company will conduct business in these territories, they have been reflected as restructuring charges. The remaining purchase price for Winner was $52 million, which consists of a $46 million indefinite lived intangible asset, $1 million of customer lists which are amortizable over a 10 year period and $5 million of goodwill. The remaining purchase price for SSC was $60 million, which consists of a $52 million indefinite lived intangible asset, $4 million of customer lists which are amortizable over a 10 year period and $4 million of goodwill. Goodwill associated with the Winner and SSC transactions is deductible for tax purposes. On June 30, 2008, the Companys ADT Worldwide segment acquired FirstService Security, a division of FirstService Corporation, for approximately $187 million. FirstService Security is a commercial security systems integrator and provides a full range of integrated security system services, including design, engineering, installation, servicing and monitoring of access control, closed circuit television and intrusion systems. The purchase price for FirstService has been allocated on a preliminary basis and consists of $38 million of net working capital and other assets, $5 million of property, plant and equipment, net, $52 million of intangible assets and $92 million of goodwill. Goodwill associated with the FirstService transaction is not deductible for tax purposes. Additionally during 2008, cash paid for other acquisitions included in continuing operations, primarily within ADT Worldwide and Safety Products, totaled $38 million. During 2007, cash paid for acquisitions included in continuing operations, primarily within ADT Worldwide, Safety Products and Flow Control, totaled $31 million. Cash paid for acquisitions by businesses included in continuing operations during 2006 was $5 million. These acquisitions were funded utilizing cash from operations. The results of operations of the acquired companies have been included in Tycos consolidated results from the respective acquisition dates. These acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The aggregate amounts paid for the acquired businesses have been allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on preliminary estimates of fair value at September 26, 2008. The purchase price allocation remains subject to change based on final valuations of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company does not expect the finalization of these matters to have a material 58 effect on these allocations. The following represents preliminary purchase price allocations for the acquired businesses ($ in million): Net working capital and other assets $ 21 Property, plant and equipment, net 7 Goodwill 140 Intangible assets, net 170 Purchase price $ 338 Payments relating to the reacquisition of unfavorable franchise rights and legal settlement 64 Aggregate amount paid $ 402 Acquisition Liabilities At September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007, acquisition liabilities were included in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows ($ in millions): 2008 2007 Accrued and other current liabilities $ 3 $ 4 Other liabilities 9 10 $ 12 $ 14 Acquisition liabilities relate to facility exit costs, employee severance and benefits, distributor and supplier cancellation fees and other costs. The Company paid $2 million, $5 million and $5 million to fund acquisition liabilities during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Holdback Liabilities The Company paid cash of approximately $5 million and $2 million during 2007 and 2006, respectively, relating to holdback liabilities related to certain prior period acquisitions. There were no such payments in 2008. Holdback liabilities represent a portion of the purchase price withheld from the seller pending finalization of the acquisition balance sheet and other contingencies. At September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007, holdback liabilities were included in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows ($ in millions): 2008 2007 Other liabilities $ 18 $ 16 ADT Dealer Program During 2008, 2007 and 2006, Tyco paid $376 million, $409 million and $373 million of cash, respectively, to acquire approximately 370,000, 415,000 and 401,000 customer contracts for electronic security services through the ADT dealer program. Goodwill Impairment Annually and more frequently if triggering events occur, the Company tests goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. Fair value for the goodwill impairment test is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the Companys future budgets discounted using the Companys weighted average cost of capital and market indicators of terminal year cash flows. Other valuation methods are used to corroborate the discounted 59 cash flow method. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered potentially impaired. During the annual goodwill impairment testing for the fiscal year ended September 26, 2008, the carrying amount of goodwill in the Latin America Fire Protection business, part of the Fire Protection Services segment, exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill. As a result, the Company recognized a goodwill impairment of $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Furthermore, the Company believes its goodwill balance at September 26, 2008 is recoverable. In connection with the Separation, during the third quarter of 2007 Tyco reorganized into a new management and segment reporting structure. As part of these organizational changes, the Company assessed new reporting units and conducted valuations to determine the assignment of goodwill to the new reporting units based on their estimated relative fair values. Following the relative fair value goodwill allocation, the Company then tested goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded its fair value, goodwill was considered potentially impaired. Where goodwill was potentially impaired, we compared the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill to the carrying amount of that goodwill. The carrying amount of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill in the Australia and New Zealand Security Services business, part of the ADT Worldwide segment. As a result, the Company recognized a goodwill impairment of $46 million in the third quarter of 2007. In determining fair value, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgments in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. However, fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in the factors described above. In light of current economic conditions, additional impairments to one or more of our reporting units could occur in future periods whether or not connected to the annual impairment analysis. The Company has certain reporting units which have limited excess of fair value over carrying value. The goodwill balance for reporting units with less than a ten percent excess of fair value over carrying value in the aggregate was approximately $2.4 billion at September 26, 2008. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change During 2006, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation ("FIN") No. 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143." FIN No. 47 clarifies the timing of liability recognition for legal obligations associated with an asset retirement when the timing and (or) method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity and clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. FIN No. 47 requires that conditional asset retirement obligations, along with the associated capitalized asset retirement costs, be initially reported at their fair values. Upon adoption, the Company recognized a liability of $32 million for asset retirement obligations and an increase of $10 million in the carrying amount of the related assets, of which $19 million and $5 million are reflected in liabilities and assets of discontinued operations, respectively. The initial recognition resulted in a cumulative effect of accounting change of $14 million after tax loss ($22 million pre tax), reflecting the accumulated depreciation and accretion that would have been recognized in prior periods had the provisions of FIN No. 47 been in effect at the time. 60   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. Depreciation and Amortization Methods for Security Monitoring Related Assets Tyco generally considers assets related to the acquisition of new customers in its electronic security business in three asset categories: internally generated residential subscriber systems, internally generated commercial subscriber systems (collectively referred to as subscriber system assets) and customer accounts acquired through the ADT dealer program (referred to as dealer intangibles). Subscriber system assets include installed property, plant and equipment for which Tyco retains ownership and deferred costs directly related to the customer acquisition and system installation. Subscriber system assets and any deferred revenue resulting from the customer acquisition are accounted for over the expected life of the subscriber. In certain geographical areas where the Company has a large number of customers that behave in a similar manner over time, the Company accounts for subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue using pools, with separate pools for the components of subscriber system assets and any related deferred revenue based on the month and year of acquisition. Effective as of the beginning of the third quarter of 2007, Tyco changed the depreciation method and estimated useful life used to account for pooled subscriber system assets (primarily in North America) and related deferred revenue from the straight line method with lives ranging from 10 to 14 years to an accelerated method with lives up to 15 years. The accelerated method utilizes declining balance rates based on geographical area ranging from 160% to 195% for residential subscriber pools and 145% to 265% for commercial subscriber pools and converts to a straight line methodology when the resulting depreciation charge is greater than that from the accelerated method. The Company will continue to use a straight line method with a 14 year life for non pooled subscriber system assets (primarily in Europe and Asia) and related deferred revenue, with remaining balances written off upon customer termination. The change in the method and estimated useful life used to account for pooled subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue resulted from our ongoing analysis of all pertinent factors, including actual customer attrition data specific to customer categories and geographical areas, demand, competition, and the estimated technological life of the installed systems. The pertinent factors have been influenced by managements ongoing customer retention programs, as well as tactical and strategic initiatives to improve service delivery, customer satisfaction, and the credit worthiness of the subscriber customer base. All pertinent factors, including actual customer attrition data specific to customer categories and geographical areas, demand, competition, and the estimated technological life of the installed systems, will continue to be reviewed by the Company at each balance sheet date to assess the continued appropriateness of methods and estimated useful lives. Effective as of the beginning of the third quarter of 2007, Tyco also changed the estimated useful life of dealer intangibles in geographical areas comprising approximately 90% of the net carrying value of dealer intangibles from 12 to 15 years. The Company continues to amortize dealer intangible assets on an accelerated basis. The change in the estimated useful life used to account for dealer intangibles resulted from our ongoing analysis of all pertinent factors, including actual customer attrition data, demand, competition, and the estimated technological life of the installed systems. The pertinent factors have been influenced by managements ongoing customer retention programs, as well as tactical and strategic initiatives to improve service delivery, customer satisfaction, and the credit worthiness of the subscriber customer base. 61 Attrition rates for customers in our ADT Worldwide business were 12.9%, 12.3% and 14.2% on a trailing 12 month basis for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Revenue Recognition Contract sales for the installation of fire protection systems, large security intruder systems and other construction related projects are recorded primarily under the percentage of completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related total cost of the project at completion. The risk of this methodology is its dependence upon estimates of costs at completion, which are subject to the uncertainties inherent in long term contracts. Revisions to cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits each period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they become determinable. If estimates are inaccurate, there is risk that our revenue and profits for the period may be overstated or understated. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other markets participants. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience and trend analysis. Loss Contingencies Accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings, self insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on judgment, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates. Additionally, the Company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. Income Taxes In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and international pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction. Any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. If a change in a valuation allowance occurs, which was established in connection with an acquisition, such adjustment may impact goodwill rather than the income tax provision. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and 62 other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If the tax liabilities relate to tax uncertainties existing at the date of the acquisition of a business, the adjustment of such tax liabilities will result in an adjustment to the goodwill recorded at the date of acquisition. Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually and more frequently if triggering events occur. In performing these assessments, management relies on various factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable transactions and other market data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment. Since judgment is involved in performing fair value measurements used in goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets impairment analyses, there is risk that the carrying values of our goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets may be overstated. We elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for all goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. When testing for goodwill impairment, the Company follows the guidance prescribed in SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." First, the Company compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. Fair value for the goodwill impairment test is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the Companys future budgets discounted using the Companys weighted average cost of capital and market indicators of terminal year cash flows. Other valuation methods are used to corroborate the discounted cash flow method. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered potentially impaired and further tests are performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. In the second step of the goodwill impairment test, the Company compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. The Company allocates the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill. Disruptions to our business such as end market conditions and protracted economic weakness, unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units, the divestiture of a significant component of a reporting unit and market capitalization declines may result in our having to perform a goodwill impairment first step valuation analysis for some or all of our reporting units prior to the required annual assessment. These types of events and the resulting analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future. In determining fair value, we rely on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgments in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. However, fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in the factors described above. In light of current economic conditions, additional impairments to one or more of our reporting units could occur in future periods whether or not connected to the 63 annual impairment analysis. We have certain reporting units which have limited excess of fair value over carrying value. The goodwill balance for reporting units with less than a ten percent excess of fair value over carrying value in the aggregate was approximately $2.4 billion at September 26, 2008. Goodwill impairments related to continuing operations were $9 million and $46 million during 2008 and 2007, respectively. There were no goodwill impairments related to continuing operations during 2006. We believe our goodwill balance at September 26, 2008 is recoverable. Indefinite lived intangible assets consisting primarily of trade names are tested for impairment using the relief from royalty method. The Company believes that its intangible assets balance at September 26, 2008 is recoverable. However, fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to change. In light of current economic conditions, impairments to intangible assets could occur in future periods. Long Lived Assets Assets held and used by the Company, including property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. Tyco performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if impairment exists. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, Tyco groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identified. If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Impairments to long lived assets to be disposed of are recorded based upon the fair value less cost to sell of the applicable assets. The calculation of the fair value of long lived assets is based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of long lived assets, there is a risk that the carrying value of our long lived assets may be overstated or understated. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations. Two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions. The discount rate represents the market rate for high quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our present value of pension obligations by approximately $76 million. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected long term rates of return on those types of plan assets, in determining the expected long term return on plan assets. A 50 basis point decrease in the expected long term return on plan assets would increase our pension expense by approximately $10 million. For fiscal 2009, we expect that recent reductions in the value of certain investments held by our pension plans will increase our pension expenses, which, although not currently expected, may result in a material impact on our obligation to fund these plans with cash.  Liquidity and Capital Resources Recent global market and economic conditions have been, and continue to be, disrupted and volatile having an adverse impact on financial markets in general. The volatility has reached unprecedented levels. As a result of concern about the stability of the markets and the strength of counterparties, many lenders and institutional investors have reduced and, in some cases, ceased to provide funding to borrowers resulting in severely diminished liquidity and credit availability. At this 64 time, the extent to which these conditions will persist is unclear. To date, the Companys cost and availability of funding has not been adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and we do not expect it to be materially impacted in the near future. We continue to have sufficient borrowing capacity for our foreseeable needs based on our current cash flow forecast. We currently have two syndicated multi year revolving credit facilities: a $1.25 billion facility maturing on April 25, 2012 and a $500 million facility maturing on June 24, 2011 with an aggregate commitment of $1.75 billion. On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. ("Lehman") filed a petition under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. Lehman is one of the lenders in our $1.25 billion revolving credit facility with a commitment of $60 million. Our $500 million credit facility did not have a commitment from Lehman. With the exception of the $60 million in commitments under our $1.25 billion facility, we believe that the lenders under our revolving credit facilities are capable of meeting any borrowing requests we may make. On September 25, 2008, we issued a borrowing request for $300 million under our $1.25 billion credit facility in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The Lehman portion of the commitment was not funded, resulting in a total funding of $286 million, which represented the total amount outstanding under our revolving credit facilities as of September 26, 2008. Based on our cash flow forecast, we believe we will continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs, even if Lehman remains unable or unwilling to participate or if another lender does not assume Lehmans commitment in the future. Our ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related cost of these borrowings, is affected by market conditions and our short term borrowing rating. As of June 27, 2008, we had outstanding commercial paper borrowings of $358 million, all of which were scheduled to mature during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. While the Company had the intent to refinance these outstanding borrowings through the commercial paper market, we have experienced limitations in our ability to access this market. As of September 26, 2008, we were successful in refinancing $116 million of the commercial paper outstanding as of June 27, 2008 with new commercial paper issuance. The remaining balance was refinanced under our $1.25 billion credit facility. Our multi year revolving credit facilities serve as a backstop to our commercial paper program. It is our intention to fund future maturities of commercial paper through new commercial paper issuances or additional borrowing from our credit facilities. As of November 12, 2008, $686 million was outstanding under our revolving credit facility. In addition to our available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of potential liquidity include committed credit lines, our commercial paper program, public debt and equity markets as well as the ability to sell trade accounts receivable. We continue to balance our cash operating, investing and financing uses of cash through investment in our existing core businesses, strategic acquisitions and divestitures, dividends and share repurchases. We believe our cash position, amounts available under our credit facilities and cash provided by operating activities will be adequate to cover our operational and business needs. As a result of declines experienced in global financial markets, our pension funds have and may continue to experience a negative return which will result in an increase in pension costs in 2009. We will continue to monitor the market conditions and assess the impact, if any, on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Approximately 100% of our U.S. and 97% of our non U.S. funded pension plans are invested in readily liquid investments, including equity and fixed income securities. Although we do not believe we will be required to make a material cash contribution in the next 12 months, if these 65 market conditions continue, we may be required to make incremental cash contributions under the Pension Protection Act in the U.S. or other local statutory law. The sources of our cash flow from operating activities and the use of a portion of that cash in our operations for the years ended September 26, 2008, September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006 were as follows ($ in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Cash flows from operating activities: Operating income (loss) $ 1,941 $ (1,732 ) $ 1,355 Goodwill impairment 9 46 Non cash restructuring and asset impairment charges, net 37 24 2 Losses on divestitures 4 2 Depreciation and amortization(1) 1,154 1,148 1,180 Non cash compensation expense 99 173 151 Deferred income taxes (94 ) (16 ) (413 ) Provision for losses on accounts receivable and inventory 135 94 55 Loss on the retirement of debt 258 259 1 Other, net (124 ) (231 ) (37 ) Class action settlement liability (3,020 ) 2,992 Net change in working capital (646 ) (414 ) 223 Interest income 110 104 46 Interest expense (396 ) (313 ) (279 ) Income tax expense (335 ) (324 ) (304 ) Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities $ (872 ) $ 1,814 $ 1,982 Other cash flow items: Capital expenditures, net(2) $ (706 ) $ (643 ) $ (517 ) Decrease in sale of accounts receivable 14 7 8 Acquisition of customer accounts (ADT dealer program) (376 ) (409 ) (373 ) Purchase accounting and holdback liabilities (2 ) (10 ) (7 ) Voluntary pension contributions 4 23 (1)Includes depreciation expense of $626 million, $635 million and $663 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and amortization of intangible assets of $528 million, $513 million and $517 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. (2)Includes net proceeds of $28 million, $23 million and $39 million received for the sale/disposition of property, plant and equipment in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The net change in working capital decreased operating cash flow by $646 million in 2008. The components of this change are set forth in detail in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The significant changes in working capital included a $176 million increase in accounts receivable, a $138 million increase in inventories, and a $152 million decrease in accrued and other liabilities, primarily due to accrued warranties. During the second quarter of 2008, Tyco released $2,960 million of funds placed in escrow during the third quarter of 2007 as well as $60 million of interest earned on those funds for the benefit of the class as stipulated in the Courts final order related to the class action settlement. During 2008, we substantially completed the sale of our Infrastructure Services business for net cash proceeds of $396 million, sold 100% of the stock of ETEO for $338 million in net cash proceeds, sold Ancon Building Products for $171 million in net cash proceeds, and completed the sale of NDC for $49 million in net cash proceeds. We continue to fund capital expenditures to improve the cost structure of our businesses, to invest in new processes and technology, and to maintain high quality production standards. The level of capital expenditures in 2009 is expected to exceed spending levels in 2008 of $734 million and is also expected to exceed depreciation of $626 million. 66 On July 10, 2008, Tycos Board of Directors approved a $1.0 billion share repurchase program under which we have repurchased 2.5 million common shares for $100 million. We also repurchased 23.1 million common shares for $944 million in 2008 completing the 2007 $1.0 billion share repurchase program. During 2007, we repurchased 1.3 million common shares for $56 million under the 2007 $1.0 billion share repurchase program as well as 5 million common shares for $659 million completing the 2006 $2.0 billion share repurchase program. During 2006, we repurchased 13 million common shares for $1.3 billion under the 2006 $2.0 billion share repurchase program as well as 11 million common shares for $1.2 billion completing the 2005 $1.5 billion share repurchase program. During the first quarter of 2007, we launched a company wide restructuring program, which as of September 26, 2008 has been substantially completed. Since the inception of this program, we have incurred charges of $395 million relating to this program. During 2008, 2007 and 2006 we paid out $187 million, $70 million and $32 million, respectively, in cash related to restructuring activities. We have identified additional opportunities for cost savings from restructuring activities in fiscal 2009 and expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately $50 million in fiscal 2009. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our restructuring activities. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, related to continuing operations was $501 million, $649 million, and $316 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, Tyco paid $376 million, $409 million and $373 million of cash, respectively, to acquire approximately 370,000, 415,000 and 401,000 customer contracts for electronic security services through the ADT dealer program. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, we paid $2 million, $10 million and $7 million, respectively, in cash for purchase accounting and holdback liabilities. Holdback liabilities represent a portion of the purchase price withheld from the seller pending finalization of the acquisition balance sheet and other contingencies. At September 26, 2008 holdback liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets were $18 million, which are included in other liabilities. At September 26, 2008, $12 million of acquisition liabilities remained on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, of which $3 million are included in accrued and other current liabilities and $9 million are included in other liabilities. As previously discussed, effective June 29, 2007, we completed the Separation. In connection with the Separation, we paid $68 million, $349 million and $96 million in Separation costs during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Of these amounts, $36 million, $256 million and $77 million were included in cash flows from discontinued operating activities, respectively. As previously discussed, we continue to be active in refining our portfolio and assessing the strategic fit of our various businesses. As a result, we will continue to divest of businesses that do not align with our overall strategy. We plan to use the expected proceeds from these sales, as well as the cash generated by our operations, to continue to make investments in our businesses that are intended to grow revenue and improve productivity, including our restructuring actions. We expect to also use cash to selectively pursue acquisitions. Additionally, we expect to continue to return any excess cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments. Pursuant to our share repurchase program, we may repurchase Tyco shares from time to time in open market purchases at prevailing market prices, in negotiated transactions off the market, or pursuant to an approved 10b5 1 trading plan in accordance with applicable regulations. Management believes that cash generated by or available to us should be sufficient to fund our capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future, including quarterly dividend payments. The Company intends to repurchase additional shares under its existing $1.0 billion share repurchase program depending on credit market conditions, macroeconomic factors and expectations regarding future cash flows. 67 Capitalization Shareholders equity was $15.5 billion or $32.41 per share, at September 26, 2008, compared to $15.6 billion or $31.50 per share, at September 28, 2007. Shareholders equity did not change significantly in 2008 due to net income of $1,553 million, which was offset by the repurchase of common shares by subsidiary of $854 million, the repurchase of common shares held in Treasury of $192 million, dividends declared of $313 million and foreign currency exchange rates of $307 million. Total debt was $4.3 billion at September 26, 2008, as compared to $4.5 billion at September 28, 2007. Total debt as a percentage of capitalization (total debt and shareholders equity) was 22% at both September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007, respectively. Our cash balance decreased to $1.5 billion at September 26, 2008, as compared to $1.9 billion at September 28, 2007. This decrease in cash was primarily due to the repurchase of common shares, capital expenditures, accounts purchased from the ADT dealer network, business acquisitions and dividends paid. This decrease was offset by cash generated by the operating segments and proceeds from divestitures. Debt Tenders In connection with the settlement of litigation arising from the Separation related to our public debt, on June 3, 2008 we, along with our finance subsidiary Tyco International Finance S.A. ("TIFSA"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and successor company to Tyco International Group S.A. ("TIGSA"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company organized under the laws of Luxembourg, consummated consent solicitations and exchange offers related to certain series of debt issued under the 1998 and 2003 indentures. In connection with the exchange offers, we issued $422 million principal amount of 7.0% notes due 2019 in exchange for an equal principal amount of 7.0% notes due 2028 and $707 million principal amount of 6.875% notes due 2021 in exchange for an equal principal amount of 6.875% notes due 2029. In connection with the consent solicitations, holders of our 6.0% notes due 2013, 6.125% notes due 2008, 6.125% notes due 2009, 6.75% notes due 2011, 6.375% notes due 2011, 7.0% notes due 2028 and 6.875% notes due 2029 collectively received consent payments totaling $250 million. The terms of the consent and exchange offers were evaluated as a debt modification in accordance with EITF No. 96 19, "Debtors Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of Debt Instruments," and it was determined that the 7.0% notes due 2028 and the 6.875% notes due 2029 were extinguished because the cash flows of the new bonds as compared to the original bonds were substantially modified. As a result, the new bonds and the 7.0% notes due 2028 and the 6.875% notes due 2029 that were not tendered for exchange were recorded at their fair value upon completion of the exchange offers. In determining fair value, we measured the bonds as if they were an initial issuance to the public. This was done by obtaining effective yield data derived from comparable pricing received from the issuance of bonds with similar ratings and covenants by large public companies. In connection with the consent solicitations and exchange offers, we recorded a $222 million charge to other expense, net as a loss on extinguishment of debt. This charge is comprised of the consent payments related to the extinguished bonds (notes due 2028 and 2029), premium on the exchanged bonds which represents the difference between the fair value and the book value of the extinguished bonds and the write off of the original unamortized debt issuance costs as well as fees paid to third parties associated with the bonds that were not deemed extinguished. The remaining portion of the consent payment and issuance costs will be amortized over the remaining life of the bonds. In May 2008, TIFSA commenced issuing commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are 68 available for general corporate purposes. As of September 26, 2008, TIFSA had $116 million of commercial paper outstanding, which bore interest at an average rate of 2.95%. During the year ended September 28, 2007, we recorded a $259 million charge to other expense, net for the loss on early extinguishment of debt related to the debt tender offers in connection with the Separation. Bank and Revolving Credit Facilities On June 24, 2008, Tyco and TIFSA entered into a $500 million senior unsecured revolving credit agreement with Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent for the lenders party thereto. This credit agreement has a three year term. Borrowings under this agreement have a variable interest rate based on LIBOR or an alternate base rate. The margin over LIBOR can vary based on changes in our credit rating and facility utilization. Together with the existing $1.25 billion five year senior revolving credit agreement, dated as of April 25, 2007, our total commitments under these facilities increased to $1.75 billion. These revolving credit facilities will be used for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes. As of September 26, 2008, there was $286 million drawn under these unsecured revolving credit facilities and as of November 12, 2008 we had $686 million outstanding. As discussed above, with the exception of the $60 million in commitments from Lehman, we believe that all of the lenders under our revolving credit facility are capable of meeting any borrowing requests TIFSA may make. On April 25, 2007, we, certain of our subsidiaries and a syndicate of banks entered into a 364 day unsecured bridge loan facility. On October 1, 2007, the commitments with respect to the unused portion of our unsecured bridge loan facility expired, but were subsequently renewed before being terminated in connection with the overall facilitys termination in June 2008. The unsecured bridge loan facility provided us with sufficient liquidity to repay our outstanding public debt with borrowings of up to $4.0 billion. The facility could only be used to repay, settle or otherwise extinguish such public debt, which was the subject of ongoing litigation between us and the trustee for such public debt. In June 2008, we settled this litigation and terminated this facility. In connection with the facility termination, we recorded a $36 million charge to other expense, net to write off unamortized debt issuance costs. On June 21, 2007, Tyco and TIFSA entered into a $500 million letter of credit facility, with Citibank N.A. as administrative agent, that was scheduled to expire on June 15, 2008. The facility provided for the issuance of letters of credit supported by a related line of credit facility. Effective June 6, 2008, this facility and all commitments under this facility were terminated. TIFSAs bank credit agreements contain customary terms and conditions, and financial covenants that limit the ratio of our debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and that limit our ability to incur subsidiary debt or grant liens on our property. Our indentures contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges, subsidiary debt and sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are considered restrictive to our business. Convertible Debentures As of September 28, 2007, TIFSA had $21 million outstanding of its 3.125% convertible senior debentures due 2023 with a 2015 put option ("the 3.125% convertible senior debentures"). On August 25, 2008, we delivered to holders a notice of redemption of our $19 million remaining principal amount of the 3.125% convertible senior debentures. These debentures were originally convertible into Tyco shares. As a result of the Separation transactions undertaken by us in 2007, these debentures became convertible into common shares of Tyco International Ltd., Covidien Ltd. and Tyco Electronics Ltd. The 3.125% convertible debentures were converted into 11.496 common shares of each of the three separate companies, per $1,000 principal amount. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, we issued 217,589 shares of Tyco common stock and obtained shares of Covidien Ltd. and Tyco Electronics in connection with the redemption of the 3.125% convertible senior debentures. 69 Additionally in the fourth quarter, we recorded a gain of $6 million upon exercise of the conversion option by holders (see Note 15 in the Consolidated Financial Statements). The last redemption date was September 25, 2008. Any notes outstanding after that date were redeemed with available cash. As of September 26, 2008, no amounts remain outstanding under the 3.125% convertible senior debentures.

Commitments and Contingencies Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations and commitments for principal debt, minimum lease payment obligations under non cancelable operating leases and other obligations at September 26, 2008 is as follows ($ in millions): 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Debt(1) $ 648 $ 1 $ 517 $ 1,135 $ 1 $ 1,831 $ 4,133 Interest payments(2) 225 209 192 148 120 619 1,513 Capital leases(3) 23 21 22 4 6 43 119 Operating leases 248 201 166 108 61 140 924 Purchase obligations(4) 53 3 56 Total contractual cash obligations(5)(6) $ 1,197 $ 435 $ 897 $ 1,395 $ 188 $ 2,633 $ 6,745 (1)Excludes debt discount and swap activity. Includes amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facilities. Included in the amount of debt maturing in 2009 is $116 million of commercial paper borrowings the Company classified as long term at September 26, 2008. This debt matures in 2009, but has been classified as long term on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as settlement of this debt is not expected to require the use of working capital in the next year and as the Company has both the intent and the ability to refinance this debt on a long term basis. (2)Interest payments consist of interest on our fixed interest rate debt and excludes interest on our variable interest rate debt. (3)Excludes interest. (4)Purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of good and services. (5)Other long term liabilities primarily consist of the following: pension and postretirement costs, income taxes, warranty and environmental liabilities and are excluded from this table. We are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type. The minimum required contributions to our pension plans are expected to be approximately $63 million in 2009 and we expect to pay $7 million in 2009 related to postretirement benefit plans. (6)During the first quarter of 2008, we adopted the provisions of FIN No. 48. As of September 26, 2008, we recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $369 million and gross interest and penalties of $49 million, both of which are classified as non current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as payment is not expected within one year. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing for such payments in future years; therefore, such amounts have been excluded from the above contractual obligation table. 70 Our 6.125% public notes due in 2008 and 2009 of $300 million and $215 million mature in the first and second quarter of fiscal year 2009, respectively. Based on market conditions and our liquidity needs, we intend to pay down these maturities of such debt either by drawing down on our existing credit facility or accessing the debt market on terms that are acceptable to the Company. As of November 12, 2008, the total outstanding balance under our credit facility was $686 million. On June 24, 2008, Tyco and TIFSA entered into a new $500 million senior unsecured revolving credit agreement with Citibank, N.A. as administrative agent for the lenders party therto. This credit agreement has a three year term. Borrowings under this agreement have a variable interest rate based on LIBOR or an alternate base rate. The margin over LIBOR can vary based on changes in our credit rating and facility utilization. Together with the existing $1.25 billion five year senior revolving credit agreement, dated as of April 25, 2007, our total commitments under these facilities increased to $1.75 billion. As discussed above, as of September 26, 2008, we had total commitments of $1.75 billion under our revolving credit facilities, $500 million of which matures on June 24, 2011 and $1.25 billion of which matures on April 25, 2012. Additionally, $60 million worth of commitments under our $1.25 billion facility are held by Lehman which has defaulted on it obligations under the agreement. As of September 26, 2008, $286 million was outstanding under our revolving credit facilities, and as of November 12, 2008, $686 million was outstanding. At September 26, 2008, we had total outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees of $633 million. In May 2008, TIFSA commenced issuing commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes. As of September 26, 2008, TIFSA had $116 million of commercial paper outstanding which bore interest at an average rate of 2.95%. At September 26, 2008 we classified $116 million of short term borrowings as long term. Settlement of this debt is not expected to require the use of working capital in the next year, as we have both the intent and the ability to refinance this debt on a long term basis. In the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In connection with the Separation, we entered into a liability sharing agreement regarding certain class actions that were pending against Tyco prior to the Separation. Under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, we, Covidien and Tyco Electronics are jointly and severally liable for the full amount of any judgments resulting from the actions subject to the agreement, which generally relate to legacy claims (including ERISA, FCPA and securities claims). The Separation and Distribution Agreement also provides that we will be responsible for 27%, Covidien 42% and Tyco Electronics 31% of payments to resolve these matters, with costs and expenses associated with the management of these contingencies being shared equally among the parties. In addition, under the agreement, we will manage and control all the legal matters related to assumed contingent liabilities as described in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, including the defense or settlement thereof, subject to certain limitations. 71  Tyco has assumed 27%, Covidien has assumed 42% and Tyco Electronics has assumed 31% of certain Tyco pre Separation contingent and other corporate liabilities, which include securities class action litigation, Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA") class action litigation, certain legacy tax contingencies and any actions with respect to the spin offs or the distributions made or brought by any third party. Any amounts relating to these contingent and other corporate liabilities paid by Tyco after the spin offs that are subject to the allocation provisions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement will be shared among Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics pursuant to the same allocation ratio. As described in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Tyco, Tyco Electronics and Covidien are jointly and severally liable for all amounts relating to the previously disclosed securities class action settlement. All costs and expenses that Tyco incurs in connection with the defense of such litigation, other than the amount of any judgment or settlement, which will be allocated in the manner described above, will be borne equally by Covidien, Tyco Electronics and Tyco. Legal Matters Class Actions For a discussion of contingencies related to Tycos securities class actions, class action settlement, ERISA related litigation and Tyco litigation against former senior management, litigation related to our public debt and various other legal matters, see Item 3, Legal Proceedings. We are generally obligated to indemnify our directors and officers and our former directors and officers who are named as defendants in some or all of these matters to the extent required by Bermuda law. While we may from time to time seek to engage plaintiffs counsel in settlement discussions, we are unable at this time to estimate what our ultimate liability in these matters may be, and it is possible that we will be required to pay judgments or settlements and incur expenses, in excess of any insurance coverage, in aggregate amounts that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Investigations For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to governmental investigations related to Tyco, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Subpoenas and Document Requests From Governmental Entities. We cannot predict when these investigations will be completed, nor can we predict what the results of these investigations may be. It is possible that we will be required to pay material fines, consent to injunctions on future conduct, lose the ability to conduct business with government entities or instrumentalities (which in turn could negatively impact our business with non governmental customers) or suffer other penalties or adverse impacts, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. It is not possible to estimate the amount of loss, or range of possible loss, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters. Environmental Matters Tyco is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos environmental matters, see Item 1. Business Environmental Matters and Item 3. Legal Proceedings Environmental Matters. Asbestos Matters Tyco and some of its subsidiaries are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials. For a detailed discussion of Tycos contingencies related to these matters, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Asbestos Matters. 72 Income Taxes Tyco and its subsidiaries income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. The Company is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest have been assessed under FIN 48 and recorded as appropriate. For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos income taxes, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Income Tax Matters. Compliance Matters Tyco has received and responded to various allegations and other information that improper activities were conducted by Tyco employees in recent years, in particular with respect to DOJ and SEC investigations that have resulted in our performing a company wide baseline review of our policies, controls and practices as they relate to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. For a detailed discussion of these contingencies and others related to Tycos compliance efforts, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Compliance Matters. Other Matters The Company is a defendant in a number of other pending legal proceedings incidental to present and former operations, acquisitions and dispositions. The Company does not expect the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Backlog At September 26, 2008, we had a backlog of unfilled orders of $9.7 billion, compared to a backlog of $9.0 billion at September 28, 2007. We expect that approximately 86% of our backlog at September 26, 2008 will be filled during 2009. Backlog by segment at September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007 is as follows ($ in millions): 2008 2007 ADT Worldwide $ 6,177 $ 6,137 Flow Control 2,083 1,579 Fire Protection Services 1,139 1,048 Electrical and Metal Products 117 114 Safety Products 154 132 $ 9,670 $ 9,010 Within ADT Worldwide, backlog increased primarily as a result of recurring revenue in force, which represents 12 months fees for monitoring and maintenance services under contract in the security business. Our total account base grew 1.6% year over year to 7.2 million accounts. The amount of recurring revenue in force at September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007 was $3.97 billion and $3.93 billion, respectively. Flow Control had increased bookings mostly in the Asia Pacific and Americas regions. Backlog within Fire Protection Services increased primarily as a result of increased orders in Asia and North America. 73  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale of Accounts Receivable Certain of Tycos international businesses utilize the sale of accounts receivable as short term financing mechanisms. The aggregate amount outstanding under the Companys remaining international accounts receivable programs was $65 million, $76 million and $75 million at September 26, 2008, September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006, respectively. Guarantees Certain of the Companys business segments have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from 2008 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. There are certain guarantees or indemnifications extended among Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics in accordance with the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Tax Sharing Agreement. The guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the Tax Sharing Agreement. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Tax Sharing Agreement. At the time of the Separation, Tyco recorded a liability necessary to recognize the fair value of such guarantees and indemnifications in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation ("FIN") No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." In the absence of observable transactions for identical or similar guarantees, the Company determined the fair value of these guarantees and indemnifications utilizing expected present value measurement techniques. Significant assumptions utilized to determine fair value included determining a range of potential outcomes, assigning a probability weighting to each potential outcome and estimating the anticipated timing of resolution. The probability weighted outcomes were discounted using the Companys incremental borrowing rate. The liability necessary to reflect the fair value of the guarantees and indemnifications under the Tax Sharing Agreement is $554 million and $543 million, which is included in other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007, respectively. The guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the Tax Sharing Agreement. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Tax Sharing Agreement. In addition, Tyco historically provided support in the form of financial and or performance guarantees to various Covidien and Tyco Electronics operating entities. In connection with the Separation, the Company worked with the guarantee counterparties to cancel or assign these guarantees to Covidien or Tyco Electronics. To the extent these guarantees were not assigned prior to the Separation date, Tyco assumed primary liability on any remaining support. The estimated fair values of those obligations are $7 million, which are included in other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and were recorded in accordance with FIN No. 45 with an offset to shareholders equity on the Separation date. In disposing of assets or businesses, the Company often provides representations, warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. The Company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 74  The Company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. In the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company records estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. For further information on estimated product warranty, see Notes 1 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2001, a division of Safety Products initiated a Voluntary Replacement Program ("VRP") associated with the acquisition of Central Sprinkler. The VRP relates to the replacement of certain O ring seal sprinkler heads which were originally manufactured by Central Sprinkler prior to Tycos acquisition. Under this program, the sprinkler heads are being replaced free of charge to property owners. In the third quarter of 2006, the Company completed a comprehensive review of reported claims, recent claim rates and cost trends and further assessed the future of the program. The Company determined that an additional liability was necessary in order to satisfy the Companys obligation under the VRP. As a result, the Company recorded a $100 million charge which was reflected in cost of sales. On May 1, 2007, the Consumer Products Safety Commission and the Company announced an August 31, 2007 deadline for filing claims to participate in the VRP. The Company will fulfill all valid claims for replacement of qualifying sprinklers received up to August 31, 2007. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company further assessed the expected cost to complete the program in light of the most current claims data and determined that an additional accrual of $10 million was necessary to satisfy the estimated remaining obligation. The ultimate cost to complete the program will be impacted by a number of factors such as changes in material and labor costs, and the actual number of sprinkler heads replaced. Actual results could differ from this estimate. Settlements during 2008 include cash expenditures of $49 million related to the VRP.  Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation ("FIN") No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109." This Interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. FIN No. 48 became effective for Tyco in the first quarter of 2008. As a result of adopting FIN No. 48, Tyco increased its reserve for uncertain tax positions by $55 million and reduced its deferred tax assets by $24 million with a corresponding $79 million cumulative effect adjustment to shareholders equity. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the adoption of FIN No. 48. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In May 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 162, "The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles" (SFAS No. 162). SFAS No. 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements. SFAS No. 162 is effective 60 days following the SECs approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411, "The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles". The Company does not expect that this standard will have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In April 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position ("FSP") No. 142 3, "Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets". FSP No. 142 3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset 75 under SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets". FSP No. 142 3 is effective for Tyco in the first quarter of 2010. The Company is currently assessing the impact of FSP No. 142 3 on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, "Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS No. 161 is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entitys results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 161 are effective for Tyco in the second quarter of 2009. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 141 (Revised 2007), "Business Combinations." SFAS No. 141R retains the underlying concepts of SFAS No. 141 in that business combinations are still accounted for at fair value. However, the accounting for certain other aspects of business combinations will be affected. Acquisition costs will generally be expensed as incurred. Restructuring costs associated with a business combination will generally be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date. In process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible at the acquisition date until it is completed or abandoned and its useful life can be determined. Changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions after the acquisition date will generally impact income tax expense. SFAS No. 141R also expands required disclosures surrounding the nature and financial effects of business combinations. SFAS No. 141R is effective, on a prospective basis, for Tyco in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51". SFAS No. 160 requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest (minority interest prior to the adoption of SFAS 160) as equity in the consolidated financial statements. The amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest should be included in consolidated net income on the face of the statement of income. SFAS No. 160 also amends certain of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51s consolidation procedures in order to achieve consistency with the requirements of SFAS No. 141R. The statement also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest. This statement is effective for Tyco in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The Company is currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 160 on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities." SFAS No. 159 permits an entity, on a contract by contract basis, to make an irrevocable election to account for certain types of financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value, rather than historical cost, with changes in the fair value, whether realized or unrealized, recognized in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for Tyco in the first quarter of 2009. The Company is currently assessing the impact that SFAS No. 159 will have on the results of its operations, financial position or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements," which enhances existing guidance for measuring assets and liabilities at fair value. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 157 1, "Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB Statement No. 13 and Other Accounting Pronouncements That Address Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease Classification or Measurement under Statement 13", to exclude SFAS No, 13, "Accounting for Leases" and other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements for purposes of lease classification or measurement under SFAS No. 13, and FASB Staff Position No. 157 2, "Effective Date of FASB Statement No 157" that permits companies to partially defer the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for one year for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 157 3, "Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active", clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157 for a financial 76 asset in an in active market. During the first quarter of 2009 the Company elected to defer the adoption of SFAS No. 157 for one year for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. SFAS No. 157 is effective for Tyco in the first quarter of 2009. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, that SFAS No. 157 will have on the results of its operations, financial position or cash flows. In September 2006, FASB issued SFAS No. 158, "Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)." SFAS No. 158 requires that employers recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as a net asset or liability on the balance sheet and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. The company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158 as of September 28, 2007. SFAS No. 158 also requires companies to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of their fiscal year end. The Company presently uses a measurement date of August 31st. The measurement date provisions become effective in fiscal 2009. The Company is currently assessing the impact that SFAS No. 158 measurement date provisions will have on the results of its operations, financial position or cash flows. In June 2008 the FASB ratified FASB Staff Position No. EITF 03 6 1, "Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions are Participating Securities" (FSP No. EITF 03 6 1), which addresses whether instruments granted in share based payment awards are participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, must be included in the earnings allocation in calculating earnings per share under the two class method described in SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per Share" (SFAS No. 128). FSP No. EITF 03 6 1 requires that unvested share based payment awards that contain non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents be treated as participating securities in calculating earnings per share. FSP No. EITF 03 6 1 is effective for Tyco in fiscal 2010 and interim periods within those fiscal years, and shall be applied retrospectively to all prior periods. We are currently evaluating the effects, if any that FSP No. EITF 03 6 1 may have on earnings per share.  Forward Looking Information Certain statements in this report are "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. All statements contained herein that are not clearly historical in nature are forward looking, and the words "anticipate," "believe," "expect," "estimate," "project" and similar expressions are generally intended to identify forward looking statements. Any forward looking statement contained herein, in press releases, written statements or other documents filed with the Security and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), or in Tycos communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, web casts, phone calls and conference calls, regarding expectations with respect to sales, earnings, cash flows, operating efficiencies, product expansion, backlog, the consummation and benefits of acquisitions and divestitures, as well as financings and repurchases of debt or equity securities, are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and contingencies. Many of these risks, uncertainties and contingencies are beyond our control, and may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from anticipated results, performance or achievements. Factors that might affect such forward looking statements include, among other things: overall economic and business conditions; the demand for Tycos goods and services; competitive factors in the industries in which Tyco competes; 77 changes in tax requirements (including tax rate changes, new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations); results and consequences of Tycos internal investigation and governmental investigations concerning the Companys governance, management, internal controls and operations including its business operations outside the United States; the outcome of litigation and governmental proceedings; effect of income tax audit settlements; the ratings on our debt and our ability to repay or refinance our outstanding indebtedness as it matures; our ability to operate within the limitations imposed by financing arrangements and to maintain our credit ratings; interest rate fluctuations and other changes in borrowing costs; other capital market conditions, including availability of funding sources and currency exchange rate fluctuations; availability of and fluctuations in the prices of key raw materials, including steel and copper; economic and political conditions in international markets, including governmental changes and restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders; the ability to achieve cost savings in connection with the Companys strategic restructuring and Six Sigma initiatives; potential further impairment of our goodwill and or our long lived assets; the impact of fluctuations in the price of Tyco common shares; changes in U.S. and non U.S. governmental laws and regulations; and the possible effects on Tyco of future legislation in the United States that may limit or eliminate potential U.S. tax benefits resulting from Tycos incorporation in Bermuda or deny U.S. government contracts to Tyco based upon its incorporation in Bermuda.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the ordinary course of conducting business, we are exposed to certain risks associated with potential changes in market conditions. These risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Accordingly, we have established a comprehensive risk management process to monitor, evaluate and manage the principal exposures we believe we are subject to. We seek to manage these risks through the use of financial derivative instruments. Our portfolio of derivative financial instruments may, from time to time, include forward foreign currency exchange contracts, cross currency swaps, foreign currency options, and interest rate swaps. Derivative financial instruments related to interest rate sensitivity of debt obligations, intercompany cross border transactions and anticipated non functional currency cash flows are used with the goal of mitigating a significant portion of these exposures when it is cost effective to do so. We do not execute transactions or utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, to reduce the risk that a counterparty will be unable to honor its contractual obligations to us, we only enter into contracts with counterparties having at least an A/A2 long term debt rating. These counterparties are generally financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one party. During fiscal year 2007, the Company elected to change its presentation of market risk information from a tabular format to a disclosure based on the results of sensitivity analysis. Management believes this method of presentation provides more useful information for assessing the Companys overall 78 exposure to market risks. The results of our sensitivity analysis represent an estimate of reasonably possible outcomes based on hypothetical market conditions and are not necessarily indicative of actual results. Foreign Currency Exposures We hedge our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts and options. During 2008, our largest exposures to foreign exchange rates existed primarily with the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar against the U.S. Dollar. The market risk related to the forward foreign exchange contracts is measured by estimating the potential impact of a 10% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates. The rates used to perform this analysis were based on the market rates in effect on September 26, 2008. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in a $57 million net increase in the fair value of the contracts. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in a $69 million net decrease in the fair value of the contracts. However, gains or losses on these derivative instruments are economically offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. Previously, we hedged our investment in certain foreign operations. In December 2006, due to required changes to the legal entity structure to facilitate the Separation, the Company determined that it would no longer consider certain intercompany foreign currency transactions to be long term investments. As a result, the related foreign currency transaction gains and losses on such investments were recorded in the income statement subsequent to this determination rather than in the currency translation component of shareholders equity. Forward contracts that were previously designated as hedges of these net investments continued to be used to manage this exposure but were no longer designated as net investment hedges. Also in connection with the Separation and the debt tender, the Company re designated its 6.125% Euro denominated public notes due 2007 on March 29, 2007, its 5.5% Euro denominated public notes due 2008 and its 6.5% British Pound denominated public notes due 2031 on May 21, 2007, that had previously been considered as hedges of net investments in certain foreign operations. At September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007, the Company did not hedge its net investment in foreign operations, we had no net investment hedges and all of its outstanding borrowings were denominated in U.S. dollars. During 2008, we designated certain intercompany loans as permanent in nature, in the amount of $2.1 billion as of September 26, 2008. As a result, the Company recorded $141 million of cumulative translation adjustment through accumulated other comprehensive income as of September 26, 2008 related to these loans. Interest Rate Exposures Our long term debt portfolio primarily consists of fixed rate instruments. Historically, the Company managed its exposure to interest rates by entering into interest rate and cross currency swaps designated as fair value hedges. In assessing the potential risks related to movements in interest rates, we terminated the interest rate and cross currency swaps in several tranches beginning in the fourth quarter of 2006. During the first quarter of 2007, we terminated the remaining contracts with a total notional amount of $0.6 billion, resulting in an aggregate terminated notional amount of $3.1 billion. The settlement of these swaps resulted in a net cash inflow of $63 million for the first quarter of 2007. Since the interest rate swaps were designated as hedging instruments of outstanding debt, the related $32 million loss adjustment reported in 2007 to the carrying value of the related debt will be amortized over the remaining life of the related debt instruments. Of this amount, $3 million and $18 million have been amortized in 2008 and 2007, respectively. In connection with the debt tender offer, $9 million of unamortized loss on interest rate swaps was accelerated and recorded in 2007 as a loss on retirement of debt and included in other expense, net (see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial 79 Statements). At September 28, 2007, there were no interest rate swaps outstanding. During 2008, the Company did not enter into any interest rate or cross currency swaps, but may consider such strategies in the future. Commodity Exposures We are exposed to volatility in the prices of raw materials used in some of our products and may, in limited circumstances, enter into hedging contracts to manage those exposures. These exposures are monitored as an integral part of our risk management program. During 2008, the Company did not hedge its exposure attributable to changes in commodity prices but may consider such strategies in the future.
