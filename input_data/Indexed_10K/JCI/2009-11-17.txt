Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the Selected Financial Data and our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those under the headings "Risk Factors" and "Forward Looking Information." Introduction The Consolidated Financial Statements include the consolidated results of Tyco International Ltd., a company organized under the laws of Switzerland, and its subsidiaries (hereinafter collectively referred to as "we," the "Company" or "Tyco"). The financial statements have been prepared in United States dollars ("USD") and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Company operates in the following business segments: ADT Worldwide designs, sells, installs, services and monitors electronic security systems for residential, commercial, industrial and governmental customers. Flow Control designs, manufactures, sells and services valves, pipes, fittings, valve automation and heat tracing products for the oil, gas and other energy markets along with general process industries and the water and wastewater markets. Fire Protection Services designs, sells, installs and services fire detection and fire suppression systems for commercial, industrial and governmental customers. Electrical and Metal Products designs, manufactures and sells galvanized steel tubing, armored wire and cable and other metal products for non residential construction, electrical, fire and safety and mechanical customers. Safety Products designs, manufactures and sells fire suppression, electronic, security and life safety products, including fire suppression products, breathing apparatus, intrusion security, access control and video management systems. In addition, Safety Products manufactures products installed and serviced by ADT Worldwide and Fire Protection Services. We also provide general corporate services to our segments and these costs are reported as Corporate and Other. References to the segment data are to the Companys continuing operations. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The Company has realigned certain business operations as of September 27, 2008, which resulted in certain prior period segment amounts being recast. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Overview and Outlook Overall, fiscal year 2009 results were negatively affected by the economic downturn, which adversely impacted our businesses across nearly all geographies and industries. Revenue decreased by $3.0 billion, or 14.7%, compared to 2008, and goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges were largely responsible for an operating loss of $1.5 billion for the year, compared to operating income of $1.9 billion in 2008. Approximately one half of the 2009 revenue decline was due to the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar during 2009, as over half of our revenue is generated outside the U.S. The remaining revenue decline was due in large part to our Electrical and Metal Products business, 35 Table of Contents which saw historically low volumes in 2009. The impact of the weakened global economy on product and systems installation revenue also significantly contributed to the year over year decline. On the other hand, service revenue continued to grow as a percentage of our overall revenue, from 35% in 2008 to 39% in 2009. Our service revenues are principally derived from our ADT Worldwide and Fire Protection Services businesses, and represent a predictable and consistent source of revenue. Recurring revenue in our ADT Worldwide business now represents approximately 55% of ADTs total revenue compared to approximately 50% in 2008. In the Fire Protection Services business, service revenue increased as a percentage of Fire Protections total revenue from 48% in 2008 to 49% in 2009. Operating income declined in 2009 compared to 2008 due in large part to non cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of approximately $2.7 billion during 2009. Operating income was also negatively affected by charges related to restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture activity of approximately $251 million and charges related to legacy legal matters of approximately $125 million. To a lesser degree, operating income was negatively impacted by reduced volumes due to the economic downturn. Operating income benefited from a number of key cost containment actions taken in 2009 and 2008, as well as restructuring actions taken in prior periods. We continue to be aggressive in identifying cost saving opportunities and restructuring activities that should benefit the Company when the economy improves. During 2010, we expect to incur an additional $100 million to $150 million of charges related to restructuring activity. As of September 25, 2009, the Companys cash balance was $2.4 billion, as compared to $1.5 billion as of September 26, 2008. The increase from 2008 to 2009 was primarily due to cash flow from operating activities and proceeds received from the issuance of long term debt. In 2010, we expect to continue to use our cash to fund internal growth opportunities, improve productivity across all of our businesses, make acquisitions that strategically fit within our ADT Worldwide, Fire Protection Services and Flow Control businesses and return capital to shareholders. In 2010, we expect to continue our portfolio refinement efforts by exiting areas that have not provided, and are not expected to provide, an adequate return on investment. Finally, in 2010, we will continue to focus on growing revenue in key emerging markets and, as noted above, taking advantage of restructuring opportunities that are expected to provide significant future cost savings. Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairments Annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, and more frequently if triggering events occur, the Company tests goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible assets with its carrying amount. During the second quarter of 2009, the Company concluded that its EMEA Security and EMEA Fire reporting units within the ADT Worldwide and Fire Protection Services segments, respectively, Electrical and Metal Products reporting unit within the Electrical and Metal Products segment and Access Control and Video Systems ("ACVS"), Life Safety and Sensormatic Retail Solutions ("SRS") reporting units within the Safety Products segment experienced triggering events such that the carrying values of these reporting units likely exceeded their fair values. As a result of the triggering events, the Company performed long lived asset, goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests for these reporting units and certain of the Companys trade names and franchise rights. The results of the goodwill impairment tests indicated that the implied goodwill amount was less than the carrying amount of goodwill for each of the aforementioned reporting units. The Company recorded an aggregate non cash impairment charge of $2.6 billion ($2.6 billion after tax) during the second quarter of 2009. The non cash impairment charge was recorded in goodwill and intangible asset impairments in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations for the quarter ended March 27, 2009. Also, during the second quarter of 2009, the Companys estimates of future cash flows used in determining the fair value of its Safety Products segment Sensormatic tradename as well as certain 36 Table of Contents ADT Worldwide segment franchise rights were revised downward relative to the estimates used in the Companys tests during the fourth quarter of 2008. The results of the impairment test indicated that the Safety Products Sensormatic tradename and ADT Worldwide franchise rights estimated fair values were less than their respective carrying amounts. As a result, the Company recorded an aggregate non cash impairment charge of $64 million ($40 million after tax) during the second quarter of 2009. The non cash impairment charge was recorded in goodwill and intangible asset impairments in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations for the quarter ended March 27, 2009. Operating Results Net revenue, operating (loss) income and net (loss) income for the years ended September 25, 2009, September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007 were as follows ($ in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Revenue from product sales $ 10,482 $ 13,064 $ 11,816 Service revenue 6,755 7,135 6,661 Net revenue $ 17,237 $ 20,199 $ 18,477 Operating (loss) income $ (1,487 ) $ 1,941 $ (1,732 ) Interest income 44 110 104 Interest expense (301 ) (396 ) (313 ) Other expense, net (7 ) (224 ) (255 ) (Loss) income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest (1,751 ) 1,431 (2,196 ) Income tax expense (78 ) (335 ) (324 ) Minority interest (4 ) (1 ) (4 ) (Loss) income from continuing operations (1,833 ) 1,095 (2,524 ) Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes 35 458 782 Net (loss) income $ (1,798 ) $ 1,553 $ (1,742 ) Net revenue decreased $3.0 billion, or 14.7%, for 2009 as compared to 2008, in large part due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which negatively affected 2009 by $1.5 billion. The remaining decrease in revenue was driven primarily by lower volume of steel products in our Electrical and Metal Products segment and weakness in the commercial markets, including the retailer end market, which negatively impacted our ADT Worldwide and Safety Products segments. Revenues were positively affected by $110 million for acquisitions and divestitures, primarily in our ADT Worldwide segment. 37  Table of Contents Operating income decreased $3.4 billion to an operating loss of $1.5 billion for 2009. The operating loss included an aggregate goodwill impairment charge of $2.6 billion relating to reporting units in our Electrical and Metal Products, ADT Worldwide, Fire Protection Services and Safety Products segments and intangible asset impairment charges of $64 million relating to assets at our ADT Worldwide and Safety Products segments for 2009. Additionally, lower volumes primarily in our Electrical and Metal Products and Safety Products segments negatively impacted operating income. In addition, 2009 included legacy legal settlement charges of $125 million as well as restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net of $251 million. Operating income for 2008 included Separation related costs of $4 million, restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net of $247 million and a legacy settlement charge of $29 million, offset by a credit of $10 million for class action settlement recoveries. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected operating income by $61 million for 2009. Results by Geographic Area Net revenue by geographic area for the years ended September 25, 2009, September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007 was as follows ($ in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Net revenue(1): United States $ 8,304 $ 9,465 $ 8,910 Other Americas 1,520 1,733 1,419 Europe, Middle East and Africa 4,706 5,749 5,338 Asia Pacific 2,707 3,252 2,810 $ 17,237 $ 20,199 $ 18,477 (1)Revenue is attributed to individual countries based on the reporting entity that records the transaction. Segment Results The segment discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in results for each of our segments included in continuing operations. ADT Worldwide Net revenue, goodwill and intangible asset impairments, operating income and operating margin for ADT Worldwide for the years ended September 25, 2009, September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007 were as follows ($ in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Revenue from product sales $ 2,226 $ 2,668 $ 2,542 Service revenue 4,789 5,063 4,746 Net revenue $ 7,015 $ 7,731 $ 7,288 Goodwill and intangible asset impairments $ 635 $ 1 $ 52 Operating income 233 906 817 Operating margin (1) 11.7 % 11.2 % (1)Certain operating margins have not been presented as management believes such calculations are not meaningful. 38 Table of Contents Net revenue by geographic area for ADT Worldwide for the years ended September 25, 2009, September 26, 2008, September 28, 2007 was as follows ($ in millions): 2009 2008 2007 North America $ 4,170 $ 4,218 $ 4,094 Europe, Middle East and Africa 1,834 2,355 2,214 Rest of World 1,011 1,158 980 $ 7,015 $ 7,731 $ 7,288 Net revenue for ADT Worldwide decreased $716 million, or 9.3%, during 2009 as compared to 2008. This decrease was primarily driven by the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $590 million. Revenue was positively affected by $152 million for the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Revenue from product sales decreased 16.6% and service revenue decreased 5.4%. Revenue from product sales includes sales and installation of electronic security and other systems. Service revenue is comprised of electronic security services and maintenance, including the monitoring of burglar alarms, fire alarms and other life safety systems as well as services related to retailer anti theft systems. Approximately 55% of ADTs total net revenue is contractual and is considered recurring revenue. Recurring revenue declined 3.6% during 2009 primarily as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which unfavorably impacted recurring revenue by 7.5% offset by growth in North America and Asia. Systems installation and service revenue declined 15.3% partially due to a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which unfavorably impacted system installation and service revenue by 8.3%, and lower sales volume due to continued weakness in the commercial markets, including the retailer end market. Geographically, revenue in North America decreased $48 million, or 1.1%, resulting from reduced spending primarily in the commercial markets, including the retailer end market. Revenue in EMEA decreased $521 million, or 22.1%, largely as a result of foreign currency exchange rates, which had an unfavorable impact of $323 million. The remaining decrease in EMEA was primarily a result of a decline in systems installation and service revenue due to a slowdown in the commercial markets, including the retailer end market. Revenue declined $147 million, or 12.7%, in the Rest of World geographies, which was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $219 million partially offset by growth in Asia and Latin America. Attrition rates for customers in our ADT Worldwide business increased over the prior year to 13.4% on a trailing 12 month basis for 2009, as compared to 12.9% for 2008 and 12.3% in 2007. The increased attrition was primarily due to adverse market conditions in the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, South Africa, Asia and Australia. Operating income in 2009 decreased $673 million as compared to 2008. Based on the deterioration in the commercial markets, including the retailer end market discussed above, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $613 million related to its ADT EMEA reporting unit and intangible asset impairment charges of $22 million related to certain franchise rights within North America during the second quarter of 2009. The decrease is also related to the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $44 million. The decrease was further driven by the decline in sales volume as well as an increase in bad debt charges, both as a result of the weakness experienced in the commercial markets, including the retailer end market, and the current adverse global economic conditions. Additionally, advertising costs increased which adversely affected operating income. Operating income was negatively impacted by restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges of $87 million in 2009. Operating income in 2008 included restructuring charges of $94 million and expenses of $51 million primarily to convert customers from analog to digital signal transmission in North America. There were no charges related to converting customers to digital signal during 2009. The decline in operating income was partially offset by savings realized through cost containment and restructuring actions. 39 Table of Contents Net revenue for ADT Worldwide increased $443 million, or 6.1%, during 2008, with product revenue up 5.0% and service revenue up 6.7%, as compared to 2007. Approximately 50% of ADTs total net revenue is contractual and is considered recurring revenue. Overall, recurring revenue grew 7.2% during 2008 while systems installation and service revenue grew 4.9%. Geographically, North America grew 3%, resulting largely from growth in recurring revenue which was partially offset by weakness in the retailer end market. The North America net revenue increase also includes the impact of acquisitions, which contributed $53 million. The year over year net revenue increase in North America was partially offset by weakness in the retailer end market during the fourth quarter of 2008. Revenue in the EMEA region increased $141 million, or 6.4%, as a result of foreign currency exchange rates which had a favorable impact of $142 million. This increase was partially offset by a decline in systems installation and service revenue due to weakness in the retailer end market as well as commercial softness primarily in the United Kingdom. The 18.2% revenue growth in the Rest of World geographies was primarily driven by growth in both recurring revenue and contracting across all regions. The Rest of the World increase included the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $30 million. Overall, the ADT Worldwide net revenue increase included the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $204 million. The net impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and other activity positively affected revenue by $27 million. Operating margin in ADT Worldwide increased to 11.7% in 2008 from 11.2% in 2007. North America is one of the most profitable geographic areas for ADT Worldwide with 2008 and 2007 operating margin of 15.8% and 16.9%, respectively. Margins in North America were negatively impacted by $57 million of restructuring and asset impairments in 2008 compared to $6 million in 2007. Restructuring charges in 2008 include $58 million relating to the reacquisition of certain franchise rights that were deemed to be unfavorable to the Company. There were no charges related to the reacquisition of franchise rights in 2007. In addition, North America incurred $48 million and $12 million to convert customers from analog to digital signal transmissions in 2008 and 2007, respectively. North America operating margins benefited from growth in recurring revenue partially offset by declines in the retailer end market. ADT EMEA had 2008 and 2007 operating margin of 5.0% and 2.5%, respectively. EMEAs operating income included $34 million of restructuring and impairments in 2008 compared with $67 million in 2007. EMEA margins benefited from reduced costs as a result of the restructuring program, which was partially offset by volume decreases as discussed above. Operating income in 2008 increased $89 million, or 10.9%, as compared to 2007. Factors that positively impacted operating income included increased volume, particularly our higher margin recurring revenue, operational efficiencies, including those achieved from restructuring activities in Europe, lower depreciation and amortization expense and lower long lived asset impairment charges. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense occurred primarily in North America and resulted from changes to the depreciation method and estimated useful lives for pooled subscriber assets and changes to the estimated useful lives of dealer intangible assets. The reduction in depreciation and amortization expense was partially offset by increased net expenses of $51 million, which primarily related to converting customers from analog to digital signal transmissions in North America. Results for 2007 include goodwill impairment charges due to the reorganization of our management and segment reporting structure following the Separation. 40 Table of Contents Flow Control Net revenue, operating income and operating margin for Flow Control for the years ended September 25, 2009, September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007 were as follows ($ in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Revenue from product sales $ 3,580 $ 4,201 $ 3,618 Service revenue 270 217 148 Net revenue $ 3,850 $ 4,418 $ 3,766 Operating income $ 518 $ 618 $ 457 Operating margin 13.5 % 14.0 % 12.1 % Net revenue for Flow Control decreased $568 million, or 12.9%, in 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease in net revenue was primarily driven by the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $462 million. Revenue also decreased due to reduced volume in the water business and reduced project activity in the energy end market of the thermal controls business. The decrease in revenue was partially offset by an increase in the valves business primarily from the energy end market in EMEA. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures unfavorably impacted net revenue by $3 million in 2009 and favorably impacted net revenue by $16 million in 2008. Operating income decreased $100 million, or 16.2%, in 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $73 million as well as decreased volume in the water businesses discussed above offset by margin improvements in the valves business. Margins were also negatively impacted by restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges of $29 million. Additionally, management estimates that $5 million of additional charges resulting from restructuring actions were incurred during 2009. Restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges were $8 million in 2008. Additionally, selling, general and administrative expenses in 2008 included an environmental remediation charge of $6 million related to the closure of a facility in North America. The decline in operating income was partially offset by savings realized through cost containment and restructuring actions. Net revenue for Flow Control increased $652 million, or 17.3%, in 2008 as compared to 2007. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by volume growth from continued strength in the valves and thermal businesses, and to a lesser extent, the water business. The increase in the valves business was primarily driven by project growth in the oil and gas industry while the thermal business benefited primarily from strong project growth coupled with increased selling prices. While revenue within the water business increased year over year, project activity declined during the second half of 2008, primarily in Australia. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted revenue by $314 million. The net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other activity positively affected revenue by $6 million. Operating income increased $161 million, or 35.2%, in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily from revenue growth, as well as volume efficiencies. Flow Control incurred restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net of $8 million, compared to $28 million in 2007. Additionally, selling, general and administrative expenses in 2008 included an environmental remediation charge of $6 million related to the closure of a facility in North America as compared to no charges in 2007. 41 Table of Contents Fire Protection Services Net revenue, goodwill and intangible asset impairments, operating income and operating margin for Fire Protection Services for the years ended September 25, 2009 September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007 were as follows ($ in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Revenue from product sales $ 1,751 $ 2,013 $ 1,982 Service revenue 1,677 1,826 1,744 Net revenue $ 3,428 $ 3,839 $ 3,726 Goodwill and intangible asset impairments $ 180 $ 9 $ Operating income 68 325 283 Operating margin (1) 8.5 % 7.6 % (1)Certain operating margins have not been presented as management believes such calculations are not meaningful. Net revenue for Fire Protection Services decreased $411 million, or 10.7%, during 2009 as compared to 2008. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $294 million. Additionally, revenue declined due to the continued weakness in the commercial market and current adverse global economic conditions. Revenue from product sales includes sales and installation of fire protection and other systems. Service revenue consists of inspection, maintenance, service and monitoring of fire detection and suppression systems. Geographically, revenue in our international fire businesses decreased by $294 million largely due to the impact of unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates discussed above as well as the continued weakness in the European commercial markets. Additionally, revenue in our North America SimplexGrinnell business decreased by $116 million primarily due to a decline in systems installation and upgrade activity in the sprinkler business. Operating income decreased $257 million during 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease was primarily due to a $180 million goodwill impairment in EMEA recorded during 2009 compared to a $9 million goodwill impairment in Latin America recorded during 2008. The decrease was further driven by the decline in sales volume discussed above as well as an increase in bad debt charges, both as a result of the weakness experienced in the commercial markets and the current adverse global economic conditions. There were restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges of $45 million in 2009 as compared to $25 million in 2008. Additionally, operating income decreased due to the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $9 million. The decline in operating income was partially offset by savings realized through cost containment and restructuring actions. Net revenue for Fire Protection Services increased $113 million, or 3.0%, during 2008 as compared to 2007, driven by increases in both product sales and service revenues. This increase in product sales was aided by foreign currency exchange rates, which had a favorable impact of $74 million. The increase in service revenue related to growth in service work and sprinkler contracting in North America and Asia primarily as a result of an increase in demand from the education and healthcare industries in North America and commercial expansion in the Asia region. Additionally, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact of $60 million on service revenue. The increase was partially offset by reduced revenue in EMEA and Australia/New Zealand primarily due to a decline in contracting revenue as a result of a strategic initiative to be more selective in our pursuit of contracts. Additionally, the net revenue increase was partially offset due to the planned exit of low performing non core activities in Latin America and Asia. Overall, the Fire Protection Services net revenue increase included the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $134 million. 42 Table of Contents Operating income increased $42 million, or 14.8%, during 2008 as compared to 2007 resulting largely from increased volume and improved margins, primarily in North America, and to a lesser extent, Asia and EMEA. The increase in operating income during 2008 was partially offset by $25 million of restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges. Also, operating income was unfavorably impacted by $9 million due to a goodwill impairment in the Latin America reporting unit. Electrical and Metal Products Net revenue, goodwill and intangible asset impairments, operating income and operating margin for Electrical and Metal Products for the years ended September 25, 2009, September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007 were as follows ($ in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Revenue from product sales $ 1,389 $ 2,266 $ 1,970 Service revenue 3 6 4 Net revenue $ 1,392 $ 2,272 $ 1,974 Goodwill and intangible asset impairments $ 935 $ $ Operating (loss) income (940 ) 342 159 Operating margin (1) 15.1 % 8.1 % (1)Certain operating margins have not been presented as management believes such calculations are not meaningful. Net revenue for Electrical and Metal Products decreased $880 million, or 38.7%, in 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to lower volume and selling prices of steel products largely resulting from a decline in the commercial market in North America. Lower volume and selling prices for armored cable products also contributed to the decline. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of $52 million. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures negatively affected revenue by approximately $31 million. Operating income decreased $1.3 billion in 2009 as compared to 2008. Based on the sales volume decrease as well as the significant decline in the price of steel, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $935 million during the second quarter of 2009. There was no goodwill impairment recorded during 2008. The decrease in operating income also related to volume declines as well as lower spreads for steel products. Spreads for steel products continued to decline as a direct result of higher raw material costs and lower selling prices. Lower restructuring and divestiture charges incurred in 2009 as compared to similar charges incurred in 2008 partially offset the decline in operating income discussed above. Results for 2009 included restructuring and divestiture charges of $21 million as compared to $43 million for 2008. Additionally, management estimates that $1 million of additional charges resulting from restructuring actions were incurred during 2009. Net revenue for Electrical and Metal Products increased $298 million, or 15.1%, in 2008 as compared to 2007. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by selling price increases for steel tubular products and to a lesser extent armored cable products partially offset by decreased sales volume for both products. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact of $44 million. Operating income increased $183 million, or 115.1%, in 2008 as compared to 2007. The increase in operating income was primarily due to favorable spreads on both steel tubular and armored cable products. Income generated by higher selling prices for both steel tubular and armored cable products were partially offset by decreased sales volume for both products. Operational excellence initiatives resulted in reductions in production cost rates for both steel tubular and armored cable products. The increase in operating income during 2008 was partially offset by $43 million of restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, as compared to $7 million in 2007. 43  Table of Contents Safety Products Net revenue, goodwill and intangible asset impairments, operating income and operating margin for Safety Products for the years ended September 25, 2009, September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007 were as follows ($ in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Revenue from product sales $ 1,536 $ 1,916 $ 1,704 Service revenue 16 18 15 Net revenue $ 1,552 $ 1,934 $ 1,719 Goodwill and intangible asset impairments $ 955 $ $ 7 Operating (loss) income (789 ) 284 274 Operating margin (1) 14.7 % 15.9 % (1)Certain operating margins have not been presented as management believes such calculations are not meaningful. Net revenue for Safety Products decreased $382 million, or 19.8%, during 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease is primarily related to reduced volume in our fire suppression business, life safety and electronic security businesses, which continued to be impacted by the soft economic conditions. The remaining decrease is related to the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $122 million. The decrease in our fire suppression business was primarily due to reduced spending in the commercial construction market. The decrease in the life safety business was primarily due to reduced municipal spending. The electronic security business decrease was primarily due to the slow down in the retail sector, as retail capital projects and new store openings were canceled or delayed. Operating income decreased $1.1 billion in 2009 as compared to 2008. The decline is primarily attributable to goodwill and intangible impairment charges of $955 million recorded during the quarter ended March 27, 2009 as a result of the continued slowdown in the commercial and retail markets. As discussed above, decreased sales volume within the fire suppression, life safety and electronic security businesses also negatively impacted operating income. Operating income was negatively impacted by restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges of $46 million during 2009. Additionally, management estimates that $9 million of additional charges resulting from restructuring actions were incurred during 2009. The same period in the prior year included $73 million of restructuring and asset impairment charges. Operating income also decreased by $18 million due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Operating income was also negatively impacted by a charge of $8 million relating to the amount of depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recorded had a business that was previously classified as held for sale been continuously classified as held and used (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Net revenue for Safety Products increased $215 million, or 12.5%, during 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily from strong performance in the fire suppression, and to a lesser extent electronic security and life safety businesses. The increase in the fire suppression business was driven by continued growth in the energy and marine sectors, favorable product mix and increased selling prices to offset increasing raw material costs. The increase in the life safety business was primarily driven by growth in North America as a result of increased spending by fire departments and from increased selling prices. The increase in the electronic security business was partially due to higher volume and new product introductions primarily related to casinos and schools. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $76 million also contributed to the increase in revenue. Operating income increased $10 million, or 3.6% in 2008 as compared to 2007. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to increased sales volume along with the impact of cost 44 Table of Contents savings from operational excellence initiatives. The increase in operating income during 2008 was partially offset by $73 million of restructuring, asset impairment, and divestiture charges, net as compared to $29 million in 2007. Corporate and Other Corporate expense for 2009 was $43 million higher as compared to the prior year, primarily resulting from a charge of $125 million related to the settlement of legacy securities matters, which was partially offset by $16 million benefit related to a settlement reached with a former executive. Additionally, corporate expense in 2009 included $16 million of restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges. Corporate expense for 2008 included net charges of $28 million composed of a $29 million charge for a legacy legal settlement, $4 million of separation costs and $5 million for restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net, offset by a credit of $10 million for class action settlement recoveries. The remaining decrease in corporate expense is primarily related to cost reduction initiatives and the restructuring program. Corporate expense for 2008 was $3.2 billion lower as compared to the prior year, primarily resulting from various charges in 2007, including the class action settlement charge of $2.862 billion, separation costs of $117 million and net restructuring and asset impairment charges of $40 million primarily related to the consolidation of certain headquarter functions. Corporate expense for 2008 included net charges of $28 million composed of a $29 million charge for a legacy legal settlement, $4 million of separation costs and $5 million for restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net, offset by a credit of $10 million for class action settlement recoveries. The remaining decrease in corporate expense is primarily related to cost reduction initiatives and the restructuring program. Legal Settlements In the first half of fiscal 2009, the Company settled a number of legal matters stemming from alleged violations of federal securities laws committed by former senior management, including several lawsuits from plaintiffs that had opted out of the June 2007 class action settlement, for an aggregate amount of approximately $90 million. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Companys share of this amount was approximately $24 million, with Covidien and Tyco Electronics responsible for approximately $38 million and $28 million, respectively. During the second quarter of 2009, the Company concluded that its best estimate of probable loss for its unresolved legacy securities matters was $375 million. Due to the fact that any payments ultimately made in connection with these matters would be subject to the sharing provisions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Company also recorded receivables from Covidien and Tyco Electronics in the amounts of $158 million and $116 million, respectively. As a result, the Company recorded a net charge of $101 million during the quarter ended March 27, 2009 in selling, general, and administrative expenses related to these unresolved matters. In the second half of fiscal 2009, the Company agreed to settle with all of the remaining plaintiffs that had opted out of the class action settlement as well as plaintiffs who had brought ERISA related claims for a total of $271 million. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Companys share of the settlement amount was approximately $73 million, with Covidien and Tyco Electronics responsible for approximately $114 million and $84 million, respectively. This settlement activity did not result in the Company recording a charge to its Consolidated Statements of Operations as the Company had established a reserve for its best estimate of the amount of loss during the second quarter of 2009 as discussed above. The Company continues to believe that the accrual remaining as of September 25, 2009 is its best estimate for the remaining unresolved claims. Although the Company has reserved its best estimate of probable loss, related to unresolved legacy securities claims, their 45 Table of Contents ultimate resolution could differ from the estimate and could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Interest Income and Expense Interest income was $44 million in 2009, as compared to $110 million and $104 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in interest income in 2009, and the increase in interest income in 2008, is primarily related to $47 million of interest earned on funds held in escrow prior to settlement of the class action during 2008 and lower investment yields during 2009. Interest expense was $301 million in 2009, as compared to $396 million in 2008 and $313 million in 2007. The decrease in interest expense in 2009 primarily relates to interest on the class action settlement liability of $47 million and cost related to our bridge loan of $48 million in 2008. The increase in interest expense in 2008 was a result of $47 million of interest on funds held in escrow related to the class action settlement liability, and increased costs related to our bridge loan and revolving credit facilities. The weighted average interest rate on total debt outstanding as of September 25, 2009, September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007 was 6.6%, 6.2% and 6.3%, respectively. In 2007, net interest amounts were proportionally allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics based on the debt amounts that we believe were utilized by Covidien and Tyco Electronics historically inclusive of amounts directly incurred, and is included in discontinued operations. Allocated net interest was calculated using our historical weighted average interest rate on debt, including the impact of interest rate swap agreements. The portion of Tycos interest income allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics was $35 million during 2007. The portion of Tycos interest expense allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics was $242 million during 2007. Other Expense, Net Other expense, net was $7 million in 2009 compared to $224 million in 2008 and $255 million in 2007. Other expense, net in 2009 primarily relates to a $14 million charge recorded as a result of a decrease in the receivables due from Covidien and Tyco Electronics under the Tax Sharing Agreement, which was partially offset by income of $5 million relating to a gain on derivative contracts used to economically hedge the foreign currency risk related to the Swiss franc denominated dividends. Other expense, net during 2008, includes $258 million on extinguishment of debt related to the consent solicitation and exchange offers and termination of the bridge loan facility offset by income of $6 million recorded in connection with the settlement of its 3.125% convertible senior debentures and related financial instruments. See Notes 12 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We also recorded other than temporary impairments and realized losses on the sale of investments of $6 million related primarily to investments in corporate debt. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, we recorded $40 million of income as a result of an increase in the receivables due from Covidien and Tyco Electronics under the Tax Sharing Agreement in connection with the adoption of the guidance pertaining to the accounting for uncertain income taxes. We also recorded $6 million of expense for other activity in accordance with the Tax Sharing Agreement during 2008. During 2007, other expense, net consisted primarily of a $259 million loss on early extinguishment of debt incurred in connection with debt tender offers undertaken in connection with the Separation, for which no tax benefit is available. This charge consists primarily of premiums paid and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts. The total loss on early extinguishment of debt was 46 Table of Contents $647 million, with $259 million included in continuing operations and $388 million allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics and included in discontinued operations. Income Taxes Effective Income Tax Rate The effective income tax rate for 2009 is not meaningful primarily as a result of the loss driven by the goodwill impairment charges of $2.6 billion, for which almost no tax benefit is available. Our effective income tax rate was 23.4% for 2008. Income taxes during 2008 were positively impacted by increased profitability in lower tax rate jurisdictions and release of deferred tax valuation allowances partially offset by enacted tax law changes that negatively impacted the non U.S. deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate for 2007 is not meaningful primarily as a result of the class action settlement charge, net of $2.862 billion and the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $259 million for which no tax benefit is available. Additionally, taxes for 2007 were negatively impacted by tax costs related to the Separation and were favorably impacted by the release of a deferred tax valuation allowance related to non U.S. tax rulings received during the period and reduced reserve requirements on certain legacy tax matters. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $791 million and $742 million as of September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. The valuation allowance was calculated and recorded when we determined that it was more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets would not be realized. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as payment is not expected within one year. Other Income Tax Matters In connection with the spin offs of Covidien and Tyco Electronics from Tyco, Tyco entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that governs the rights and obligations of each party with respect to certain pre Separation income tax liabilities. More specifically, Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics share 27%, 42% and 31%, respectively, of shared income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to Tycos, Covidiens and Tyco Electronics U.S. and certain non U.S. income tax returns. All costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are shared equally among the parties. Consistent with the sharing provisions of the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco had a net receivable from Covidien and Tyco Electronics of $98 million and $126 million as of September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008, respectively. In addition, as of both September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008, Tyco had a recorded liability of $554 million representing the fair value of Tycos obligations under the Tax Sharing Agreement. Tyco and its subsidiaries income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and 47 Table of Contents proposed tax adjustments. The Company is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest have been assessed as uncertain income tax positions and recorded as appropriate. For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos income taxes, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Divestitures We have continued to assess the strategic fit of our various businesses and we will pursue divestiture of businesses that do not align with our long term strategy. Held for Sale and Reflected as Continuing Operations During the fourth quarter of 2009, we approved a plan to sell a business in our ADT Worldwide segment. This business has been classified as held for sale; however, its results of operations are presented in continuing operations as the criteria for discontinued operations have not been met. We have assessed and determined that the carrying value of this business is recoverable and will continue to assess recoverability based on current fair value, less cost to sell, until the business is sold. Fair value used for the impairment assessment was based on existing market conditions. We expect to complete the sale during fiscal 2010. During the third quarter of 2008, we approved a plan to sell a business in the Safety Products segment. This business had been classified as held for sale in our historical Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the second quarter of 2009, due to a change in strategy by management, we decided not to sell the business. As a result, the business no longer satisfied the requirements to be classified as held for sale in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 27, 2009. Accordingly, the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 26, 2008 was recast to reclassify the business from held for sale to held and used. We measured the business at the lower of its (i) carrying amount before it was classified as held for sale, adjusted for depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recognized had the business been continuously classified as held and used, or (ii) fair value at the date the decision not to sell was made. We recorded a charge of $8 million in the second quarter of 2009 relating to the amount of depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recorded had the asset been continuously classified as held and used. Discontinued Operations As previously reported in our periodic filings, in July 2008, we substantially completed the sale of our Infrastructure Services business, which met the criteria to be presented as discontinued operations. In order to complete the sale of Earth Tech Brasil Ltda. ("ET Brasil") and Earth Tech UK businesses and certain assets in China, we were required to obtain consents and approvals to transfer the legal ownership of the business and assets. On January 22, 2009, we received the necessary consents and approvals to transfer the legal ownership of our ET Brasil business to Carioca Christiani Nielsen Engenharia S.A. and received cash proceeds of $13 million. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we sold our Earth Tech UK business and received net cash proceeds of $53 million. However, the gain was deferred until receipt of the necessary consents and approvals. On May 12, 2009, we received the necessary consents and approvals to transfer the legal ownership of our Earth Tech UK business to AECOM Technologies Corporation ("AECOM") and realized the deferred gain in our Consolidated Statements of Operations during the third quarter of 2009. Furthermore, on February 27, 2009, we received the necessary consents to transfer certain of the China assets and received cash proceeds of $18 million. On May 8, 2009, we received the necessary consents to transfer additional China assets and received cash proceeds of $6 million. On July 2, 2009 we received the necessary consents and approvals 48 Table of Contents to transfer the remaining assets in China and received cash proceeds of $24 million. As a result of the fiscal 2009 dispositions, a net pre tax gain of $33 million was recorded in income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended September 25, 2009. During 2008, we sold our Empresa de Transmissao de Energia do Oeste Ltda. ("ETEO") business, Ancon Building Products ("Ancon") business, Nippon Dry Chemical Co., Ltd. ("NDC") business, and a European manufacturer of public address products and acoustic systems. As discussed above, we substantially completed the sale of our Infrastructure Services Business, during the fourth quarter of 2008. These businesses met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and have been included in discontinued operations in all periods presented. In May 2008, we sold 100% of the stock of ETEO, a Brazilian subsidiary of our Infrastructure Services business for $338 million of net cash proceeds and recorded a pre tax gain of $232 million, including the effects of the economic hedge of the purchase price discussed below. The gain was recorded in income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended September 26, 2008. ETEO was part of our Corporate and Other segment. During September 2007, we entered into an economic hedge of the Brazilian Real denominated contractual sale price of the ETEO business. Since the hedging transaction was directly linked to the proceeds from the sale of a business that was reflected in discontinued operations, we began including the impact of the hedge in discontinued operations during the first quarter of 2008. During the third quarter of 2008, we incurred a pre tax loss of $36 million on this hedge. The impact of the hedge in 2007 was not material. Additionally in fiscal year 2008, we settled a contract dispute arising under our former Infrastructure Services business. In connection with the settlement, we assessed our assets under the original contract and concluded the assets were no longer recoverable, resulting in a $51 million charge to discontinued operations. During April 2008, we sold Ancon, a manufacturer of stainless steel products used in masonry construction. Ancon was part of our Corporate and Other segment. The sale was completed for $164 million in net cash proceeds and a pre tax gain of $100 million was recorded which was largely exempt from tax. The gain was recorded in income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended September 26, 2008. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we received an additional $6 million of proceeds related to the sale of Ancon. During February 2008, we sold NDC, a company in the Japanese fire protection industry. NDC was part of our Fire Protection Services and Safety Products segments. The sale was completed for $50 million in net cash proceeds and a pre tax gain of $7 million was recorded. The gain was recorded in income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended September 26, 2008. During January 2008, we sold a European manufacturer of public address products and acoustic systems, which was part of our Fire Protection Services segment and recorded an $8 million pre tax loss on sale. The loss was recorded in income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the first quarter of 2007, Aquas Industriales de Jose, C.A. ("AIJ"), a joint venture that was majority owned by Infrastructure Services, was sold for $42 million in net cash proceeds and a pre tax gain of $19 million was recorded. The gain was recorded in discontinued operations, net of income taxes in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. AIJ was part of our Corporate and Other segment. 49 Table of Contents During the third quarter of 2007, we completed the Separation and have presented our Healthcare and Electronics businesses as discontinued operations in all periods presented. In each period prior to the Separation, net interest and loss on early extinguishment of debt, which is included in other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, amounts were proportionally allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics based on the debt amounts that we believe were utilized by Covidien and Tyco Electronics historically inclusive of amounts directly incurred. Allocated net interest was calculated using our historical weighted average interest rate on debt including the impact of interest rate swap agreements. These allocated amounts were included in discontinued operations. During 2007, allocated interest income, interest expense and other expense, net was $35 million, $242 million and $388 million, respectively. During 2007, we incurred pre tax separation costs related primarily to professional services and employee related costs of $154 million and $289 million, respectively, in discontinued operations. Additionally, the year ended September 28, 2007 includes tax charges related to the Separation primarily for the write off of deferred tax assets that are no longer realizable of $88 million in discontinued operations. We have used available information to develop our best estimates for certain assets and liabilities related to the Separation. In limited instances, final determination of the balances will be made in subsequent periods. During the year ended September 28, 2007, $72 million was recorded through shareholders equity, primarily related to a cash true up adjustment of $57 million and $15 million of other items. During the year ended September 26, 2008, $70 million of other items were recorded through shareholders equity. During the year ended September 25, 2009, $43 million was recorded through shareholders equity, $9 million of which related to a pre Separation income tax filing in a non U.S. jurisdiction and $34 million of other items. The other items discussed above, which aggregate $119 million, reflect immaterial adjustments to shareholders equity which were recorded to correct the distribution amount at the date of Separation. Adjustments in the future for the impact of filing final income tax returns in certain jurisdictions where those returns include a combination of our, Covidien and or Tyco Electronics legal entities and for certain amended income tax returns for the periods prior to the Separation may be recorded to either shareholders equity or the Consolidated Statements of Operations depending on the specific item giving rise to the adjustment. Acquisitions During the year ended September 25, 2009, cash paid for acquisitions totaled $50 million, which primarily related to the acquisition of Vue Technology, Inc., a provider of radio frequency identification ("RFID") technology, by our Safety Products segment. During the year ended September 26, 2008, cash paid for acquisitions totaled $401 million, which primarily related to the acquisition of Winner Security Services LLC ("Winner"), Sensormatic Security Corp. ("SSC") and First Service Security ("FirstService"). During 2007, cash paid for acquisitions totaled $31 million, primarily within our ADT Worldwide, Safety Products and Flow Control segments. These acquisitions were funded utilizing cash from operations. The results of operations of the acquired companies have been included in Tycos consolidated results from the respective acquisition dates. These acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For a detailed discussion of acquisitions, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 50  Table of Contents  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. Depreciation and Amortization Methods for Security Monitoring Related Assets Tyco generally considers assets related to the acquisition of new customers in its electronic security business in three asset categories: internally generated residential subscriber systems, internally generated commercial subscriber systems (collectively referred to as subscriber system assets) and customer accounts acquired through the ADT dealer program (referred to as dealer intangibles). Subscriber system assets include installed property, plant and equipment for which Tyco retains ownership and deferred costs directly related to the customer acquisition and system installation. Subscriber system assets and any deferred revenue resulting from the customer acquisition are accounted for over the expected life of the subscriber. In certain geographical areas where the Company has a large number of customers that behave in a similar manner over time, the Company accounts for subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue using pools, with separate pools for the components of subscriber system assets and any related deferred revenue based on the month and year of acquisition. Effective as of the beginning of the third quarter of 2007, Tyco changed the depreciation method and estimated useful life used to account for pooled subscriber system assets (primarily in North America) and related deferred revenue from the straight line method with lives ranging from 10 to 14 years to an accelerated method with lives up to 15 years. The accelerated method utilizes declining balance rates based on geographical area ranging from 160% to 195% for residential subscriber pools and 145% to 265% for commercial subscriber pools and converts to a straight line methodology when the resulting depreciation charge is greater than that from the accelerated method. The Company will continue to use a straight line method with a 14 year life for non pooled subscriber system assets (primarily in Europe and Asia) and related deferred revenue, with remaining balances written off upon customer termination. The change in the method and estimated useful life used to account for pooled subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue resulted from our ongoing analysis of all pertinent factors, including actual customer attrition data specific to customer categories and geographical areas, demand, competition, and the estimated technological life of the installed systems. The pertinent factors have been influenced by managements ongoing customer retention programs, as well as tactical and strategic initiatives to improve service delivery, customer satisfaction, and the credit worthiness of the subscriber customer base. All pertinent factors, including actual customer attrition data specific to customer categories and geographical areas, demand, competition, and the estimated technological life of the installed systems, will continue to be reviewed by the Company at each balance sheet date to assess the continued appropriateness of methods and estimated useful lives. Effective as of the beginning of the third quarter of 2007, Tyco also changed the estimated useful life of dealer intangibles in geographical areas comprising approximately 90% of the net carrying value of dealer intangibles from 12 to 15 years. The Company continues to amortize dealer intangible assets on an accelerated basis. The change in the estimated useful life used to account for dealer intangibles resulted from our ongoing analysis of all pertinent factors, including actual customer attrition data, demand, competition, and the estimated technological life of the installed systems. The pertinent factors have been influenced by managements ongoing customer retention programs, as well as tactical and strategic initiatives to improve service delivery, customer satisfaction, and the credit worthiness of the subscriber customer base. Attrition rates for customers in our ADT Worldwide business were 13.4%, 12.9% and 12.3% on a trailing 12 month basis for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 51 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Contract sales for the installation of fire protection systems, large security intruder systems and other construction related projects are recorded primarily under the percentage of completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related total cost of the project at completion. The risk of this methodology is its dependence upon estimates of costs at completion, which are subject to the uncertainties inherent in long term contracts. Revisions to cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits each period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they become determinable. If estimates are inaccurate, there is risk that our revenue and profits for the period may be overstated or understated. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience and trend analysis. Loss Contingencies Accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings, self insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on judgment, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates. Additionally, the Company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. Income Taxes In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future pre tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense recorded in the future may be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction. Any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance could result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not currently aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately 52 Table of Contents proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Asset Impairments Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually and more frequently if triggering events occur. In performing these assessments, management relies on various factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable transactions and other market data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors which require judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment. Since judgment is involved in performing fair value measurements used in goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets impairment analyses, there is risk that the carrying values of our goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets may be overstated. We elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for all goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. In the first step of the goodwill impairment test, the Company compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. Fair value for the goodwill impairment test is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the Companys future budgets discounted using the market participants weighted average cost of capital and market indicators of terminal year cash flows. Other valuation methods are used to corroborate the discounted cash flow method. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered potentially impaired and further tests are performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. In the second step of the goodwill impairment test, the Company compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. The Company allocates the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill. Long Lived Assets Assets held and used by the Company, including property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. Tyco performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if impairment exists. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, Tyco groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identified. If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Impairments to long lived assets to be disposed of are recorded based upon the fair value less cost to sell of the applicable assets. The calculation of the fair value of long lived assets is based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of long lived assets, there is a risk that the carrying value of our long lived assets may be overstated or understated. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations. Two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions. The discount rate represents the market rate for high quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of 53 Table of Contents pension benefit obligations. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our present value of pension obligations by approximately $77 million. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected long term rates of return on those types of plan assets, in determining the expected long term return on plan assets. A 50 basis point decrease in the expected long term return on plan assets would increase our pension expense by approximately $7 million. For fiscal 2010, we expect that recent declines in interest rates will increase our pension expense, but is not expected to materially increase required contributions.  Liquidity and Capital Resources On September 30, 2009, Tyco International Finance S.A. ("TIFSA") issued $500 million aggregate principle amount of 4.125% notes due 2014 (the "2014 notes"), which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. TIFSA received net proceeds of approximately $496 million after underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses. On January 9, 2009, TIFSA issued $750 million aggregate principle amount of 8.5% notes due on January 15, 2019, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company (the "2019 notes"). Additionally, the holders of the 2019 notes have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the 2019 Notes on July 15, 2014 at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes tendered, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Otherwise, the 2019 notes mature on January 15, 2019. TIFSA received net proceeds of approximately $745 million after underwriting discounts and offering expenses. The net proceeds of the aforementioned offerings may be used for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment of indebtedness, acquisitions, additions to working capital, repurchase of common shares, capital expenditures and investments in the Companys subsidiaries. In January 2009, TIFSA made a payment of $215 million to extinguish all of its 6.125% notes due 2009. Additionally, in November 2008, TIFSA made a payment of $300 million to extinguish all of its 6.125% notes due 2008. Additionally, in January 2009, we repaid the entire outstanding balance of $686 million on our revolving credit facilities. As of September 25, 2009, there were no amounts drawn under our revolving credit facilities. As of September 25, 2009, the aggregate available commitment under our senior revolving credit facilities was $1.69 billion, $200 million of which was dedicated to backstop all of our commercial paper outstanding as of such date. We continually monitor developments regarding the availability of funds under our revolving credit facilities. Although there is some risk that financial institutions will fail to perform their contractual obligations, particularly in times of credit market distress, we believe that the lenders under our revolving credit facilities are capable of meeting any borrowing requests we may make for the foreseeable future. As discussed above, as of September 25, 2009, we had $200 million of commercial paper outstanding. We continue to experience increased availability within the commercial paper markets. Our multi year revolving credit facilities serve as a backstop to our commercial paper program. In addition to our available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of potential liquidity include committed credit lines, our commercial paper program, public debt and equity markets as well as the ability to sell trade accounts receivable. We continue to balance our operating, investing and financing uses of cash through investment in our existing core businesses, strategic acquisitions and divestitures, dividends and share repurchases. We believe our cash position, amounts available under our credit facilities and cash provided by operating activities will be adequate to cover our operational and business needs. As a result of recent declines in interest rates during 2009, pension costs may increase in fiscal 2010. We will continue to monitor market conditions and assess the impact, if any, on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Approximately 100% of our U.S. and more than 95% of our non U.S. funded pension plans are invested in marketable investments, including publicly traded 54 Table of Contents equity and fixed income securities. Although we do not believe we will be required to make materially higher cash contributions in the next 12 months, if market conditions worsen, we may be required to make incremental cash contributions under local statutory law. The sources of our cash flow from operating activities and the use of a portion of that cash in our operations for the years ended September 25, 2009, September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007 were as follows ($ in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Cash flows from operating activities: Operating (loss) income $ (1,487 ) $ 1,941 $ (1,732 ) Goodwill and intangible asset impairments 2,705 10 59 Non cash restructuring and asset impairment charges, net 23 36 11 Losses on divestitures 13 4 Depreciation and amortization(1) 1,133 1,154 1,148 Non cash compensation expense 103 99 173 Deferred income taxes (83 ) (94 ) (16 ) Provision for losses on accounts receivable and inventory 156 135 94 (Gain) loss on the retirement of debt (2 ) 258 259 Other, net 61 (124 ) (231 ) Class action settlement liability (3,020 ) 2,992 Net change in working capital 142 (646 ) (414 ) Interest income 44 110 104 Interest expense (301 ) (396 ) (313 ) Income tax expense (78 ) (335 ) (324 ) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 2,429 $ (872 ) $ 1,814 Other cash flow items: Capital expenditures, net(2) $ (696 ) $ (706 ) $ (643 ) Decrease in sale of accounts receivable 10 14 7 Accounts purchased from ADT dealer program (543 ) (376 ) (409 ) Purchase accounting and holdback liabilities (2 ) (2 ) (10 ) Voluntary pension contributions 22 4 23 (1)Includes depreciation expense of $617 million, $626 million and $635 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and amortization of intangible assets of $516 million, $528 million and $513 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. (2)Includes net proceeds of $13 million, $28 million and $23 million received for the sale/disposition of property, plant and equipment in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The net change in working capital increased operating cash flow by $142 million in 2009. The components of this change are set forth in detail in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The significant changes in working capital included a $367 million decrease in inventory, a $207 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $106 million decrease in contracts in progress, offset by a $352 million decrease in accounts payable and a $148 million decrease in income taxes, net. During 2009, we completed the sale of all of our remaining Infrastructure Services businesses for net cash proceeds of $66 million. We continue to fund capital expenditures to grow our business, improve the cost structure of our businesses, to invest in new processes and technology, and to maintain high quality production standards. The level of capital expenditures in 2010 is expected to exceed spending levels in 2009 and is also expected to exceed depreciation. 55 Table of Contents During 2009, 2008 and 2007 we paid out $154 million, $187 million and $70 million, respectively, in cash related to restructuring activities. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our restructuring activities. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, related to continuing operations was $291 million, $501 million, and $649 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, Tyco paid $543 million, $376 million and $409 million of cash, respectively, to acquire approximately 512,000, 370,000 and 415,000 customer contracts for electronic security services through the ADT dealer program. As previously discussed, effective June 29, 2007, we completed the Separation. In connection with the Separation, we paid $68 million and $349 million in Separation costs during 2008 and 2007 respectively. Of these amounts, $36 million and $256 million were included in cash flows from discontinued operating activities, respectively. During the second quarter of 2008, Tyco released $2,960 million of funds placed in escrow during the third quarter of 2007 as well as $60 million of interest earned on those funds for the benefit of the class as stipulated in the Courts final order related to the class action settlement. We will continue to divest businesses that do not align with our overall strategy. We expect to use the proceeds from these sales, as well as the cash generated by our operations, to continue to make investments in our businesses that are intended to grow revenue and improve productivity, including our restructuring actions. We expect to also use cash to selectively pursue acquisitions. Pursuant to our share repurchase program, we may repurchase Tyco shares from time to time in open market purchases at prevailing market prices, in negotiated transactions off the market, or pursuant to an approved 10b5 1 trading plan in accordance with applicable regulations. Management believes that cash generated by or available to us should be sufficient to fund our capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future, including quarterly dividend payments. We intend to continue to repurchase shares under our existing $1.0 billion share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors on July 10, 2008 depending on credit market conditions, macroeconomic factors and expectations regarding future cash flows. Capitalization Shareholders equity was $12.9 billion or $27.30 per share, as of September 25, 2009, compared to $15.5 billion or $32.76 per share, as of September 26, 2008. Shareholders equity decreased primarily due to a net loss of $1.8 billion, which was primarily driven by goodwill and intangible asset impairments, dividends declared of $472 million, a $220 million current period change relating to the Companys retirement plans and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $203 million. Total debt was $4.3 billion as of September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008, respectively. Total debt as a percentage of capitalization (total debt and shareholders equity) was 25% as of September 25, 2009 and 22% as of September 26, 2008, respectively. Our cash balance increased to $2.4 billion as of September 25, 2009, as compared to $1.5 billion as of September 26, 2008. This increase in cash was primarily due to cash generated by the operating segments as well as proceeds from issuance of long term debt. 56  Table of Contents Debt Tenders In connection with the settlement of litigation arising from the Separation related to our public debt, on June 3, 2008 we, along with our finance subsidiary TIFSA, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and successor company to Tyco International Group S.A. ("TIGSA"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company organized under the laws of Luxembourg, consummated consent solicitations and exchange offers related to certain series of debt issued under our 1998 and 2003 indentures. In connection with the exchange offers, we issued $422 million principal amount of 7.0% notes due 2019 in exchange for an equal principal amount of 7.0% notes due 2028 and $707 million principal amount of 6.875% notes due 2021 in exchange for an equal principal amount of 6.875% notes due 2029. In connection with the consent solicitations, holders of our 6.0% notes due 2013, 6.125% notes due 2008, 6.125% notes due 2009, 6.75% notes due 2011, 6.375% notes due 2011, 7.0% notes due 2028 and 6.875% notes due 2029 collectively received consent payments totaling $250 million. The terms of the consent and exchange offers were evaluated as a debt modification in accordance with the authoritative guidance for debtors accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments, and it was determined that the 7.0% notes due 2028 and the 6.875% notes due 2029 were extinguished because the cash flows of the new bonds as compared to the original bonds were substantially modified. As a result, the new bonds and the 7.0% notes due 2028 and the 6.875% notes due 2029 that were not tendered for exchange were recorded at their fair value upon completion of the exchange offers. In determining fair value, we measured the bonds as if they were an initial issuance to the public. This was done by obtaining effective yield data derived from comparable pricing received from the issuance of bonds with similar ratings and covenants by large public companies. During the year ended September 26, 2008, in connection with the consent solicitations and exchange offers, we recorded a $222 million charge to other expense, net as a loss on extinguishment of debt. This charge was comprised of the consent payments related to the extinguished bonds (notes due 2028 and 2029), premium on the exchanged bonds which represents the difference between the fair value and the book value of the extinguished bonds, and the write off of the original unamortized debt issuance costs, as well as fees paid to third parties associated with the bonds that were not deemed extinguished. The remaining portion of the consent payment and issuance costs will be amortized over the remaining life of the bonds. During the year ended September 28, 2007, we recorded a $259 million charge to other expense, net for the loss on early extinguishment of debt related to the debt tender offers in connection with the Separation. Bank and Revolving Credit Facilities On June 24, 2008, Tyco and TIFSA entered into a $500 million senior unsecured revolving credit agreement with Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent for the lenders party thereto. This credit agreement has a three year term. Borrowings under this agreement have a variable interest rate based on LIBOR or an alternate base rate. The margin over LIBOR can vary based on changes in our credit rating and facility utilization. Together with our $1.19 billion five year senior revolving credit agreement, dated as of April 25, 2007, our total committed revolving credit line was $1.69 billion as of September 25, 2009. These revolving credit facilities may be used for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes. As of September 25, 2009, there were no amounts drawn under these facilities, although we had dedicated $200 million of availability to backstop outstanding commercial paper. As discussed above, we believe that all of the lenders under our revolving credit facility are capable of meeting any borrowing requests TIFSA may make. TIFSAs bank credit agreements contain customary terms and conditions, and financial covenants that limit the ratio of our debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and that limit our ability to incur subsidiary debt or grant liens on our property. Our indentures contain 57 Table of Contents customary covenants including limits on negative pledges, subsidiary debt and sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are considered restrictive to our business. The following tables detail our long term and short term debt ratings as of September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008: Long Term Debt Ratings 2009 2008 Moodys Baa1 Baa1 Standard & Poors BBB+ BBB+ Fitch BBB+ BBB+ Short Term Debt Ratings 2009 2008 Moodys P 2 P 2 Standard & Poors A 2 A 2 Fitch F2 F2 The security ratings set forth above are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.  Commitments and Contingencies Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations and commitments for principal debt, minimum lease payment obligations under non cancelable operating leases and other obligations as of September 25, 2009 is as follows ($ in millions): 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total Debt(1) $ 227 $ 516 $ 850 $ $ 656 $ 1,913 $ 4,162 Interest payments(2) 273 255 211 184 164 801 1,888 Capital leases(3) 18 24 3 4 4 38 91 Operating leases 253 203 147 89 51 123 866 Purchase obligations(4) 90 5 3 98 Total contractual cash obligations(5)(6) $ 861 $ 1,003 $ 1,214 $ 277 $ 875 $ 2,875 $ 7,105 (1)Excludes debt discount and swap activity. (2)Interest payments consist of interest on our fixed interest rate debt and exclude the impact of our interest rate swaps. (3)Excludes interest. (4)Purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of good and services. (5)Other long term liabilities primarily consist of the following: pension and postretirement costs, income taxes, warranties and environmental liabilities and are excluded from this table. We are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type. The minimum required contributions to our pension plans are expected to be approximately $80 million in 2010 and we expect to pay $7 million in 2010 related to postretirement benefit plans. (6)As of September 25, 2009, we recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $284 million and gross interest and penalties of $50 million, both of which are classified as non current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as payment is not expected within one year. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing for such payments in future years; therefore, such amounts have been excluded from the above contractual obligation table. 58 Table of Contents As discussed above, as of September 25, 2009, we had total commitments of $1.69 billion under our revolving credit facilities, $500 million of which matures on June 24, 2011 and $1.19 billion of which matures on April 25, 2012. As of September 25, 2009, there were no amounts drawn under our revolving credit facilities. As of September 25, 2009, the aggregate available commitment under our senior revolving credit facilities was $1.69 billion, $200 million of which was dedicated to backstop all of our commercial paper outstanding as of such date. In May 2008, TIFSA commenced issuing commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes. As of September 25, 2009, TIFSA had $200 million of commercial paper outstanding which bore interest at an average rate of 0.33%. As of September 25, 2009, we classified the outstanding commercial paper balance of $200 million as short term as we intend to repay such amount during the next twelve months. As of September 26, 2008, we classified $116 million of short term commercial paper as long term as settlement of the amount outstanding was not expected to require the use of working capital in the next twelve months as we had both the intent and the ability to refinance this debt on a long term basis. As of September 25, 2009, we had total outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees of $659 million. In the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In connection with the Separation, we entered into a liability sharing agreement regarding certain actions that were pending against Tyco prior to the Separation. Under the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, we have assumed 27%, Covidien has assumed 42% and Tyco Electronics has assumed 31% of certain Tyco pre Separation contingent and other corporate liabilities, which include certain outstanding legacy and tax contingencies and any actions with respect to the spin offs or the distributions made or brought by any third party. Any amounts relating to these contingent and other corporate liabilities paid by Tyco after the spin offs that are subject to the allocation provisions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement or Tax Sharing Agreement will be shared among Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics pursuant to the same allocation ratio. Legal Matters Class Action and Legacy Securities Matters For a discussion of contingencies related to Tycos legacy securities litigation and various legal matters, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Class Action Settlement and Legacy Securities Matters. Adverse outcomes in certain actions to which we are a party could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Environmental Matters Tyco is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos environmental matters, see Item 1. Business Environmental Matters and Item 3. Legal Proceedings Environmental Matters. Asbestos Matters Tyco and certain of its subsidiaries are named as defendants in bodily injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials. For a detailed discussion of Tycos contingencies related to asbestos related matters, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 59 Table of Contents Income Taxes Tyco and its subsidiaries income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. The Company is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest have been assessed as uncertain income tax positions and recorded as appropriate. For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos income taxes, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Compliance Matters Tyco has received and responded to various allegations and other information that improper activities were conducted by Tyco employees in recent years, in particular with respect to DOJ and SEC investigations that have resulted in our performing a Company wide baseline review of our policies, controls and practices as they relate to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. For a detailed discussion of these contingencies and others related to Tycos compliance efforts, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Compliance Matters. Other Matters The Company is a defendant in a number of other pending legal proceedings incidental to present and former operations, acquisitions and dispositions. The Company does not expect the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Backlog As of September 25, 2009, we had a backlog of unfilled orders of $9.0 billion, compared to a backlog of $9.6 billion as of September 26, 2008. We expect that approximately 86% of our backlog as of September 25, 2009 will be filled during 2010. Backlog by segment as of September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008 is as follows ($ in millions): 2009 2008 ADT Worldwide $ 5,908 $ 5,917 Flow Control 1,698 2,083 Fire Protection Services 1,169 1,314 Electrical and Metal Products 72 117 Safety Products 114 154 $ 8,961 $ 9,585 Backlog decreased by $624 million, or 6.5%, from $9.6 billion as of September 26, 2008 to $9.0 billion as of September 25, 2009. Unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a decrease of $87 million. ADT Worldwides backlog decreased by $9 million, or 0.2%, as of September 25, 2009. The decrease was primarily due to unfavorable exchange rates of $83 million partially offset by an increase in net bookings of $74 million. ADT Worldwides total account base grew 2.9% during 2009 to 7.4 million accounts. The amount of recurring revenue in force as of September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008 was $4.0 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. The increase in recurring revenue in force was primarily the result of the increase in the account base discussed above partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Recurring revenue in force represents 12 months fees for monitoring and maintenance services under contract in the security business. Flow Controls backlog decreased by $385 million primarily due to decreased bookings of $398 million offset by favorable exchange rates of $13 million. Fire Protection Services 60 Table of Contents backlog decreased by $145 million primarily due to unfavorable exchange rates of $15 million and decreased bookings of $130 million.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale of Accounts Receivable Certain of Tycos international businesses utilize the sale of accounts receivable as short term financing mechanisms. The aggregate amount outstanding under the Companys remaining international accounts receivable programs was $55 million, $65 million and $76 million as of September 25, 2009, September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007, respectively. Guarantees Certain of our business segments have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from 2009 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would typically be triggered in the event of nonperformance and performance under the guarantees, if required, would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. There are certain guarantees or indemnifications extended among Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics in accordance with the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Tax Sharing Agreement. The guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the Tax Sharing Agreement. At the time of the Separation, we recorded a liability necessary to recognize the fair value of such guarantees and indemnifications. In the absence of observable transactions for identical or similar guarantees, we determined the fair value of these guarantees and indemnifications utilizing expected present value measurement techniques. Significant assumptions utilized to determine fair value included determining a range of potential outcomes, assigning a probability weighting to each potential outcome and estimating the anticipated timing of resolution. The probability weighted outcomes were discounted using our incremental borrowing rate. The liability necessary to reflect the fair value of the guarantees and indemnifications under the Tax Sharing Agreement is $554 million, which is included in other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008. The guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the Tax Sharing Agreement. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Tax Sharing Agreement. In addition, we historically provided support in the form of financial and or performance guarantees to various Covidien and Tyco Electronics operating entities. In connection with the Separation, we worked with the guarantee counterparties to cancel or assign these guarantees to Covidien or Tyco Electronics. To the extent these guarantees were not assigned prior to the Separation date, we assumed primary liability on any remaining such support. The estimated fair value of these obligations is $4 million and $7 million, which are included in other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008, respectively, with an offset to shareholders equity on the Separation date. In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business Environmental Matters and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these liabilities. 61 Table of Contents In the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As of September 25, 2009, we had total outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees of $659 million. We record estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. For further information on estimated product warranty, see Notes 1 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2001, a division of Safety Products initiated a Voluntary Replacement Program ("VRP") associated with the acquisition of Central Sprinkler. The VRP relates to the replacement of certain O ring seal sprinkler heads which were originally manufactured by Central Sprinkler prior to Tycos acquisition. Under this program, the sprinkler heads are being replaced free of charge to property owners. On May 1, 2007, we, along with the Consumer Products Safety Commission announced an August 31, 2007 deadline for filing claims to participate in the VRP. We will fulfill all valid claims for replacement of qualifying sprinklers received up to August 31, 2007. Settlements during 2009, 2008 and 2007 include cash expenditures of $33 million, $49 million and $38 million, respectively, related to the VRP. The Company believes the remaining liability represents our best estimate of the cost required to complete the VRP as of September 25, 2009, which is not material. 62  Table of Contents  Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued authoritative guidance which established the FASB Standards Accounting Codification ("Codification") as the source of authoritative GAAP recognized by the FASB to be applied to nongovernmental entities, and rules and interpretive releases of the SEC as authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. The Codification supersedes all the existing non SEC accounting and reporting standards upon its effective date and, subsequently, the FASB will not issue new standards in the form of Statements, FASB Staff Positions or Emerging Issues Task Force Abstracts. The guidance is not intended to change or alter existing GAAP. The guidance became effective for Tyco in the fourth quarter of 2009. The guidance did not have an impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. All references to previous numbering of FASB Statements, FASB Staff Positions or Emerging Issues Task Force Abstracts have been removed from the financial statements and accompanying footnotes. In May 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for subsequent events. The guidance provides authoritative accounting literature related to evaluating subsequent events that was previously addressed only in the auditing literature. The guidance is similar to the current guidance with some exceptions that are not intended to result in significant change to current practice. The guidance defines subsequent events and also requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date. The Company adopted the disclosure provisions of the guidance as of June 26, 2009. The adoption did not have an impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In April 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments, which amended existing guidance. The guidance requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim financial statements as well as in annual financial statements. The Company adopted the disclosure provisions of the guidance as of June 26, 2009. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the adoption of the guidance. The adoption did not have an impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In March 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities. The guidance is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entitys results of operations. The Company adopted the disclosure provisions of the guidance as of December 27, 2008. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the adoption of the guidance. The adoption did not have an impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In February 2007, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities. The guidance permits an entity, on a contract by contract basis, to make an irrevocable election to account for certain types of financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value, rather than historical cost, with changes in the fair value, whether realized or unrealized, recognized in earnings. The guidance became effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2009 at which time the Company did not elect the fair value option for eligible items. In September 2006, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for fair value measurements, which enhances existing guidance for measuring assets and liabilities at fair value. The guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which permits companies to partially defer the effective date of the guidance for one year for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. During the first quarter of 2009 the Company elected to defer the adoption of the guidance for one year for non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis which is effective for Tyco in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, on a 63 Table of Contents prospective basis. The guidance became effective for Tyco in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 for financial assets and liabilities only. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the adoption of the guidance. In September 2006, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. The guidance requires that employers recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as a net asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognize as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, net of income taxes, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. The Company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of the guidance as of September 28, 2007. The guidance also requires companies to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of their fiscal year end. The Company adopted the measurement date provisions of the guidance on September 27, 2008. As a result, Tyco measured its plan assets and benefit obligations on September 26, 2008 and adjusted its opening balances of accumulated (deficit) earnings and accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income for the change in net periodic benefit cost and fair value, respectively, from the previously used measurement date of August 31, 2008. The adoption of the measurement date provisions resulted in a net decrease to accumulated (deficit) earnings of $5 million, net of an income tax benefit of $2 million, and a net increase to accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income of $61 million, net of income taxes of $28 million for 2009. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the adoption of the guidance. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In September 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for the accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. The guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable. The selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence if available, third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available, or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific evidence nor third party evidence is available. The guidance requires arrangements under which multiple revenue generating activities to be performed be allocated at inception. The residual method under the existing accounting guidance has been eliminated. The guidance expands the disclosure requirements related to multiple deliverable revenue arrangements. The guidance becomes effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified beginning in fiscal 2011, with early adoption permitted. The guidance applies on a prospective basis unless the Company specifically elects to apply the guidance retrospectively. The Company is currently assessing what impact, if any, the guidance will have on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows, as well as the timing of its adoption of the guidance. In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which amended the existing guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities, to address the elimination of the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity. The guidance also replaces the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity, and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity. Additionally, the guidance requires any enterprise that holds a variable interest in a variable interest entity to provide enhanced disclosures that will provide users of financial statements with more transparent information about an enterprises involvement in a variable interest entity. The guidance is effective for Tyco in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. The Company is currently assessing what impact, if any, that the guidance will have on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets. The guidance requires additional disclosures about plan assets related to an employers defined benefit pension or other post retirement plans to enable investors to 64 Table of Contents better understand how investment decisions are made, the major categories of plan assets, the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets, the effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) on changes in plan assets for the period, and the significant concentrations of risk within plan assets. The disclosure provisions of the guidance are effective for Tyco in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. In June 2008, the FASB ratified authoritative guidance for determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities. The guidance addresses whether instruments granted in share based payment awards are participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, must be included in the earnings allocation in calculating earnings per share under the two class method. The guidance requires that unvested share based payment awards that contain non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents be treated as participating securities in calculating earnings per share. The guidance is effective for Tyco starting with the first quarter of fiscal 2010, and shall be applied retrospectively to all prior periods. The Company believes that the guidance will not have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In April 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for determining the useful life of intangible assets. The guidance amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset. The guidance is effective for Tyco in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The Company has determined that the guidance will not have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB revised the authoritative guidance for business combinations. The revised guidance retains the underlying concepts of the existing guidance in that business combinations are still accounted for at fair value. However, the accounting for certain other aspects of business combinations will be affected. Acquisition costs will generally be expensed as incurred. Restructuring costs associated with a business combination will generally be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date. In process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible at the acquisition date until it is completed or abandoned and its useful life can be determined. Changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions after the acquisition date will generally impact income tax expense. The revised guidance also expands required disclosures surrounding the nature and financial effects of business combinations. The revised guidance is effective, on a prospective basis, for Tyco in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. In December 2007, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements. The guidance requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest (minority interest prior to the adoption of the guidance) as equity in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest should be included in consolidated net income on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The guidance also amends certain existing consolidation procedures in order to achieve consistency with the requirements of the revised authoritative guidance for business combinations discussed above. The guidance also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest. This guidance is effective for Tyco in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The implementation of the guidance will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  Forward Looking Information Certain statements in this report are "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. All statements contained herein that are not clearly historical in nature are forward looking, and the words "anticipate," "believe," "expect," "estimate," "project" and similar expressions are generally intended to identify forward looking statements. Any forward looking statement contained herein, in press releases, written statements or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), or in Tycos communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the 65 Table of Contents normal course of business through meetings, web casts, phone calls and conference calls, regarding expectations with respect to sales, earnings, cash flows, operating efficiencies, product expansion, backlog, the consummation and benefits of acquisitions and divestitures, as well as financings and repurchases of debt or equity securities, are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and contingencies. Many of these risks, uncertainties and contingencies are beyond our control, and may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from anticipated results, performance or achievements. Factors that might affect such forward looking statements include, among other things: overall economic and business conditions; the demand for Tycos goods and services; competitive factors in the industries in which Tyco competes; changes in tax requirements (including tax rate changes, new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations); results and consequences of Tycos internal investigation and governmental investigations concerning the Companys governance, management, internal controls and operations including its business operations outside the United States; the outcome of litigation and governmental proceedings; effect of income tax audit settlements; our ability to repay or refinance our outstanding indebtedness as it matures; our ability to operate within the limitations imposed by financing arrangements and to maintain our credit ratings; interest rate fluctuations and other changes in borrowing costs; other capital market conditions, including availability of funding sources and currency exchange rate fluctuations; availability of and fluctuations in the prices of key raw materials, including steel and copper; economic and political conditions in international markets, including governmental changes and restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders; the ability to achieve cost savings in connection with the Companys strategic restructuring and Six Sigma initiatives and our ability to execute our portfolio refinement and acquisition strategies; potential further impairment of our goodwill and or our long lived assets; the impact of fluctuations in the price of Tyco common shares; risks associated with the change in our jurisdiction of incorporation from Bermuda to Switzerland, including the possibility of reduced flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management, increased or different regulatory burdens, and the possibility that we may not realize anticipated tax benefits; changes in U.S. and non U.S. governmental laws and regulations; and the possible effects on Tyco of future legislation in the United States that may limit or eliminate potential U.S. tax benefits resulting from Tycos jurisdiction of incorporation or deny U.S. government contracts to Tyco based upon its jurisdiction of incorporation.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of conducting business, we are exposed to certain risks associated with potential changes in market conditions. These risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Accordingly, we have established a comprehensive risk 66 Table of Contents management process to monitor, evaluate and manage the principal exposures we believe we are subject to. We seek to manage these risks through the use of financial derivative instruments. Our portfolio of derivative financial instruments may, from time to time, include forward foreign currency exchange contracts, foreign currency options, interest rate swaps and forward commodity contracts. Derivative financial instruments related to interest rate sensitivity of debt obligations, intercompany cross border transactions and anticipated non functional currency cash flows are used with the goal of mitigating a significant portion of these exposures when it is cost effective to do so. We do not execute transactions or utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, to reduce the risk that a counterparty will be unable to honor its contractual obligations to us, we only enter into contracts with counterparties having at least an A /A3 long term debt rating. These counterparties are generally financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one party. Foreign Currency Exposures We hedge our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates through the use of forward foreign currency exchange contracts. During 2009, our largest exposures to foreign exchange rates existed primarily with the Swiss franc, British pound, Euro, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. The market risk related to the forward foreign currency exchange contracts (excluding the dividend hedge contract discussed below) is measured by estimating the potential impact of a 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates. The rates used to perform this analysis were based on the market rates in effect on September 25, 2009. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in a $6 million net increase in the fair value of the contracts. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in a $7 million net decrease in the fair value of the contracts. However, gains or losses on these derivative instruments are economically offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. Effective March 17, 2009, Tyco changed its jurisdiction of incorporation from Bermuda to Switzerland. Until January 1, 2011 Tyco intends to make dividend payments in the form of a reduction of capital denominated in Swiss francs. However, the Company expects to actually pay dividends in U.S. dollars, based on exchange rates in effect shortly before the payment date. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to the Swiss franc between the date the dividend is declared and paid will increase or decrease the U.S. dollar amount required to be paid. The Company manages the potential variability in cash flows associated with the dividend payments by entering into derivative financial instruments used as economic hedges of the underlying risk. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Swiss franc would result in a $20 million net decrease in the fair value of the contracts. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Swiss franc would result in a $24 million net increase in the fair value of the contracts. However, gains or losses on these derivative instruments are economically offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. Previously, we hedged our investment in certain foreign operations. In December 2006, due to required changes to the legal entity structure to facilitate the Separation, the Company determined that it would no longer consider certain intercompany foreign currency transactions to be long term investments. As a result, the related foreign currency transaction gains and losses on such investments were recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations subsequent to this determination rather than in the currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income within shareholders equity. Forward contracts that were previously designated as hedges of these net investments continued to be used to manage this exposure but were no longer designated as net investment hedges. During fiscal 2009, we designated certain intercompany loans as permanent in nature. As of September 25, 2009, $3.0 billion of intercompany loans have been designated as permanent in nature and for the year ended September 25, 2009, we recorded the cumulative translation loss through 67 Table of Contents accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income related to these loans, which had no material impact for fiscal 2009 and $141 million for fiscal 2008. Interest Rate Exposures Our long term debt portfolio primarily consists of fixed rate instruments. The Company manages its interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swap transactions with financial institutions acting as principal counterparties, which were designated as fair value hedges for accounting purposes. During 2009, the Company entered into the interest rate swap transactions with the objective of managing the exposure to interest rate risk by converting the interest rates on $1.4 billion of fixed rate debt to variable rates. In these contracts, the Company agreed with financial institutions acting as principal counterparties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated on an agreed upon notional principal amount. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates as of September 25, 2009 would result in a $22 million net decrease in the fair value of the contracts. Conversely, a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates as of September 25, 2009 would result in a $22 million net increase in the fair value of the contracts. Commodity Exposures We are exposed to volatility in the prices of raw materials used in some of our products and may, in limited circumstances, enter into hedging contracts to manage those exposures. These exposures are monitored as an integral part of our risk management program. During 2009, the Company did not hedge its exposure attributable to changes in commodity prices but may consider such strategies in the future.  
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the Selected Financial Data and our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those under the headings "Risk Factors" and "Forward Looking Information." Introduction The Consolidated Financial Statements include the consolidated results of Tyco International Ltd., a company organized under the laws of Switzerland, and its subsidiaries (hereinafter collectively referred to as "we," the "Company" or "Tyco"). The financial statements have been prepared in United States dollars ("USD") and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Company operates in the following business segments: ADT Worldwide designs, sells, installs, services and monitors electronic security systems for residential, commercial, industrial and governmental customers. Flow Control designs, manufactures, sells and services valves, pipes, fittings, valve automation and heat tracing products for the oil, gas and other energy markets along with general process industries and the water and wastewater markets. Fire Protection Services designs, sells, installs and services fire detection and fire suppression systems for commercial, industrial and governmental customers. Electrical and Metal Products designs, manufactures and sells galvanized steel tubing, armored wire and cable and other metal products for non residential construction, electrical, fire and safety and mechanical customers. Safety Products designs, manufactures and sells fire suppression, electronic, security and life safety products, including fire suppression products, breathing apparatus, intrusion security, access control and video management systems. In addition, Safety Products manufactures products installed and serviced by ADT Worldwide and Fire Protection Services. We also provide general corporate services to our segments and these costs are reported as Corporate and Other. References to the segment data are to the Companys continuing operations. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The Company has realigned certain business operations as of September 27, 2008, which resulted in certain prior period segment amounts being recast. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Overview and Outlook Overall, fiscal year 2009 results were negatively affected by the economic downturn, which adversely impacted our businesses across nearly all geographies and industries. Revenue decreased by $3.0 billion, or 14.7%, compared to 2008, and goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges were largely responsible for an operating loss of $1.5 billion for the year, compared to operating income of $1.9 billion in 2008. Approximately one half of the 2009 revenue decline was due to the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar during 2009, as over half of our revenue is generated outside the U.S. The remaining revenue decline was due in large part to our Electrical and Metal Products business, 35 Table of Contents which saw historically low volumes in 2009. The impact of the weakened global economy on product and systems installation revenue also significantly contributed to the year over year decline. On the other hand, service revenue continued to grow as a percentage of our overall revenue, from 35% in 2008 to 39% in 2009. Our service revenues are principally derived from our ADT Worldwide and Fire Protection Services businesses, and represent a predictable and consistent source of revenue. Recurring revenue in our ADT Worldwide business now represents approximately 55% of ADTs total revenue compared to approximately 50% in 2008. In the Fire Protection Services business, service revenue increased as a percentage of Fire Protections total revenue from 48% in 2008 to 49% in 2009. Operating income declined in 2009 compared to 2008 due in large part to non cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of approximately $2.7 billion during 2009. Operating income was also negatively affected by charges related to restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture activity of approximately $251 million and charges related to legacy legal matters of approximately $125 million. To a lesser degree, operating income was negatively impacted by reduced volumes due to the economic downturn. Operating income benefited from a number of key cost containment actions taken in 2009 and 2008, as well as restructuring actions taken in prior periods. We continue to be aggressive in identifying cost saving opportunities and restructuring activities that should benefit the Company when the economy improves. During 2010, we expect to incur an additional $100 million to $150 million of charges related to restructuring activity. As of September 25, 2009, the Companys cash balance was $2.4 billion, as compared to $1.5 billion as of September 26, 2008. The increase from 2008 to 2009 was primarily due to cash flow from operating activities and proceeds received from the issuance of long term debt. In 2010, we expect to continue to use our cash to fund internal growth opportunities, improve productivity across all of our businesses, make acquisitions that strategically fit within our ADT Worldwide, Fire Protection Services and Flow Control businesses and return capital to shareholders. In 2010, we expect to continue our portfolio refinement efforts by exiting areas that have not provided, and are not expected to provide, an adequate return on investment. Finally, in 2010, we will continue to focus on growing revenue in key emerging markets and, as noted above, taking advantage of restructuring opportunities that are expected to provide significant future cost savings. Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairments Annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, and more frequently if triggering events occur, the Company tests goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible assets with its carrying amount. During the second quarter of 2009, the Company concluded that its EMEA Security and EMEA Fire reporting units within the ADT Worldwide and Fire Protection Services segments, respectively, Electrical and Metal Products reporting unit within the Electrical and Metal Products segment and Access Control and Video Systems ("ACVS"), Life Safety and Sensormatic Retail Solutions ("SRS") reporting units within the Safety Products segment experienced triggering events such that the carrying values of these reporting units likely exceeded their fair values. As a result of the triggering events, the Company performed long lived asset, goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests for these reporting units and certain of the Companys trade names and franchise rights. The results of the goodwill impairment tests indicated that the implied goodwill amount was less than the carrying amount of goodwill for each of the aforementioned reporting units. The Company recorded an aggregate non cash impairment charge of $2.6 billion ($2.6 billion after tax) during the second quarter of 2009. The non cash impairment charge was recorded in goodwill and intangible asset impairments in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations for the quarter ended March 27, 2009. Also, during the second quarter of 2009, the Companys estimates of future cash flows used in determining the fair value of its Safety Products segment Sensormatic tradename as well as certain 36 Table of Contents ADT Worldwide segment franchise rights were revised downward relative to the estimates used in the Companys tests during the fourth quarter of 2008. The results of the impairment test indicated that the Safety Products Sensormatic tradename and ADT Worldwide franchise rights estimated fair values were less than their respective carrying amounts. As a result, the Company recorded an aggregate non cash impairment charge of $64 million ($40 million after tax) during the second quarter of 2009. The non cash impairment charge was recorded in goodwill and intangible asset impairments in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations for the quarter ended March 27, 2009. Operating Results Net revenue, operating (loss) income and net (loss) income for the years ended September 25, 2009, September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007 were as follows ($ in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Revenue from product sales $ 10,482 $ 13,064 $ 11,816 Service revenue 6,755 7,135 6,661 Net revenue $ 17,237 $ 20,199 $ 18,477 Operating (loss) income $ (1,487 ) $ 1,941 $ (1,732 ) Interest income 44 110 104 Interest expense (301 ) (396 ) (313 ) Other expense, net (7 ) (224 ) (255 ) (Loss) income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest (1,751 ) 1,431 (2,196 ) Income tax expense (78 ) (335 ) (324 ) Minority interest (4 ) (1 ) (4 ) (Loss) income from continuing operations (1,833 ) 1,095 (2,524 ) Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes 35 458 782 Net (loss) income $ (1,798 ) $ 1,553 $ (1,742 ) Net revenue decreased $3.0 billion, or 14.7%, for 2009 as compared to 2008, in large part due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which negatively affected 2009 by $1.5 billion. The remaining decrease in revenue was driven primarily by lower volume of steel products in our Electrical and Metal Products segment and weakness in the commercial markets, including the retailer end market, which negatively impacted our ADT Worldwide and Safety Products segments. Revenues were positively affected by $110 million for acquisitions and divestitures, primarily in our ADT Worldwide segment. 37  Table of Contents Operating income decreased $3.4 billion to an operating loss of $1.5 billion for 2009. The operating loss included an aggregate goodwill impairment charge of $2.6 billion relating to reporting units in our Electrical and Metal Products, ADT Worldwide, Fire Protection Services and Safety Products segments and intangible asset impairment charges of $64 million relating to assets at our ADT Worldwide and Safety Products segments for 2009. Additionally, lower volumes primarily in our Electrical and Metal Products and Safety Products segments negatively impacted operating income. In addition, 2009 included legacy legal settlement charges of $125 million as well as restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net of $251 million. Operating income for 2008 included Separation related costs of $4 million, restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net of $247 million and a legacy settlement charge of $29 million, offset by a credit of $10 million for class action settlement recoveries. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected operating income by $61 million for 2009.

Segment Results The segment discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in results for each of our segments included in continuing operations. ADT Worldwide Net revenue, goodwill and intangible asset impairments, operating income and operating margin for ADT Worldwide for the years ended September 25, 2009, September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007 were as follows ($ in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Revenue from product sales $ 2,226 $ 2,668 $ 2,542 Service revenue 4,789 5,063 4,746 Net revenue $ 7,015 $ 7,731 $ 7,288 Goodwill and intangible asset impairments $ 635 $ 1 $ 52 Operating income 233 906 817 Operating margin (1) 11.7 % 11.2 % (1)Certain operating margins have not been presented as management believes such calculations are not meaningful. 38 Table of Contents Net revenue by geographic area for ADT Worldwide for the years ended September 25, 2009, September 26, 2008, September 28, 2007 was as follows ($ in millions): 2009 2008 2007 North America $ 4,170 $ 4,218 $ 4,094 Europe, Middle East and Africa 1,834 2,355 2,214 Rest of World 1,011 1,158 980 $ 7,015 $ 7,731 $ 7,288 Net revenue for ADT Worldwide decreased $716 million, or 9.3%, during 2009 as compared to 2008. This decrease was primarily driven by the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $590 million. Revenue was positively affected by $152 million for the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Revenue from product sales decreased 16.6% and service revenue decreased 5.4%. Revenue from product sales includes sales and installation of electronic security and other systems. Service revenue is comprised of electronic security services and maintenance, including the monitoring of burglar alarms, fire alarms and other life safety systems as well as services related to retailer anti theft systems. Approximately 55% of ADTs total net revenue is contractual and is considered recurring revenue. Recurring revenue declined 3.6% during 2009 primarily as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which unfavorably impacted recurring revenue by 7.5% offset by growth in North America and Asia. Systems installation and service revenue declined 15.3% partially due to a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which unfavorably impacted system installation and service revenue by 8.3%, and lower sales volume due to continued weakness in the commercial markets, including the retailer end market. Geographically, revenue in North America decreased $48 million, or 1.1%, resulting from reduced spending primarily in the commercial markets, including the retailer end market. Revenue in EMEA decreased $521 million, or 22.1%, largely as a result of foreign currency exchange rates, which had an unfavorable impact of $323 million. The remaining decrease in EMEA was primarily a result of a decline in systems installation and service revenue due to a slowdown in the commercial markets, including the retailer end market. Revenue declined $147 million, or 12.7%, in the Rest of World geographies, which was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $219 million partially offset by growth in Asia and Latin America. Attrition rates for customers in our ADT Worldwide business increased over the prior year to 13.4% on a trailing 12 month basis for 2009, as compared to 12.9% for 2008 and 12.3% in 2007. The increased attrition was primarily due to adverse market conditions in the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, South Africa, Asia and Australia. Operating income in 2009 decreased $673 million as compared to 2008. Based on the deterioration in the commercial markets, including the retailer end market discussed above, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $613 million related to its ADT EMEA reporting unit and intangible asset impairment charges of $22 million related to certain franchise rights within North America during the second quarter of 2009. The decrease is also related to the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $44 million. The decrease was further driven by the decline in sales volume as well as an increase in bad debt charges, both as a result of the weakness experienced in the commercial markets, including the retailer end market, and the current adverse global economic conditions. Additionally, advertising costs increased which adversely affected operating income. Operating income was negatively impacted by restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges of $87 million in 2009. Operating income in 2008 included restructuring charges of $94 million and expenses of $51 million primarily to convert customers from analog to digital signal transmission in North America. There were no charges related to converting customers to digital signal during 2009. The decline in operating income was partially offset by savings realized through cost containment and restructuring actions. 39 Table of Contents Net revenue for ADT Worldwide increased $443 million, or 6.1%, during 2008, with product revenue up 5.0% and service revenue up 6.7%, as compared to 2007. Approximately 50% of ADTs total net revenue is contractual and is considered recurring revenue. Overall, recurring revenue grew 7.2% during 2008 while systems installation and service revenue grew 4.9%. Geographically, North America grew 3%, resulting largely from growth in recurring revenue which was partially offset by weakness in the retailer end market. The North America net revenue increase also includes the impact of acquisitions, which contributed $53 million. The year over year net revenue increase in North America was partially offset by weakness in the retailer end market during the fourth quarter of 2008. Revenue in the EMEA region increased $141 million, or 6.4%, as a result of foreign currency exchange rates which had a favorable impact of $142 million. This increase was partially offset by a decline in systems installation and service revenue due to weakness in the retailer end market as well as commercial softness primarily in the United Kingdom. The 18.2% revenue growth in the Rest of World geographies was primarily driven by growth in both recurring revenue and contracting across all regions. The Rest of the World increase included the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $30 million. Overall, the ADT Worldwide net revenue increase included the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $204 million. The net impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and other activity positively affected revenue by $27 million. Operating margin in ADT Worldwide increased to 11.7% in 2008 from 11.2% in 2007. North America is one of the most profitable geographic areas for ADT Worldwide with 2008 and 2007 operating margin of 15.8% and 16.9%, respectively. Margins in North America were negatively impacted by $57 million of restructuring and asset impairments in 2008 compared to $6 million in 2007. Restructuring charges in 2008 include $58 million relating to the reacquisition of certain franchise rights that were deemed to be unfavorable to the Company. There were no charges related to the reacquisition of franchise rights in 2007. In addition, North America incurred $48 million and $12 million to convert customers from analog to digital signal transmissions in 2008 and 2007, respectively. North America operating margins benefited from growth in recurring revenue partially offset by declines in the retailer end market. ADT EMEA had 2008 and 2007 operating margin of 5.0% and 2.5%, respectively. EMEAs operating income included $34 million of restructuring and impairments in 2008 compared with $67 million in 2007. EMEA margins benefited from reduced costs as a result of the restructuring program, which was partially offset by volume decreases as discussed above. Operating income in 2008 increased $89 million, or 10.9%, as compared to 2007. Factors that positively impacted operating income included increased volume, particularly our higher margin recurring revenue, operational efficiencies, including those achieved from restructuring activities in Europe, lower depreciation and amortization expense and lower long lived asset impairment charges. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense occurred primarily in North America and resulted from changes to the depreciation method and estimated useful lives for pooled subscriber assets and changes to the estimated useful lives of dealer intangible assets. The reduction in depreciation and amortization expense was partially offset by increased net expenses of $51 million, which primarily related to converting customers from analog to digital signal transmissions in North America. Results for 2007 include goodwill impairment charges due to the reorganization of our management and segment reporting structure following the Separation. 40 Table of Contents Flow Control Net revenue, operating income and operating margin for Flow Control for the years ended September 25, 2009, September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007 were as follows ($ in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Revenue from product sales $ 3,580 $ 4,201 $ 3,618 Service revenue 270 217 148 Net revenue $ 3,850 $ 4,418 $ 3,766 Operating income $ 518 $ 618 $ 457 Operating margin 13.5 % 14.0 % 12.1 % Net revenue for Flow Control decreased $568 million, or 12.9%, in 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease in net revenue was primarily driven by the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $462 million. Revenue also decreased due to reduced volume in the water business and reduced project activity in the energy end market of the thermal controls business. The decrease in revenue was partially offset by an increase in the valves business primarily from the energy end market in EMEA. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures unfavorably impacted net revenue by $3 million in 2009 and favorably impacted net revenue by $16 million in 2008. Operating income decreased $100 million, or 16.2%, in 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $73 million as well as decreased volume in the water businesses discussed above offset by margin improvements in the valves business. Margins were also negatively impacted by restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges of $29 million. Additionally, management estimates that $5 million of additional charges resulting from restructuring actions were incurred during 2009. Restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges were $8 million in 2008. Additionally, selling, general and administrative expenses in 2008 included an environmental remediation charge of $6 million related to the closure of a facility in North America. The decline in operating income was partially offset by savings realized through cost containment and restructuring actions. Net revenue for Flow Control increased $652 million, or 17.3%, in 2008 as compared to 2007. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by volume growth from continued strength in the valves and thermal businesses, and to a lesser extent, the water business. The increase in the valves business was primarily driven by project growth in the oil and gas industry while the thermal business benefited primarily from strong project growth coupled with increased selling prices. While revenue within the water business increased year over year, project activity declined during the second half of 2008, primarily in Australia. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted revenue by $314 million. The net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other activity positively affected revenue by $6 million. Operating income increased $161 million, or 35.2%, in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily from revenue growth, as well as volume efficiencies. Flow Control incurred restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net of $8 million, compared to $28 million in 2007. Additionally, selling, general and administrative expenses in 2008 included an environmental remediation charge of $6 million related to the closure of a facility in North America as compared to no charges in 2007. 41 Table of Contents Fire Protection Services Net revenue, goodwill and intangible asset impairments, operating income and operating margin for Fire Protection Services for the years ended September 25, 2009 September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007 were as follows ($ in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Revenue from product sales $ 1,751 $ 2,013 $ 1,982 Service revenue 1,677 1,826 1,744 Net revenue $ 3,428 $ 3,839 $ 3,726 Goodwill and intangible asset impairments $ 180 $ 9 $ Operating income 68 325 283 Operating margin (1) 8.5 % 7.6 % (1)Certain operating margins have not been presented as management believes such calculations are not meaningful. Net revenue for Fire Protection Services decreased $411 million, or 10.7%, during 2009 as compared to 2008. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $294 million. Additionally, revenue declined due to the continued weakness in the commercial market and current adverse global economic conditions. Revenue from product sales includes sales and installation of fire protection and other systems. Service revenue consists of inspection, maintenance, service and monitoring of fire detection and suppression systems. Geographically, revenue in our international fire businesses decreased by $294 million largely due to the impact of unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates discussed above as well as the continued weakness in the European commercial markets. Additionally, revenue in our North America SimplexGrinnell business decreased by $116 million primarily due to a decline in systems installation and upgrade activity in the sprinkler business. Operating income decreased $257 million during 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease was primarily due to a $180 million goodwill impairment in EMEA recorded during 2009 compared to a $9 million goodwill impairment in Latin America recorded during 2008. The decrease was further driven by the decline in sales volume discussed above as well as an increase in bad debt charges, both as a result of the weakness experienced in the commercial markets and the current adverse global economic conditions. There were restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges of $45 million in 2009 as compared to $25 million in 2008. Additionally, operating income decreased due to the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $9 million. The decline in operating income was partially offset by savings realized through cost containment and restructuring actions. Net revenue for Fire Protection Services increased $113 million, or 3.0%, during 2008 as compared to 2007, driven by increases in both product sales and service revenues. This increase in product sales was aided by foreign currency exchange rates, which had a favorable impact of $74 million. The increase in service revenue related to growth in service work and sprinkler contracting in North America and Asia primarily as a result of an increase in demand from the education and healthcare industries in North America and commercial expansion in the Asia region. Additionally, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact of $60 million on service revenue. The increase was partially offset by reduced revenue in EMEA and Australia/New Zealand primarily due to a decline in contracting revenue as a result of a strategic initiative to be more selective in our pursuit of contracts. Additionally, the net revenue increase was partially offset due to the planned exit of low performing non core activities in Latin America and Asia. Overall, the Fire Protection Services net revenue increase included the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $134 million. 42 Table of Contents Operating income increased $42 million, or 14.8%, during 2008 as compared to 2007 resulting largely from increased volume and improved margins, primarily in North America, and to a lesser extent, Asia and EMEA. The increase in operating income during 2008 was partially offset by $25 million of restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges. Also, operating income was unfavorably impacted by $9 million due to a goodwill impairment in the Latin America reporting unit. Electrical and Metal Products Net revenue, goodwill and intangible asset impairments, operating income and operating margin for Electrical and Metal Products for the years ended September 25, 2009, September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007 were as follows ($ in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Revenue from product sales $ 1,389 $ 2,266 $ 1,970 Service revenue 3 6 4 Net revenue $ 1,392 $ 2,272 $ 1,974 Goodwill and intangible asset impairments $ 935 $ $ Operating (loss) income (940 ) 342 159 Operating margin (1) 15.1 % 8.1 % (1)Certain operating margins have not been presented as management believes such calculations are not meaningful. Net revenue for Electrical and Metal Products decreased $880 million, or 38.7%, in 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to lower volume and selling prices of steel products largely resulting from a decline in the commercial market in North America. Lower volume and selling prices for armored cable products also contributed to the decline. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of $52 million. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures negatively affected revenue by approximately $31 million. Operating income decreased $1.3 billion in 2009 as compared to 2008. Based on the sales volume decrease as well as the significant decline in the price of steel, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $935 million during the second quarter of 2009. There was no goodwill impairment recorded during 2008. The decrease in operating income also related to volume declines as well as lower spreads for steel products. Spreads for steel products continued to decline as a direct result of higher raw material costs and lower selling prices. Lower restructuring and divestiture charges incurred in 2009 as compared to similar charges incurred in 2008 partially offset the decline in operating income discussed above. Results for 2009 included restructuring and divestiture charges of $21 million as compared to $43 million for 2008. Additionally, management estimates that $1 million of additional charges resulting from restructuring actions were incurred during 2009. Net revenue for Electrical and Metal Products increased $298 million, or 15.1%, in 2008 as compared to 2007. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by selling price increases for steel tubular products and to a lesser extent armored cable products partially offset by decreased sales volume for both products. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact of $44 million. Operating income increased $183 million, or 115.1%, in 2008 as compared to 2007. The increase in operating income was primarily due to favorable spreads on both steel tubular and armored cable products. Income generated by higher selling prices for both steel tubular and armored cable products were partially offset by decreased sales volume for both products. Operational excellence initiatives resulted in reductions in production cost rates for both steel tubular and armored cable products. The increase in operating income during 2008 was partially offset by $43 million of restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, as compared to $7 million in 2007. 43  Table of Contents Safety Products Net revenue, goodwill and intangible asset impairments, operating income and operating margin for Safety Products for the years ended September 25, 2009, September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007 were as follows ($ in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Revenue from product sales $ 1,536 $ 1,916 $ 1,704 Service revenue 16 18 15 Net revenue $ 1,552 $ 1,934 $ 1,719 Goodwill and intangible asset impairments $ 955 $ $ 7 Operating (loss) income (789 ) 284 274 Operating margin (1) 14.7 % 15.9 % (1)Certain operating margins have not been presented as management believes such calculations are not meaningful. Net revenue for Safety Products decreased $382 million, or 19.8%, during 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease is primarily related to reduced volume in our fire suppression business, life safety and electronic security businesses, which continued to be impacted by the soft economic conditions. The remaining decrease is related to the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $122 million. The decrease in our fire suppression business was primarily due to reduced spending in the commercial construction market. The decrease in the life safety business was primarily due to reduced municipal spending. The electronic security business decrease was primarily due to the slow down in the retail sector, as retail capital projects and new store openings were canceled or delayed. Operating income decreased $1.1 billion in 2009 as compared to 2008. The decline is primarily attributable to goodwill and intangible impairment charges of $955 million recorded during the quarter ended March 27, 2009 as a result of the continued slowdown in the commercial and retail markets. As discussed above, decreased sales volume within the fire suppression, life safety and electronic security businesses also negatively impacted operating income. Operating income was negatively impacted by restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges of $46 million during 2009. Additionally, management estimates that $9 million of additional charges resulting from restructuring actions were incurred during 2009. The same period in the prior year included $73 million of restructuring and asset impairment charges. Operating income also decreased by $18 million due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Operating income was also negatively impacted by a charge of $8 million relating to the amount of depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recorded had a business that was previously classified as held for sale been continuously classified as held and used (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Net revenue for Safety Products increased $215 million, or 12.5%, during 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily from strong performance in the fire suppression, and to a lesser extent electronic security and life safety businesses. The increase in the fire suppression business was driven by continued growth in the energy and marine sectors, favorable product mix and increased selling prices to offset increasing raw material costs. The increase in the life safety business was primarily driven by growth in North America as a result of increased spending by fire departments and from increased selling prices. The increase in the electronic security business was partially due to higher volume and new product introductions primarily related to casinos and schools. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $76 million also contributed to the increase in revenue. Operating income increased $10 million, or 3.6% in 2008 as compared to 2007. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to increased sales volume along with the impact of cost 44 Table of Contents savings from operational excellence initiatives. The increase in operating income during 2008 was partially offset by $73 million of restructuring, asset impairment, and divestiture charges, net as compared to $29 million in 2007. Corporate and Other Corporate expense for 2009 was $43 million higher as compared to the prior year, primarily resulting from a charge of $125 million related to the settlement of legacy securities matters, which was partially offset by $16 million benefit related to a settlement reached with a former executive. Additionally, corporate expense in 2009 included $16 million of restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges. Corporate expense for 2008 included net charges of $28 million composed of a $29 million charge for a legacy legal settlement, $4 million of separation costs and $5 million for restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net, offset by a credit of $10 million for class action settlement recoveries. The remaining decrease in corporate expense is primarily related to cost reduction initiatives and the restructuring program. Corporate expense for 2008 was $3.2 billion lower as compared to the prior year, primarily resulting from various charges in 2007, including the class action settlement charge of $2.862 billion, separation costs of $117 million and net restructuring and asset impairment charges of $40 million primarily related to the consolidation of certain headquarter functions. Corporate expense for 2008 included net charges of $28 million composed of a $29 million charge for a legacy legal settlement, $4 million of separation costs and $5 million for restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net, offset by a credit of $10 million for class action settlement recoveries. The remaining decrease in corporate expense is primarily related to cost reduction initiatives and the restructuring program. Legal Settlements In the first half of fiscal 2009, the Company settled a number of legal matters stemming from alleged violations of federal securities laws committed by former senior management, including several lawsuits from plaintiffs that had opted out of the June 2007 class action settlement, for an aggregate amount of approximately $90 million. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Companys share of this amount was approximately $24 million, with Covidien and Tyco Electronics responsible for approximately $38 million and $28 million, respectively. During the second quarter of 2009, the Company concluded that its best estimate of probable loss for its unresolved legacy securities matters was $375 million. Due to the fact that any payments ultimately made in connection with these matters would be subject to the sharing provisions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Company also recorded receivables from Covidien and Tyco Electronics in the amounts of $158 million and $116 million, respectively. As a result, the Company recorded a net charge of $101 million during the quarter ended March 27, 2009 in selling, general, and administrative expenses related to these unresolved matters. In the second half of fiscal 2009, the Company agreed to settle with all of the remaining plaintiffs that had opted out of the class action settlement as well as plaintiffs who had brought ERISA related claims for a total of $271 million. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Companys share of the settlement amount was approximately $73 million, with Covidien and Tyco Electronics responsible for approximately $114 million and $84 million, respectively. This settlement activity did not result in the Company recording a charge to its Consolidated Statements of Operations as the Company had established a reserve for its best estimate of the amount of loss during the second quarter of 2009 as discussed above. The Company continues to believe that the accrual remaining as of September 25, 2009 is its best estimate for the remaining unresolved claims. Although the Company has reserved its best estimate of probable loss, related to unresolved legacy securities claims, their 45 Table of Contents ultimate resolution could differ from the estimate and could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Interest Income and Expense Interest income was $44 million in 2009, as compared to $110 million and $104 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in interest income in 2009, and the increase in interest income in 2008, is primarily related to $47 million of interest earned on funds held in escrow prior to settlement of the class action during 2008 and lower investment yields during 2009. Interest expense was $301 million in 2009, as compared to $396 million in 2008 and $313 million in 2007. The decrease in interest expense in 2009 primarily relates to interest on the class action settlement liability of $47 million and cost related to our bridge loan of $48 million in 2008. The increase in interest expense in 2008 was a result of $47 million of interest on funds held in escrow related to the class action settlement liability, and increased costs related to our bridge loan and revolving credit facilities. The weighted average interest rate on total debt outstanding as of September 25, 2009, September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007 was 6.6%, 6.2% and 6.3%, respectively. In 2007, net interest amounts were proportionally allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics based on the debt amounts that we believe were utilized by Covidien and Tyco Electronics historically inclusive of amounts directly incurred, and is included in discontinued operations. Allocated net interest was calculated using our historical weighted average interest rate on debt, including the impact of interest rate swap agreements. The portion of Tycos interest income allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics was $35 million during 2007. The portion of Tycos interest expense allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics was $242 million during 2007. Other Expense, Net Other expense, net was $7 million in 2009 compared to $224 million in 2008 and $255 million in 2007. Other expense, net in 2009 primarily relates to a $14 million charge recorded as a result of a decrease in the receivables due from Covidien and Tyco Electronics under the Tax Sharing Agreement, which was partially offset by income of $5 million relating to a gain on derivative contracts used to economically hedge the foreign currency risk related to the Swiss franc denominated dividends. Other expense, net during 2008, includes $258 million on extinguishment of debt related to the consent solicitation and exchange offers and termination of the bridge loan facility offset by income of $6 million recorded in connection with the settlement of its 3.125% convertible senior debentures and related financial instruments. See Notes 12 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We also recorded other than temporary impairments and realized losses on the sale of investments of $6 million related primarily to investments in corporate debt. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, we recorded $40 million of income as a result of an increase in the receivables due from Covidien and Tyco Electronics under the Tax Sharing Agreement in connection with the adoption of the guidance pertaining to the accounting for uncertain income taxes. We also recorded $6 million of expense for other activity in accordance with the Tax Sharing Agreement during 2008. During 2007, other expense, net consisted primarily of a $259 million loss on early extinguishment of debt incurred in connection with debt tender offers undertaken in connection with the Separation, for which no tax benefit is available. This charge consists primarily of premiums paid and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts. The total loss on early extinguishment of debt was 46 Table of Contents $647 million, with $259 million included in continuing operations and $388 million allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics and included in discontinued operations. Income Taxes Effective Income Tax Rate The effective income tax rate for 2009 is not meaningful primarily as a result of the loss driven by the goodwill impairment charges of $2.6 billion, for which almost no tax benefit is available. Our effective income tax rate was 23.4% for 2008. Income taxes during 2008 were positively impacted by increased profitability in lower tax rate jurisdictions and release of deferred tax valuation allowances partially offset by enacted tax law changes that negatively impacted the non U.S. deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate for 2007 is not meaningful primarily as a result of the class action settlement charge, net of $2.862 billion and the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $259 million for which no tax benefit is available. Additionally, taxes for 2007 were negatively impacted by tax costs related to the Separation and were favorably impacted by the release of a deferred tax valuation allowance related to non U.S. tax rulings received during the period and reduced reserve requirements on certain legacy tax matters. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $791 million and $742 million as of September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. The valuation allowance was calculated and recorded when we determined that it was more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets would not be realized. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as payment is not expected within one year. Other Income Tax Matters In connection with the spin offs of Covidien and Tyco Electronics from Tyco, Tyco entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that governs the rights and obligations of each party with respect to certain pre Separation income tax liabilities. More specifically, Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics share 27%, 42% and 31%, respectively, of shared income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to Tycos, Covidiens and Tyco Electronics U.S. and certain non U.S. income tax returns. All costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are shared equally among the parties. Consistent with the sharing provisions of the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco had a net receivable from Covidien and Tyco Electronics of $98 million and $126 million as of September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008, respectively. In addition, as of both September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008, Tyco had a recorded liability of $554 million representing the fair value of Tycos obligations under the Tax Sharing Agreement. Tyco and its subsidiaries income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and 47 Table of Contents proposed tax adjustments. The Company is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest have been assessed as uncertain income tax positions and recorded as appropriate. For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos income taxes, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Divestitures We have continued to assess the strategic fit of our various businesses and we will pursue divestiture of businesses that do not align with our long term strategy. Held for Sale and Reflected as Continuing Operations During the fourth quarter of 2009, we approved a plan to sell a business in our ADT Worldwide segment. This business has been classified as held for sale; however, its results of operations are presented in continuing operations as the criteria for discontinued operations have not been met. We have assessed and determined that the carrying value of this business is recoverable and will continue to assess recoverability based on current fair value, less cost to sell, until the business is sold. Fair value used for the impairment assessment was based on existing market conditions. We expect to complete the sale during fiscal 2010. During the third quarter of 2008, we approved a plan to sell a business in the Safety Products segment. This business had been classified as held for sale in our historical Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the second quarter of 2009, due to a change in strategy by management, we decided not to sell the business. As a result, the business no longer satisfied the requirements to be classified as held for sale in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 27, 2009. Accordingly, the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 26, 2008 was recast to reclassify the business from held for sale to held and used. We measured the business at the lower of its (i) carrying amount before it was classified as held for sale, adjusted for depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recognized had the business been continuously classified as held and used, or (ii) fair value at the date the decision not to sell was made. We recorded a charge of $8 million in the second quarter of 2009 relating to the amount of depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recorded had the asset been continuously classified as held and used. Discontinued Operations As previously reported in our periodic filings, in July 2008, we substantially completed the sale of our Infrastructure Services business, which met the criteria to be presented as discontinued operations. In order to complete the sale of Earth Tech Brasil Ltda. ("ET Brasil") and Earth Tech UK businesses and certain assets in China, we were required to obtain consents and approvals to transfer the legal ownership of the business and assets. On January 22, 2009, we received the necessary consents and approvals to transfer the legal ownership of our ET Brasil business to Carioca Christiani Nielsen Engenharia S.A. and received cash proceeds of $13 million. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we sold our Earth Tech UK business and received net cash proceeds of $53 million. However, the gain was deferred until receipt of the necessary consents and approvals. On May 12, 2009, we received the necessary consents and approvals to transfer the legal ownership of our Earth Tech UK business to AECOM Technologies Corporation ("AECOM") and realized the deferred gain in our Consolidated Statements of Operations during the third quarter of 2009. Furthermore, on February 27, 2009, we received the necessary consents to transfer certain of the China assets and received cash proceeds of $18 million. On May 8, 2009, we received the necessary consents to transfer additional China assets and received cash proceeds of $6 million. On July 2, 2009 we received the necessary consents and approvals 48 Table of Contents to transfer the remaining assets in China and received cash proceeds of $24 million. As a result of the fiscal 2009 dispositions, a net pre tax gain of $33 million was recorded in income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended September 25, 2009. During 2008, we sold our Empresa de Transmissao de Energia do Oeste Ltda. ("ETEO") business, Ancon Building Products ("Ancon") business, Nippon Dry Chemical Co., Ltd. ("NDC") business, and a European manufacturer of public address products and acoustic systems. As discussed above, we substantially completed the sale of our Infrastructure Services Business, during the fourth quarter of 2008. These businesses met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and have been included in discontinued operations in all periods presented. In May 2008, we sold 100% of the stock of ETEO, a Brazilian subsidiary of our Infrastructure Services business for $338 million of net cash proceeds and recorded a pre tax gain of $232 million, including the effects of the economic hedge of the purchase price discussed below. The gain was recorded in income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended September 26, 2008. ETEO was part of our Corporate and Other segment. During September 2007, we entered into an economic hedge of the Brazilian Real denominated contractual sale price of the ETEO business. Since the hedging transaction was directly linked to the proceeds from the sale of a business that was reflected in discontinued operations, we began including the impact of the hedge in discontinued operations during the first quarter of 2008. During the third quarter of 2008, we incurred a pre tax loss of $36 million on this hedge. The impact of the hedge in 2007 was not material. Additionally in fiscal year 2008, we settled a contract dispute arising under our former Infrastructure Services business. In connection with the settlement, we assessed our assets under the original contract and concluded the assets were no longer recoverable, resulting in a $51 million charge to discontinued operations. During April 2008, we sold Ancon, a manufacturer of stainless steel products used in masonry construction. Ancon was part of our Corporate and Other segment. The sale was completed for $164 million in net cash proceeds and a pre tax gain of $100 million was recorded which was largely exempt from tax. The gain was recorded in income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended September 26, 2008. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we received an additional $6 million of proceeds related to the sale of Ancon. During February 2008, we sold NDC, a company in the Japanese fire protection industry. NDC was part of our Fire Protection Services and Safety Products segments. The sale was completed for $50 million in net cash proceeds and a pre tax gain of $7 million was recorded. The gain was recorded in income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended September 26, 2008. During January 2008, we sold a European manufacturer of public address products and acoustic systems, which was part of our Fire Protection Services segment and recorded an $8 million pre tax loss on sale. The loss was recorded in income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the first quarter of 2007, Aquas Industriales de Jose, C.A. ("AIJ"), a joint venture that was majority owned by Infrastructure Services, was sold for $42 million in net cash proceeds and a pre tax gain of $19 million was recorded. The gain was recorded in discontinued operations, net of income taxes in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. AIJ was part of our Corporate and Other segment. 49 Table of Contents During the third quarter of 2007, we completed the Separation and have presented our Healthcare and Electronics businesses as discontinued operations in all periods presented. In each period prior to the Separation, net interest and loss on early extinguishment of debt, which is included in other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, amounts were proportionally allocated to Covidien and Tyco Electronics based on the debt amounts that we believe were utilized by Covidien and Tyco Electronics historically inclusive of amounts directly incurred. Allocated net interest was calculated using our historical weighted average interest rate on debt including the impact of interest rate swap agreements. These allocated amounts were included in discontinued operations. During 2007, allocated interest income, interest expense and other expense, net was $35 million, $242 million and $388 million, respectively. During 2007, we incurred pre tax separation costs related primarily to professional services and employee related costs of $154 million and $289 million, respectively, in discontinued operations. Additionally, the year ended September 28, 2007 includes tax charges related to the Separation primarily for the write off of deferred tax assets that are no longer realizable of $88 million in discontinued operations. We have used available information to develop our best estimates for certain assets and liabilities related to the Separation. In limited instances, final determination of the balances will be made in subsequent periods. During the year ended September 28, 2007, $72 million was recorded through shareholders equity, primarily related to a cash true up adjustment of $57 million and $15 million of other items. During the year ended September 26, 2008, $70 million of other items were recorded through shareholders equity. During the year ended September 25, 2009, $43 million was recorded through shareholders equity, $9 million of which related to a pre Separation income tax filing in a non U.S. jurisdiction and $34 million of other items. The other items discussed above, which aggregate $119 million, reflect immaterial adjustments to shareholders equity which were recorded to correct the distribution amount at the date of Separation. Adjustments in the future for the impact of filing final income tax returns in certain jurisdictions where those returns include a combination of our, Covidien and or Tyco Electronics legal entities and for certain amended income tax returns for the periods prior to the Separation may be recorded to either shareholders equity or the Consolidated Statements of Operations depending on the specific item giving rise to the adjustment. Acquisitions During the year ended September 25, 2009, cash paid for acquisitions totaled $50 million, which primarily related to the acquisition of Vue Technology, Inc., a provider of radio frequency identification ("RFID") technology, by our Safety Products segment. During the year ended September 26, 2008, cash paid for acquisitions totaled $401 million, which primarily related to the acquisition of Winner Security Services LLC ("Winner"), Sensormatic Security Corp. ("SSC") and First Service Security ("FirstService"). During 2007, cash paid for acquisitions totaled $31 million, primarily within our ADT Worldwide, Safety Products and Flow Control segments. These acquisitions were funded utilizing cash from operations. The results of operations of the acquired companies have been included in Tycos consolidated results from the respective acquisition dates. These acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For a detailed discussion of acquisitions, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 50  Table of Contents  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. Depreciation and Amortization Methods for Security Monitoring Related Assets Tyco generally considers assets related to the acquisition of new customers in its electronic security business in three asset categories: internally generated residential subscriber systems, internally generated commercial subscriber systems (collectively referred to as subscriber system assets) and customer accounts acquired through the ADT dealer program (referred to as dealer intangibles). Subscriber system assets include installed property, plant and equipment for which Tyco retains ownership and deferred costs directly related to the customer acquisition and system installation. Subscriber system assets and any deferred revenue resulting from the customer acquisition are accounted for over the expected life of the subscriber. In certain geographical areas where the Company has a large number of customers that behave in a similar manner over time, the Company accounts for subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue using pools, with separate pools for the components of subscriber system assets and any related deferred revenue based on the month and year of acquisition. Effective as of the beginning of the third quarter of 2007, Tyco changed the depreciation method and estimated useful life used to account for pooled subscriber system assets (primarily in North America) and related deferred revenue from the straight line method with lives ranging from 10 to 14 years to an accelerated method with lives up to 15 years. The accelerated method utilizes declining balance rates based on geographical area ranging from 160% to 195% for residential subscriber pools and 145% to 265% for commercial subscriber pools and converts to a straight line methodology when the resulting depreciation charge is greater than that from the accelerated method. The Company will continue to use a straight line method with a 14 year life for non pooled subscriber system assets (primarily in Europe and Asia) and related deferred revenue, with remaining balances written off upon customer termination. The change in the method and estimated useful life used to account for pooled subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue resulted from our ongoing analysis of all pertinent factors, including actual customer attrition data specific to customer categories and geographical areas, demand, competition, and the estimated technological life of the installed systems. The pertinent factors have been influenced by managements ongoing customer retention programs, as well as tactical and strategic initiatives to improve service delivery, customer satisfaction, and the credit worthiness of the subscriber customer base. All pertinent factors, including actual customer attrition data specific to customer categories and geographical areas, demand, competition, and the estimated technological life of the installed systems, will continue to be reviewed by the Company at each balance sheet date to assess the continued appropriateness of methods and estimated useful lives. Effective as of the beginning of the third quarter of 2007, Tyco also changed the estimated useful life of dealer intangibles in geographical areas comprising approximately 90% of the net carrying value of dealer intangibles from 12 to 15 years. The Company continues to amortize dealer intangible assets on an accelerated basis. The change in the estimated useful life used to account for dealer intangibles resulted from our ongoing analysis of all pertinent factors, including actual customer attrition data, demand, competition, and the estimated technological life of the installed systems. The pertinent factors have been influenced by managements ongoing customer retention programs, as well as tactical and strategic initiatives to improve service delivery, customer satisfaction, and the credit worthiness of the subscriber customer base. Attrition rates for customers in our ADT Worldwide business were 13.4%, 12.9% and 12.3% on a trailing 12 month basis for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 51 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Contract sales for the installation of fire protection systems, large security intruder systems and other construction related projects are recorded primarily under the percentage of completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related total cost of the project at completion. The risk of this methodology is its dependence upon estimates of costs at completion, which are subject to the uncertainties inherent in long term contracts. Revisions to cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits each period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they become determinable. If estimates are inaccurate, there is risk that our revenue and profits for the period may be overstated or understated. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience and trend analysis. Loss Contingencies Accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings, self insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on judgment, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates. Additionally, the Company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. Income Taxes In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future pre tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense recorded in the future may be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction. Any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance could result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not currently aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately 52 Table of Contents proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Asset Impairments Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually and more frequently if triggering events occur. In performing these assessments, management relies on various factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable transactions and other market data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors which require judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment. Since judgment is involved in performing fair value measurements used in goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets impairment analyses, there is risk that the carrying values of our goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets may be overstated. We elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for all goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. In the first step of the goodwill impairment test, the Company compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. Fair value for the goodwill impairment test is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the Companys future budgets discounted using the market participants weighted average cost of capital and market indicators of terminal year cash flows. Other valuation methods are used to corroborate the discounted cash flow method. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered potentially impaired and further tests are performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. In the second step of the goodwill impairment test, the Company compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. The Company allocates the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill. Long Lived Assets Assets held and used by the Company, including property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. Tyco performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if impairment exists. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, Tyco groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identified. If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Impairments to long lived assets to be disposed of are recorded based upon the fair value less cost to sell of the applicable assets. The calculation of the fair value of long lived assets is based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of long lived assets, there is a risk that the carrying value of our long lived assets may be overstated or understated. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations. Two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions. The discount rate represents the market rate for high quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of 53 Table of Contents pension benefit obligations. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our present value of pension obligations by approximately $77 million. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected long term rates of return on those types of plan assets, in determining the expected long term return on plan assets. A 50 basis point decrease in the expected long term return on plan assets would increase our pension expense by approximately $7 million. For fiscal 2010, we expect that recent declines in interest rates will increase our pension expense, but is not expected to materially increase required contributions.  Liquidity and Capital Resources On September 30, 2009, Tyco International Finance S.A. ("TIFSA") issued $500 million aggregate principle amount of 4.125% notes due 2014 (the "2014 notes"), which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. TIFSA received net proceeds of approximately $496 million after underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses. On January 9, 2009, TIFSA issued $750 million aggregate principle amount of 8.5% notes due on January 15, 2019, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company (the "2019 notes"). Additionally, the holders of the 2019 notes have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the 2019 Notes on July 15, 2014 at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes tendered, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Otherwise, the 2019 notes mature on January 15, 2019. TIFSA received net proceeds of approximately $745 million after underwriting discounts and offering expenses. The net proceeds of the aforementioned offerings may be used for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment of indebtedness, acquisitions, additions to working capital, repurchase of common shares, capital expenditures and investments in the Companys subsidiaries. In January 2009, TIFSA made a payment of $215 million to extinguish all of its 6.125% notes due 2009. Additionally, in November 2008, TIFSA made a payment of $300 million to extinguish all of its 6.125% notes due 2008. Additionally, in January 2009, we repaid the entire outstanding balance of $686 million on our revolving credit facilities. As of September 25, 2009, there were no amounts drawn under our revolving credit facilities. As of September 25, 2009, the aggregate available commitment under our senior revolving credit facilities was $1.69 billion, $200 million of which was dedicated to backstop all of our commercial paper outstanding as of such date. We continually monitor developments regarding the availability of funds under our revolving credit facilities. Although there is some risk that financial institutions will fail to perform their contractual obligations, particularly in times of credit market distress, we believe that the lenders under our revolving credit facilities are capable of meeting any borrowing requests we may make for the foreseeable future. As discussed above, as of September 25, 2009, we had $200 million of commercial paper outstanding. We continue to experience increased availability within the commercial paper markets. Our multi year revolving credit facilities serve as a backstop to our commercial paper program. In addition to our available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of potential liquidity include committed credit lines, our commercial paper program, public debt and equity markets as well as the ability to sell trade accounts receivable. We continue to balance our operating, investing and financing uses of cash through investment in our existing core businesses, strategic acquisitions and divestitures, dividends and share repurchases. We believe our cash position, amounts available under our credit facilities and cash provided by operating activities will be adequate to cover our operational and business needs. As a result of recent declines in interest rates during 2009, pension costs may increase in fiscal 2010. We will continue to monitor market conditions and assess the impact, if any, on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Approximately 100% of our U.S. and more than 95% of our non U.S. funded pension plans are invested in marketable investments, including publicly traded 54 Table of Contents equity and fixed income securities. Although we do not believe we will be required to make materially higher cash contributions in the next 12 months, if market conditions worsen, we may be required to make incremental cash contributions under local statutory law. The sources of our cash flow from operating activities and the use of a portion of that cash in our operations for the years ended September 25, 2009, September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007 were as follows ($ in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Cash flows from operating activities: Operating (loss) income $ (1,487 ) $ 1,941 $ (1,732 ) Goodwill and intangible asset impairments 2,705 10 59 Non cash restructuring and asset impairment charges, net 23 36 11 Losses on divestitures 13 4 Depreciation and amortization(1) 1,133 1,154 1,148 Non cash compensation expense 103 99 173 Deferred income taxes (83 ) (94 ) (16 ) Provision for losses on accounts receivable and inventory 156 135 94 (Gain) loss on the retirement of debt (2 ) 258 259 Other, net 61 (124 ) (231 ) Class action settlement liability (3,020 ) 2,992 Net change in working capital 142 (646 ) (414 ) Interest income 44 110 104 Interest expense (301 ) (396 ) (313 ) Income tax expense (78 ) (335 ) (324 ) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 2,429 $ (872 ) $ 1,814 Other cash flow items: Capital expenditures, net(2) $ (696 ) $ (706 ) $ (643 ) Decrease in sale of accounts receivable 10 14 7 Accounts purchased from ADT dealer program (543 ) (376 ) (409 ) Purchase accounting and holdback liabilities (2 ) (2 ) (10 ) Voluntary pension contributions 22 4 23 (1)Includes depreciation expense of $617 million, $626 million and $635 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and amortization of intangible assets of $516 million, $528 million and $513 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. (2)Includes net proceeds of $13 million, $28 million and $23 million received for the sale/disposition of property, plant and equipment in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The net change in working capital increased operating cash flow by $142 million in 2009. The components of this change are set forth in detail in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The significant changes in working capital included a $367 million decrease in inventory, a $207 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $106 million decrease in contracts in progress, offset by a $352 million decrease in accounts payable and a $148 million decrease in income taxes, net. During 2009, we completed the sale of all of our remaining Infrastructure Services businesses for net cash proceeds of $66 million. We continue to fund capital expenditures to grow our business, improve the cost structure of our businesses, to invest in new processes and technology, and to maintain high quality production standards. The level of capital expenditures in 2010 is expected to exceed spending levels in 2009 and is also expected to exceed depreciation. 55 Table of Contents During 2009, 2008 and 2007 we paid out $154 million, $187 million and $70 million, respectively, in cash related to restructuring activities. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our restructuring activities. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, related to continuing operations was $291 million, $501 million, and $649 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, Tyco paid $543 million, $376 million and $409 million of cash, respectively, to acquire approximately 512,000, 370,000 and 415,000 customer contracts for electronic security services through the ADT dealer program. As previously discussed, effective June 29, 2007, we completed the Separation. In connection with the Separation, we paid $68 million and $349 million in Separation costs during 2008 and 2007 respectively. Of these amounts, $36 million and $256 million were included in cash flows from discontinued operating activities, respectively. During the second quarter of 2008, Tyco released $2,960 million of funds placed in escrow during the third quarter of 2007 as well as $60 million of interest earned on those funds for the benefit of the class as stipulated in the Courts final order related to the class action settlement. We will continue to divest businesses that do not align with our overall strategy. We expect to use the proceeds from these sales, as well as the cash generated by our operations, to continue to make investments in our businesses that are intended to grow revenue and improve productivity, including our restructuring actions. We expect to also use cash to selectively pursue acquisitions. Pursuant to our share repurchase program, we may repurchase Tyco shares from time to time in open market purchases at prevailing market prices, in negotiated transactions off the market, or pursuant to an approved 10b5 1 trading plan in accordance with applicable regulations. Management believes that cash generated by or available to us should be sufficient to fund our capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future, including quarterly dividend payments. We intend to continue to repurchase shares under our existing $1.0 billion share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors on July 10, 2008 depending on credit market conditions, macroeconomic factors and expectations regarding future cash flows. Capitalization Shareholders equity was $12.9 billion or $27.30 per share, as of September 25, 2009, compared to $15.5 billion or $32.76 per share, as of September 26, 2008. Shareholders equity decreased primarily due to a net loss of $1.8 billion, which was primarily driven by goodwill and intangible asset impairments, dividends declared of $472 million, a $220 million current period change relating to the Companys retirement plans and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $203 million. Total debt was $4.3 billion as of September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008, respectively. Total debt as a percentage of capitalization (total debt and shareholders equity) was 25% as of September 25, 2009 and 22% as of September 26, 2008, respectively. Our cash balance increased to $2.4 billion as of September 25, 2009, as compared to $1.5 billion as of September 26, 2008. This increase in cash was primarily due to cash generated by the operating segments as well as proceeds from issuance of long term debt. 56  Table of Contents Debt Tenders In connection with the settlement of litigation arising from the Separation related to our public debt, on June 3, 2008 we, along with our finance subsidiary TIFSA, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and successor company to Tyco International Group S.A. ("TIGSA"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company organized under the laws of Luxembourg, consummated consent solicitations and exchange offers related to certain series of debt issued under our 1998 and 2003 indentures. In connection with the exchange offers, we issued $422 million principal amount of 7.0% notes due 2019 in exchange for an equal principal amount of 7.0% notes due 2028 and $707 million principal amount of 6.875% notes due 2021 in exchange for an equal principal amount of 6.875% notes due 2029. In connection with the consent solicitations, holders of our 6.0% notes due 2013, 6.125% notes due 2008, 6.125% notes due 2009, 6.75% notes due 2011, 6.375% notes due 2011, 7.0% notes due 2028 and 6.875% notes due 2029 collectively received consent payments totaling $250 million. The terms of the consent and exchange offers were evaluated as a debt modification in accordance with the authoritative guidance for debtors accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments, and it was determined that the 7.0% notes due 2028 and the 6.875% notes due 2029 were extinguished because the cash flows of the new bonds as compared to the original bonds were substantially modified. As a result, the new bonds and the 7.0% notes due 2028 and the 6.875% notes due 2029 that were not tendered for exchange were recorded at their fair value upon completion of the exchange offers. In determining fair value, we measured the bonds as if they were an initial issuance to the public. This was done by obtaining effective yield data derived from comparable pricing received from the issuance of bonds with similar ratings and covenants by large public companies. During the year ended September 26, 2008, in connection with the consent solicitations and exchange offers, we recorded a $222 million charge to other expense, net as a loss on extinguishment of debt. This charge was comprised of the consent payments related to the extinguished bonds (notes due 2028 and 2029), premium on the exchanged bonds which represents the difference between the fair value and the book value of the extinguished bonds, and the write off of the original unamortized debt issuance costs, as well as fees paid to third parties associated with the bonds that were not deemed extinguished. The remaining portion of the consent payment and issuance costs will be amortized over the remaining life of the bonds. During the year ended September 28, 2007, we recorded a $259 million charge to other expense, net for the loss on early extinguishment of debt related to the debt tender offers in connection with the Separation. Bank and Revolving Credit Facilities On June 24, 2008, Tyco and TIFSA entered into a $500 million senior unsecured revolving credit agreement with Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent for the lenders party thereto. This credit agreement has a three year term. Borrowings under this agreement have a variable interest rate based on LIBOR or an alternate base rate. The margin over LIBOR can vary based on changes in our credit rating and facility utilization. Together with our $1.19 billion five year senior revolving credit agreement, dated as of April 25, 2007, our total committed revolving credit line was $1.69 billion as of September 25, 2009. These revolving credit facilities may be used for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes. As of September 25, 2009, there were no amounts drawn under these facilities, although we had dedicated $200 million of availability to backstop outstanding commercial paper. As discussed above, we believe that all of the lenders under our revolving credit facility are capable of meeting any borrowing requests TIFSA may make. TIFSAs bank credit agreements contain customary terms and conditions, and financial covenants that limit the ratio of our debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and that limit our ability to incur subsidiary debt or grant liens on our property. Our indentures contain 57 Table of Contents customary covenants including limits on negative pledges, subsidiary debt and sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are considered restrictive to our business. The following tables detail our long term and short term debt ratings as of September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008: Long Term Debt Ratings 2009 2008 Moodys Baa1 Baa1 Standard & Poors BBB+ BBB+ Fitch BBB+ BBB+ Short Term Debt Ratings 2009 2008 Moodys P 2 P 2 Standard & Poors A 2 A 2 Fitch F2 F2 The security ratings set forth above are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.  Commitments and Contingencies Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations and commitments for principal debt, minimum lease payment obligations under non cancelable operating leases and other obligations as of September 25, 2009 is as follows ($ in millions): 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total Debt(1) $ 227 $ 516 $ 850 $ $ 656 $ 1,913 $ 4,162 Interest payments(2) 273 255 211 184 164 801 1,888 Capital leases(3) 18 24 3 4 4 38 91 Operating leases 253 203 147 89 51 123 866 Purchase obligations(4) 90 5 3 98 Total contractual cash obligations(5)(6) $ 861 $ 1,003 $ 1,214 $ 277 $ 875 $ 2,875 $ 7,105 (1)Excludes debt discount and swap activity. (2)Interest payments consist of interest on our fixed interest rate debt and exclude the impact of our interest rate swaps. (3)Excludes interest. (4)Purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of good and services. (5)Other long term liabilities primarily consist of the following: pension and postretirement costs, income taxes, warranties and environmental liabilities and are excluded from this table. We are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type. The minimum required contributions to our pension plans are expected to be approximately $80 million in 2010 and we expect to pay $7 million in 2010 related to postretirement benefit plans. (6)As of September 25, 2009, we recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $284 million and gross interest and penalties of $50 million, both of which are classified as non current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as payment is not expected within one year. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing for such payments in future years; therefore, such amounts have been excluded from the above contractual obligation table. 58 Table of Contents As discussed above, as of September 25, 2009, we had total commitments of $1.69 billion under our revolving credit facilities, $500 million of which matures on June 24, 2011 and $1.19 billion of which matures on April 25, 2012. As of September 25, 2009, there were no amounts drawn under our revolving credit facilities. As of September 25, 2009, the aggregate available commitment under our senior revolving credit facilities was $1.69 billion, $200 million of which was dedicated to backstop all of our commercial paper outstanding as of such date. In May 2008, TIFSA commenced issuing commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes. As of September 25, 2009, TIFSA had $200 million of commercial paper outstanding which bore interest at an average rate of 0.33%. As of September 25, 2009, we classified the outstanding commercial paper balance of $200 million as short term as we intend to repay such amount during the next twelve months. As of September 26, 2008, we classified $116 million of short term commercial paper as long term as settlement of the amount outstanding was not expected to require the use of working capital in the next twelve months as we had both the intent and the ability to refinance this debt on a long term basis. As of September 25, 2009, we had total outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees of $659 million. In the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In connection with the Separation, we entered into a liability sharing agreement regarding certain actions that were pending against Tyco prior to the Separation. Under the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, we have assumed 27%, Covidien has assumed 42% and Tyco Electronics has assumed 31% of certain Tyco pre Separation contingent and other corporate liabilities, which include certain outstanding legacy and tax contingencies and any actions with respect to the spin offs or the distributions made or brought by any third party. Any amounts relating to these contingent and other corporate liabilities paid by Tyco after the spin offs that are subject to the allocation provisions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement or Tax Sharing Agreement will be shared among Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics pursuant to the same allocation ratio. Legal Matters Class Action and Legacy Securities Matters For a discussion of contingencies related to Tycos legacy securities litigation and various legal matters, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Class Action Settlement and Legacy Securities Matters. Adverse outcomes in certain actions to which we are a party could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Environmental Matters Tyco is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos environmental matters, see Item 1. Business Environmental Matters and Item 3. Legal Proceedings Environmental Matters. Asbestos Matters Tyco and certain of its subsidiaries are named as defendants in bodily injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials. For a detailed discussion of Tycos contingencies related to asbestos related matters, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 59 Table of Contents Income Taxes Tyco and its subsidiaries income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. The Company is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest have been assessed as uncertain income tax positions and recorded as appropriate. For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos income taxes, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Compliance Matters Tyco has received and responded to various allegations and other information that improper activities were conducted by Tyco employees in recent years, in particular with respect to DOJ and SEC investigations that have resulted in our performing a Company wide baseline review of our policies, controls and practices as they relate to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. For a detailed discussion of these contingencies and others related to Tycos compliance efforts, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Compliance Matters. Other Matters The Company is a defendant in a number of other pending legal proceedings incidental to present and former operations, acquisitions and dispositions. The Company does not expect the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Backlog As of September 25, 2009, we had a backlog of unfilled orders of $9.0 billion, compared to a backlog of $9.6 billion as of September 26, 2008. We expect that approximately 86% of our backlog as of September 25, 2009 will be filled during 2010. Backlog by segment as of September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008 is as follows ($ in millions): 2009 2008 ADT Worldwide $ 5,908 $ 5,917 Flow Control 1,698 2,083 Fire Protection Services 1,169 1,314 Electrical and Metal Products 72 117 Safety Products 114 154 $ 8,961 $ 9,585 Backlog decreased by $624 million, or 6.5%, from $9.6 billion as of September 26, 2008 to $9.0 billion as of September 25, 2009. Unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a decrease of $87 million. ADT Worldwides backlog decreased by $9 million, or 0.2%, as of September 25, 2009. The decrease was primarily due to unfavorable exchange rates of $83 million partially offset by an increase in net bookings of $74 million. ADT Worldwides total account base grew 2.9% during 2009 to 7.4 million accounts. The amount of recurring revenue in force as of September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008 was $4.0 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. The increase in recurring revenue in force was primarily the result of the increase in the account base discussed above partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Recurring revenue in force represents 12 months fees for monitoring and maintenance services under contract in the security business. Flow Controls backlog decreased by $385 million primarily due to decreased bookings of $398 million offset by favorable exchange rates of $13 million. Fire Protection Services 60 Table of Contents backlog decreased by $145 million primarily due to unfavorable exchange rates of $15 million and decreased bookings of $130 million.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale of Accounts Receivable Certain of Tycos international businesses utilize the sale of accounts receivable as short term financing mechanisms. The aggregate amount outstanding under the Companys remaining international accounts receivable programs was $55 million, $65 million and $76 million as of September 25, 2009, September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007, respectively. Guarantees Certain of our business segments have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from 2009 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would typically be triggered in the event of nonperformance and performance under the guarantees, if required, would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. There are certain guarantees or indemnifications extended among Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics in accordance with the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Tax Sharing Agreement. The guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the Tax Sharing Agreement. At the time of the Separation, we recorded a liability necessary to recognize the fair value of such guarantees and indemnifications. In the absence of observable transactions for identical or similar guarantees, we determined the fair value of these guarantees and indemnifications utilizing expected present value measurement techniques. Significant assumptions utilized to determine fair value included determining a range of potential outcomes, assigning a probability weighting to each potential outcome and estimating the anticipated timing of resolution. The probability weighted outcomes were discounted using our incremental borrowing rate. The liability necessary to reflect the fair value of the guarantees and indemnifications under the Tax Sharing Agreement is $554 million, which is included in other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008. The guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the Tax Sharing Agreement. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Tax Sharing Agreement. In addition, we historically provided support in the form of financial and or performance guarantees to various Covidien and Tyco Electronics operating entities. In connection with the Separation, we worked with the guarantee counterparties to cancel or assign these guarantees to Covidien or Tyco Electronics. To the extent these guarantees were not assigned prior to the Separation date, we assumed primary liability on any remaining such support. The estimated fair value of these obligations is $4 million and $7 million, which are included in other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008, respectively, with an offset to shareholders equity on the Separation date. In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business Environmental Matters and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these liabilities. 61 Table of Contents In the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As of September 25, 2009, we had total outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees of $659 million. We record estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. For further information on estimated product warranty, see Notes 1 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2001, a division of Safety Products initiated a Voluntary Replacement Program ("VRP") associated with the acquisition of Central Sprinkler. The VRP relates to the replacement of certain O ring seal sprinkler heads which were originally manufactured by Central Sprinkler prior to Tycos acquisition. Under this program, the sprinkler heads are being replaced free of charge to property owners. On May 1, 2007, we, along with the Consumer Products Safety Commission announced an August 31, 2007 deadline for filing claims to participate in the VRP. We will fulfill all valid claims for replacement of qualifying sprinklers received up to August 31, 2007. Settlements during 2009, 2008 and 2007 include cash expenditures of $33 million, $49 million and $38 million, respectively, related to the VRP. The Company believes the remaining liability represents our best estimate of the cost required to complete the VRP as of September 25, 2009, which is not material. 62  Table of Contents  Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued authoritative guidance which established the FASB Standards Accounting Codification ("Codification") as the source of authoritative GAAP recognized by the FASB to be applied to nongovernmental entities, and rules and interpretive releases of the SEC as authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. The Codification supersedes all the existing non SEC accounting and reporting standards upon its effective date and, subsequently, the FASB will not issue new standards in the form of Statements, FASB Staff Positions or Emerging Issues Task Force Abstracts. The guidance is not intended to change or alter existing GAAP. The guidance became effective for Tyco in the fourth quarter of 2009. The guidance did not have an impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. All references to previous numbering of FASB Statements, FASB Staff Positions or Emerging Issues Task Force Abstracts have been removed from the financial statements and accompanying footnotes. In May 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for subsequent events. The guidance provides authoritative accounting literature related to evaluating subsequent events that was previously addressed only in the auditing literature. The guidance is similar to the current guidance with some exceptions that are not intended to result in significant change to current practice. The guidance defines subsequent events and also requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date. The Company adopted the disclosure provisions of the guidance as of June 26, 2009. The adoption did not have an impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In April 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments, which amended existing guidance. The guidance requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim financial statements as well as in annual financial statements. The Company adopted the disclosure provisions of the guidance as of June 26, 2009. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the adoption of the guidance. The adoption did not have an impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In March 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities. The guidance is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entitys results of operations. The Company adopted the disclosure provisions of the guidance as of December 27, 2008. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the adoption of the guidance. The adoption did not have an impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In February 2007, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities. The guidance permits an entity, on a contract by contract basis, to make an irrevocable election to account for certain types of financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value, rather than historical cost, with changes in the fair value, whether realized or unrealized, recognized in earnings. The guidance became effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2009 at which time the Company did not elect the fair value option for eligible items. In September 2006, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for fair value measurements, which enhances existing guidance for measuring assets and liabilities at fair value. The guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which permits companies to partially defer the effective date of the guidance for one year for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. During the first quarter of 2009 the Company elected to defer the adoption of the guidance for one year for non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis which is effective for Tyco in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, on a 63 Table of Contents prospective basis. The guidance became effective for Tyco in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 for financial assets and liabilities only. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the adoption of the guidance. In September 2006, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. The guidance requires that employers recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as a net asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognize as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, net of income taxes, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. The Company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of the guidance as of September 28, 2007. The guidance also requires companies to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of their fiscal year end. The Company adopted the measurement date provisions of the guidance on September 27, 2008. As a result, Tyco measured its plan assets and benefit obligations on September 26, 2008 and adjusted its opening balances of accumulated (deficit) earnings and accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income for the change in net periodic benefit cost and fair value, respectively, from the previously used measurement date of August 31, 2008. The adoption of the measurement date provisions resulted in a net decrease to accumulated (deficit) earnings of $5 million, net of an income tax benefit of $2 million, and a net increase to accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income of $61 million, net of income taxes of $28 million for 2009. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the adoption of the guidance. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In September 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for the accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. The guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable. The selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence if available, third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available, or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific evidence nor third party evidence is available. The guidance requires arrangements under which multiple revenue generating activities to be performed be allocated at inception. The residual method under the existing accounting guidance has been eliminated. The guidance expands the disclosure requirements related to multiple deliverable revenue arrangements. The guidance becomes effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified beginning in fiscal 2011, with early adoption permitted. The guidance applies on a prospective basis unless the Company specifically elects to apply the guidance retrospectively. The Company is currently assessing what impact, if any, the guidance will have on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows, as well as the timing of its adoption of the guidance. In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which amended the existing guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities, to address the elimination of the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity. The guidance also replaces the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity, and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity. Additionally, the guidance requires any enterprise that holds a variable interest in a variable interest entity to provide enhanced disclosures that will provide users of financial statements with more transparent information about an enterprises involvement in a variable interest entity. The guidance is effective for Tyco in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. The Company is currently assessing what impact, if any, that the guidance will have on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets. The guidance requires additional disclosures about plan assets related to an employers defined benefit pension or other post retirement plans to enable investors to 64 Table of Contents better understand how investment decisions are made, the major categories of plan assets, the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets, the effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) on changes in plan assets for the period, and the significant concentrations of risk within plan assets. The disclosure provisions of the guidance are effective for Tyco in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. In June 2008, the FASB ratified authoritative guidance for determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities. The guidance addresses whether instruments granted in share based payment awards are participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, must be included in the earnings allocation in calculating earnings per share under the two class method. The guidance requires that unvested share based payment awards that contain non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents be treated as participating securities in calculating earnings per share. The guidance is effective for Tyco starting with the first quarter of fiscal 2010, and shall be applied retrospectively to all prior periods. The Company believes that the guidance will not have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In April 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for determining the useful life of intangible assets. The guidance amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset. The guidance is effective for Tyco in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The Company has determined that the guidance will not have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB revised the authoritative guidance for business combinations. The revised guidance retains the underlying concepts of the existing guidance in that business combinations are still accounted for at fair value. However, the accounting for certain other aspects of business combinations will be affected. Acquisition costs will generally be expensed as incurred. Restructuring costs associated with a business combination will generally be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date. In process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible at the acquisition date until it is completed or abandoned and its useful life can be determined. Changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions after the acquisition date will generally impact income tax expense. The revised guidance also expands required disclosures surrounding the nature and financial effects of business combinations. The revised guidance is effective, on a prospective basis, for Tyco in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. In December 2007, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements. The guidance requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest (minority interest prior to the adoption of the guidance) as equity in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest should be included in consolidated net income on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The guidance also amends certain existing consolidation procedures in order to achieve consistency with the requirements of the revised authoritative guidance for business combinations discussed above. The guidance also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest. This guidance is effective for Tyco in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The implementation of the guidance will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  Forward Looking Information Certain statements in this report are "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. All statements contained herein that are not clearly historical in nature are forward looking, and the words "anticipate," "believe," "expect," "estimate," "project" and similar expressions are generally intended to identify forward looking statements. Any forward looking statement contained herein, in press releases, written statements or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), or in Tycos communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the 65 Table of Contents normal course of business through meetings, web casts, phone calls and conference calls, regarding expectations with respect to sales, earnings, cash flows, operating efficiencies, product expansion, backlog, the consummation and benefits of acquisitions and divestitures, as well as financings and repurchases of debt or equity securities, are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and contingencies. Many of these risks, uncertainties and contingencies are beyond our control, and may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from anticipated results, performance or achievements. Factors that might affect such forward looking statements include, among other things: overall economic and business conditions; the demand for Tycos goods and services; competitive factors in the industries in which Tyco competes; changes in tax requirements (including tax rate changes, new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations); results and consequences of Tycos internal investigation and governmental investigations concerning the Companys governance, management, internal controls and operations including its business operations outside the United States; the outcome of litigation and governmental proceedings; effect of income tax audit settlements; our ability to repay or refinance our outstanding indebtedness as it matures; our ability to operate within the limitations imposed by financing arrangements and to maintain our credit ratings; interest rate fluctuations and other changes in borrowing costs; other capital market conditions, including availability of funding sources and currency exchange rate fluctuations; availability of and fluctuations in the prices of key raw materials, including steel and copper; economic and political conditions in international markets, including governmental changes and restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders; the ability to achieve cost savings in connection with the Companys strategic restructuring and Six Sigma initiatives and our ability to execute our portfolio refinement and acquisition strategies; potential further impairment of our goodwill and or our long lived assets; the impact of fluctuations in the price of Tyco common shares; risks associated with the change in our jurisdiction of incorporation from Bermuda to Switzerland, including the possibility of reduced flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management, increased or different regulatory burdens, and the possibility that we may not realize anticipated tax benefits; changes in U.S. and non U.S. governmental laws and regulations; and the possible effects on Tyco of future legislation in the United States that may limit or eliminate potential U.S. tax benefits resulting from Tycos jurisdiction of incorporation or deny U.S. government contracts to Tyco based upon its jurisdiction of incorporation.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of conducting business, we are exposed to certain risks associated with potential changes in market conditions. These risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Accordingly, we have established a comprehensive risk 66 Table of Contents management process to monitor, evaluate and manage the principal exposures we believe we are subject to. We seek to manage these risks through the use of financial derivative instruments. Our portfolio of derivative financial instruments may, from time to time, include forward foreign currency exchange contracts, foreign currency options, interest rate swaps and forward commodity contracts. Derivative financial instruments related to interest rate sensitivity of debt obligations, intercompany cross border transactions and anticipated non functional currency cash flows are used with the goal of mitigating a significant portion of these exposures when it is cost effective to do so. We do not execute transactions or utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, to reduce the risk that a counterparty will be unable to honor its contractual obligations to us, we only enter into contracts with counterparties having at least an A /A3 long term debt rating. These counterparties are generally financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one party. Foreign Currency Exposures We hedge our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates through the use of forward foreign currency exchange contracts. During 2009, our largest exposures to foreign exchange rates existed primarily with the Swiss franc, British pound, Euro, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. The market risk related to the forward foreign currency exchange contracts (excluding the dividend hedge contract discussed below) is measured by estimating the potential impact of a 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates. The rates used to perform this analysis were based on the market rates in effect on September 25, 2009. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in a $6 million net increase in the fair value of the contracts. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in a $7 million net decrease in the fair value of the contracts. However, gains or losses on these derivative instruments are economically offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. Effective March 17, 2009, Tyco changed its jurisdiction of incorporation from Bermuda to Switzerland. Until January 1, 2011 Tyco intends to make dividend payments in the form of a reduction of capital denominated in Swiss francs. However, the Company expects to actually pay dividends in U.S. dollars, based on exchange rates in effect shortly before the payment date. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to the Swiss franc between the date the dividend is declared and paid will increase or decrease the U.S. dollar amount required to be paid. The Company manages the potential variability in cash flows associated with the dividend payments by entering into derivative financial instruments used as economic hedges of the underlying risk. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Swiss franc would result in a $20 million net decrease in the fair value of the contracts. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Swiss franc would result in a $24 million net increase in the fair value of the contracts. However, gains or losses on these derivative instruments are economically offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. Previously, we hedged our investment in certain foreign operations. In December 2006, due to required changes to the legal entity structure to facilitate the Separation, the Company determined that it would no longer consider certain intercompany foreign currency transactions to be long term investments. As a result, the related foreign currency transaction gains and losses on such investments were recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations subsequent to this determination rather than in the currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income within shareholders equity. Forward contracts that were previously designated as hedges of these net investments continued to be used to manage this exposure but were no longer designated as net investment hedges. During fiscal 2009, we designated certain intercompany loans as permanent in nature. As of September 25, 2009, $3.0 billion of intercompany loans have been designated as permanent in nature and for the year ended September 25, 2009, we recorded the cumulative translation loss through 67 Table of Contents accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income related to these loans, which had no material impact for fiscal 2009 and $141 million for fiscal 2008. Interest Rate Exposures Our long term debt portfolio primarily consists of fixed rate instruments. The Company manages its interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swap transactions with financial institutions acting as principal counterparties, which were designated as fair value hedges for accounting purposes. During 2009, the Company entered into the interest rate swap transactions with the objective of managing the exposure to interest rate risk by converting the interest rates on $1.4 billion of fixed rate debt to variable rates. In these contracts, the Company agreed with financial institutions acting as principal counterparties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated on an agreed upon notional principal amount. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates as of September 25, 2009 would result in a $22 million net decrease in the fair value of the contracts. Conversely, a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates as of September 25, 2009 would result in a $22 million net increase in the fair value of the contracts. Commodity Exposures We are exposed to volatility in the prices of raw materials used in some of our products and may, in limited circumstances, enter into hedging contracts to manage those exposures. These exposures are monitored as an integral part of our risk management program. During 2009, the Company did not hedge its exposure attributable to changes in commodity prices but may consider such strategies in the future.
