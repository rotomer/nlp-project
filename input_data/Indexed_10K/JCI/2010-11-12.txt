Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the Companys financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the Selected Financial Data and our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The Company does not believe that its historical operating results will be indicative of future operating results. This discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The Companys actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those under the headings "Risk Factors" and "Forward Looking Information." Introduction The Consolidated Financial Statements include the consolidated results of Tyco International Ltd., a company organized under the laws of Switzerland, and its subsidiaries (hereinafter collectively referred to as "we," the "Company" or "Tyco"). The financial statements have been prepared in United States dollars ("USD"), in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Company operates in the following business segments: ADT Worldwide designs, sells, installs, services and monitors electronic security systems for residential, commercial, industrial and governmental customers. In addition, ADT Worldwide manufactures certain products related to retailer anti theft systems. Flow Control designs, manufactures, sells and services valves, pipes, fittings, valve automation and heat tracing products for general process, energy and mining markets as well as the water and wastewater markets. Fire Protection Services designs, sells, installs and services fire detection and fire suppression systems for commercial, industrial and governmental customers. Electrical and Metal Products designs, manufactures and sells galvanized steel tubing, armored wire and cable and other metal products for non residential construction, electrical, fire and safety and mechanical customers. Safety Products designs, manufactures and sells fire suppression, electronic security and life safety products, including fire sprinklers, breathing apparatus, intrusion, security, access control and video management systems. In addition, Safety Products manufactures products installed and serviced by ADT Worldwide and Fire Protection Services. We also provide general corporate services to our segments and these costs are reported as Corporate and Other. References to the segment data are to the Companys continuing operations. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. The Company has reclassified certain businesses which have satisfied the criteria to be presented as discontinued operations to income from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and assets and liabilities held for sale within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, the Company has realigned certain business operations during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 resulting in prior period segment amounts being recast. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. On May 14, 2010, we acquired all of the outstanding equity of Brinks Home Security Holdings, Inc. ("BHS" or "Broadview Security") in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately 34 Table of Contents $2.0 billion, with $585 million in cash being used to fund the acquisition. Broadview Security is being integrated into the Companys ADT Worldwide segment. Broadview Securitys core business is to provide security alarm monitoring services for residential and commercial properties in North America. It has a large residential recurring customer base, which has enhanced ADTs presence in the North American residential security business. Broadview Security is also a leader in technologies and services which are expected to enhance ADT Worldwides service offerings to its customers. In connection with the integration of Broadview Security into the ADT Worldwide segment, the Broadview Security brand has been discontinued, and we expect to realize cost savings and other synergies through operational efficiencies including consolidation of both marketing and general and administrative functions. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we initiated a program to fully integrate Broadview Security into our ADT Worldwide segment. We anticipate that Broadview Security will be fully integrated into our ADT Worldwide segments North America business during the first half of 2011. As a result, Broadview Securitys operating results, including its revenue and income from continuing operations, will be reflected in the operating results of our ADT North America business and will no longer be reported separately. Due to the integration of operations, we have estimated that Broadview Security contributed approximately $193 million to our consolidated net revenue and a loss from continuing operations of $25 million during 2010. We incurred approximately $17 million of costs directly related to the acquisition and $18 million of integration costs for a total of $35 million during 2010. Of this amount, $32 million has been recorded in our ADT Worldwide segment and $3 million in Corporate and Other. Both acquisition and integration costs have been recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Operations during 2010. In addition, our ADT Worldwide segment recorded $14 million of restructuring expenses related to combining the Broadview Security and ADT Worldwide businesses, which have been recorded within restructuring, asset impairments and divestiture charges, net in our Consolidated Statement of Operations during 2010. Also, during the third quarter of 2010, we announced our intention to pursue a tax free spin off of our Electrical and Metal Products business. On November 9, 2010, we announced an agreement to sell a 51% interest in our Electrical and Metal Products business. In connection with this announcement, we no longer plan to pursue the tax free spin off of our Electrical and Metal Products business as proposed on April 27, 2010. See Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Overview Net revenue for 2010 increased $134 million, or 0.8%, as compared to 2009. The increase was primarily driven by the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $624 million, or 3.7%. This increase was partially offset by net revenue declines experienced in our Flow Control and Fire Protection Services segments. Flow Controls decline in net revenue was primarily the result of reduced volume in its valves business driven by decreased demand in our end markets. Weakness in the commercial end market resulted in a decline in product and systems installation revenue within our Fire Protection Services segment. Service revenue continued to grow as a percentage of our overall revenue to 41% for 2010 as compared to 40% and 36% for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our service revenues are principally derived from our ADT Worldwide and Fire Protection Services businesses, and represent a predictable and consistent source of revenue. Recurring revenue in our ADT Worldwide business represents approximately 58% of ADTs total revenue compared to approximately 54% in 2009 and 51% in 2008. Recurring revenue represents revenue associated with monitoring and maintenance services under contractual arrangements. In the Fire Protection Services business, service revenue continued to increase as a percentage of Fire Protections total revenue to 52% in 2010, as compared to 49% and 48% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Net revenue was also favorably impacted by approximately 35 Table of Contents $69 million, or 0.4%, for net acquisitions and divestitures, which primarily related to the acquisition of Broadview Security partially offset by the sale of our French security business. Operating income during 2010 was $1.6 billion, compared to an operating loss of $1.5 billion during 2009. Operating income in 2009 was negatively affected by goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of approximately $2.7 billion and legacy legal settlement charges of approximately $125 million during 2009. Operating income in 2010 was favorably impacted by efficiencies gained from cost containment actions taken in fiscal 2010 and 2009 and restructuring actions taken in prior years. Restructuring and asset impairment charges decreased to $145 million during 2010 from $232 million during 2009. Operating income during 2010 was favorably impacted by net gains on divestitures of $40 million as compared to a loss on divestitures of $15 million during 2009. We also incurred acquisition and integration charges of $35 million during 2010 related to our acquisition of Broadview Security. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted operating income by $80 million during 2010. As of September 24, 2010, our cash balance was $1.8 billion, as compared to $2.4 billion as of September 25, 2009. We generated approximately $2.6 billion of cash from operating activities, which was more than offset by: $600 million of cash used for acquisitions net of cash acquired, primarily related to our acquisition of Broadview Security; accounts purchased by ADT and capital expenditures of $1.3 billion; approximately $900 million to repurchase our common shares; dividends paid of $416 million; and a net debt repayment of $204 million. We expect to continue to use our cash to fund internal growth opportunities, improve productivity across all of our businesses, make acquisitions that strategically fit within our ADT Worldwide, Fire Protection Services and Flow Control businesses and return capital to shareholders. On September 8, 2010, our Board of Directors approved a new $1.0 billion share repurchase program ("2010 repurchase program") as the remaining capacity under our existing $1.0 billion share repurchase program was substantially utilized by the end of August 2010. We did not repurchase any shares under the new program during 2010. In 2010, we also continued our portfolio refinement efforts by exiting areas that have not provided, and are not expected to provide, an adequate return on investment and by taking advantage of restructuring opportunities that are expected to provide future cost savings. During 2010, we incurred approximately $145 million of restructuring and asset impairment charges, substantially completing our 2009 restructuring program. During fiscal 2010, we identified additional opportunities for cost savings through restructuring activities in fiscal 2011. We expect to incur restructuring and restructuring related charges of approximately $150 million in fiscal 2011. Over the last few years, we have explored alternatives for under performing or non strategic businesses, including divestiture. We sold our French security business, which was part of our ADT Worldwide segment, resulting in a pre tax gain of $53 million during 2010. The gain and results of operations of the French security business are presented in continuing operations as the criteria for discontinued operations have not been met. As discussed above, during the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we announced our intention to sell a 51% interest in our Electrical and Metal Products business. See Notes 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, during the third quarter of fiscal 2010, our Board of Directors approved a plan to sell our European water business, which is part of our Flow Control segment. The business met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and has been included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. On September 30, 2010, we received the necessary consents and approval to complete the sale of this business and received net cash proceeds of approximately $267 million. We expect to recognize a gain on the transaction. 36 Table of Contents Operating Results Net revenue, operating income (loss) and net income (loss) for the years ended September 24, 2010, September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008 were as follows ($ in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Revenue from product sales $ 9,990 $ 10,134 $ 12,602 Service revenue 7,026 6,748 7,131 Net revenue $ 17,016 $ 16,882 $ 19,733 Operating income (loss) $ 1,598 $ (1,506 ) $ 1,896 Interest income 31 44 112 Interest expense (284 ) (301 ) (396 ) Other expense, net (75 ) (7 ) (223 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 1,270 (1,770 ) 1,389 Income tax expense (138 ) (71 ) (326 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations 1,132 (1,841 ) 1,063 Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes 7 47 491 Net income (loss) $ 1,139 $ (1,794 ) $ 1,554 Less: Noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries net income 7 4 1 Net income (loss) attributable to Tyco common shareholders $ 1,132 $ (1,798 ) $ 1,553 Segment Results The segment discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in results for each of our segments included in continuing operations. ADT Worldwide Net revenue, goodwill and intangible asset impairments, operating income (loss) and operating margin for ADT Worldwide for the years ended September 24, 2010, September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008 were as follows ($ in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Revenue from product sales $ 2,388 $ 2,270 $ 2,728 (1) Service revenue 4,988 4,796 5,074 (1) Net revenue $ 7,376 $ 7,066 $ 7,802 Goodwill and intangible asset impairments $ $ 1,023 $ 1 Operating income (loss) 1,056 (202 ) 866 Operating margin 14.3 % (2) 11.1 % (1)As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, revenue related to the sale of electronic tags and labels has been classified as revenue from product sales during fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2009 and 2008, the sale of the electronic tags and labels was misclassified as service revenue. The service revenue and revenue from product sales during fiscal 2009 and 2008 have not been changed for this misclassification, as the effect is not material. The impact of the misclassification for fiscal 2009 would have been to decrease service revenue by $286 million, with corresponding increases to revenue from product sales. The impact of the misclassification for fiscal 2008 would have been to decrease service revenue by $364 million, with corresponding increases to revenue from product sales. (2)Certain operating margins and percentages have not been presented as management believes such calculations are not meaningful. 37 Table of Contents Revenue from product sales includes sales and installation of electronic security and other life safety systems as well as products related to retailer anti theft systems. Service revenue is comprised of electronic security services and maintenance, including the monitoring of burglar alarms, fire alarms and other life safety systems as well as other security services. Net revenue for ADT Worldwide increased $310 million, or 4.4%, during 2010, as compared to 2009. Net revenue was favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $218 million, or 3.1%. Net revenue was also favorably impacted by the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of $72 million, or 1.0%, which was primarily the result of $193 million in net revenue estimated to be contributed by the Broadview Security acquisition partially offset by $109 million of divested revenue relating to our French security business. Approximately 58% and 54% of ADT Worldwides total net revenue during 2010 and 2009, respectively, represents revenue associated with monitoring and maintenance services under contractual arrangements, which is considered recurring revenue. Recurring revenue increased by $435 million, or 11.3%, to approximately $4.3 billion as a result of growth in customer accounts of approximately 1.5 million, or 20.5%, to a total of approximately 8.9 million accounts as of September 24, 2010. Approximately 1.4 million customer accounts were acquired on May 14, 2010 in connection with the Broadview Security acquisition and approximately 501,000 customer accounts were acquired through the ADT dealer program during 2010. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted recurring revenue by $148 million in 2010, or 3.8%, and $116 million, or 3.0%, respectively. Systems installation, product sales and other service revenue declined by $125 million, or 3.9%, to approximately $3.1 billion due to lower sales volume primarily as the result of continued weakness in the commercial end market, which has declined at a slower rate than the same period in the prior year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted systems installation, product sales and other service revenue by $102 million, or 3.2%, while the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures resulted in an unfavorable impact of $76 million, or 2.4%. Net revenue by geographic area for ADT Worldwide for the years ended September 24, 2010, September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008 was as follows ($ in millions): 2010 2009 2008 North America $ 4,436 $ 4,185 $ 4,231 Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") 1,733 1,870 2,398 Rest of World 1,207 1,011 1,173 $ 7,376 $ 7,066 $ 7,802 Geographically, North America net revenue increased $251 million, or 6.0%, during 2010 primarily as the result of the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, which favorably impacted net revenue by an estimated $193 million, or 4.6%, as the result of the acquisition of Broadview Security. Partially offsetting this increase was a decline in systems installation and product sales as the result of continued weakness in the commercial market, although the rate of decline was slower than the same period in the prior year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates also favorably impacted net revenue by $48 million, or 1.1%. Net revenue in EMEA decreased $137 million, or 7.3%, as favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $60 million, or 3.2%, were more than offset by a decline in systems installation and other service revenue as a result of continued weakness in the commercial end market, although the rate of decline was slower than the same period in the prior year. Additionally, EMEA net revenue was unfavorably impacted by $121 million, or 6.5%, due to the impact of divestitures. Net revenue increased $196 million, or 19.4%, in the Rest of World geographies primarily due to recurring revenue growth in both Latin American and Asia Pacific regions as ADT Worldwide continues to focus on building its customer account and recurring revenue base in these markets. The Asia Pacific region experienced an increase in system installation, products sales and other service revenue which was 38 Table of Contents partially offset by a decrease in the Latin American region due to the continued slowdown in commercial and retailer end markets. Net revenue in the Rest of World geographies was also favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $110 million, or 10.9%. Attrition rates decreased during 2010 as compared to 2009 as shown in the following table: For the Fiscal Year Ended September 24, 2010 September 25, 2009 September 26, 2008 Attrition 12.8 % 13.3% (1) 12.9% (1) (1)Attrition rates for the years ended September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008 have been recast to reflect the divestiture of our French security business, which resulted in reductions of 0.1% in the amounts previously reported for September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008, respectively. Operating income increased by approximately $1.3 billion during 2010 as compared to 2009. Operating income for 2009 was negatively affected by goodwill impairment charges of $959 million recorded at our ADT EMEA and Sensormatic Retail Solutions reporting units and intangible asset impairment charges of $64 million. Operating income in 2010 was positively impacted by the shift to higher margin recurring revenue. Additionally, 2010 operating income was favorably impacted by the net impact of savings realized through previous restructuring actions, savings realized through cost containment actions, and a curtailment gain of $12 million recognized when certain defined benefit pension plans were frozen in the United Kingdom. These increases were partially offset by an increase in the amortization of intangible assets primarily relating to the Broadview Security acquisition. During 2010, $60 million of net restructuring charges were incurred, of which $14 million related to restructuring actions associated with the acquisition of Broadview Security, as compared to $103 million of restructuring charges, net during 2009. Fiscal year 2010 also included a $45 million gain on divestitures, net primarily related to the sale of our French security business, and $32 million of acquisition and integration costs related to the acquisition of Broadview Security, as compared to a $6 loss and nil of divestiture and acquisition costs, respectively, during 2009. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted operating income by $30 million. Net revenue for ADT Worldwide decreased $736 million, or 9.4%, during 2009 as compared to 2008. This decrease was primarily driven by the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $614 million. Revenue was positively affected by $152 million for the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Revenue from product sales decreased 16.8% and service revenue decreased 5.5%. Recurring revenue declined 3.5% during 2009 primarily as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which unfavorably impacted recurring revenue by 7.5%, but was offset by growth in North America and Asia. Product sales and installation and other service revenue declined 15.6% partially due to a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which unfavorably impacted system installation and service revenue by 8.3%, and lower sales volume due to weakness in the commercial markets, including the retailer end market. Geographically, revenue in North America decreased $46 million, or 1.1%, resulting from reduced spending primarily in the commercial markets, including the retailer end market. Revenue in EMEA decreased $528 million, or 22.0%, largely as a result of foreign currency exchange rates, which had an unfavorable impact of $328 million. The remaining decrease in EMEA was primarily a result of a decline in product sales, systems installation and service revenue due to a slowdown in the commercial markets, including the retailer end market. Revenue declined $162 million, or 13.8%, in the Rest of World geographies, which was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $223 million partially offset by growth in Asia and Latin America. Operating income in 2009 decreased $1.1 billion as compared to 2008. Based on the deterioration in the commercial markets, including the retailer end market discussed above, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $959 million related to its ADT EMEA reporting unit and intangible 39 Table of Contents asset impairment charges of $64 million related to certain franchise rights within North America during the second quarter of 2009. The decrease is also related to the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $45 million. The decrease was further driven by the decline in sales volume as well as an increase in bad debt charges, both as a result of the weakness experienced in the commercial markets, including the retailer end market, and adverse global economic conditions. Operating income was negatively impacted by restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges of $109 million in 2009. Operating income in 2008 included restructuring charges of $119 million and expenses of $51 million primarily to convert customers from analog to digital signal transmission in North America. There were no charges related to converting customers to digital signal during 2009. The decline in operating income was partially offset by savings realized through cost containment and restructuring actions. Flow Control Net revenue, operating income and operating margin for Flow Control for the years ended September 24, 2010, September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008 were as follows ($ in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Revenue from product sales $ 3,089 $ 3,232 $ 3,740 Service revenue 284 263 212 Net revenue $ 3,373 $ 3,495 $ 3,952 Operating income $ 410 $ 496 $ 574 Operating margin 12.2 % 14.2 % 14.5 % Net revenue for Flow Control decreased $122 million, or 3.5%, during 2010 as compared to 2009. The decrease in net revenue was primarily driven by reduced volume in the valves business driven by decreased demand in our end markets. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net revenue by $218 million, or 6.2%, as well as the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures by $10 million, or 0.3%. The decrease in operating income of $86 million, or 17.3%, during 2010 as compared to 2009, was primarily due to decreased volume in our valves business and an expected loss related to completion of a long term construction project of approximately $18 million. These declines were partially offset by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $31 million, or 6.3%. The decline in operating income was also partially offset by savings realized through cost containment and restructuring actions. Operating income was negatively impacted by $24 million of restructuring and divestiture charges, net during both 2010 and 2009. Additionally, management estimated that $5 million of additional charges resulting from restructuring actions were incurred during 2009. Net revenue for Flow Control decreased $457 million, or 11.6%, during 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease in net revenue was primarily driven by the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $418 million, or 10.6%. Revenue also decreased due to reduced volume in the water business and reduced project activity in the energy end market of the thermal controls business. The decrease in revenue was partially offset by an increase in the valves business primarily from the energy end market in EMEA. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures unfavorably impacted net revenue by $3 million in 2009 and favorably impacted net revenue by $16 million in 2008. Operating income decreased $78 million, or 13.6%, during 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $71 million as well as decreased volume in the water businesses discussed above offset by margin improvements in the valves business. Margins were also negatively impacted by restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges of $24 million. Additionally, management 40 Table of Contents estimates that $5 million of additional charges resulting from restructuring actions were incurred during 2009. Restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges were $6 million in 2008. Additionally, selling, general and administrative expenses during 2008 included an environmental remediation charge of $6 million related to the closure of a facility in North America. The decline in operating income was partially offset by savings realized through cost containment and restructuring actions. Fire Protection Services Net revenue, goodwill impairment, operating income and operating margin for Fire Protection Services for the years ended September 24, 2010, September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008 were as follows ($ in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Revenue from product sales $ 1,615 $ 1,734 $ 1,989 Service revenue 1,740 1,676 1,824 Net Revenue $ 3,355 $ 3,410 $ 3,813 Goodwill impairment $ $ 180 $ 9 Operating income 272 70 333 Operating margin 8.1 % (1) 8.7 % (1)Certain operating margins and percentage changes have not been presented as management believes such calculations are not meaningful. Revenue from product sales includes sales and installation of fire protection and other systems. Service revenue consists of inspection, maintenance, service and monitoring of fire detection and suppression systems. Net revenue by geographic area for Fire Protection Services was as follows ($ in millions): 2010 2009 2008 North America $ 1,940 $ 1,994 $ 2,111 International 1,415 1,416 1,702 Net revenue $ 3,355 $ 3,410 $ 3,813 Net revenue for Fire Protection Services decreased $55 million, or 1.6%, during 2010 compared to 2009. This decrease was primarily due to continued weakness in commercial markets and a shift from lower margin projects to higher projects, which more than offset the favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $118 million, or 3.5%. Geographically, net revenue in North America decreased $54 million, or 2.7%, primarily due to the continued decline in systems installation and upgrade activity in the sprinkler business. Reduced systems installation and upgrade activity in the electronic business as well as service revenue in the sprinkler and suppression businesses also contributed to the decrease, although to a much lesser extent. These declines were partially offset by an increase in service revenue in the electronic business. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted revenue in North America by $28 million, or 1.4%. Although net revenue in our international fire businesses decreased by $1 million, changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net revenue by $90 million, or 6.4%, which was almost entirely offset by a decrease in revenue due to continued weakness in the European commercial markets. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures unfavorably impacted revenue by $6 million, or 0.2%. Operating income increased $202 million during 2010 as compared to 2009. Operating income during 2009 was negatively affected by a goodwill impairment charge of $180 million recorded at the EMEA Fire reporting unit. Additionally, operating income in 2010 was favorably impacted by savings 41 Table of Contents realized through cost containment actions, and to a lesser extent, a curtailment gain of approximately $7 million recognized when certain defined benefit pension plans were frozen in the United Kingdom. During 2010, $34 million of restructuring and divestiture charges, net were incurred as compared to $45 million of restructuring charges during 2009. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted operating income by $11 million. The net increase in operating income was partially offset by the decreased sales volume discussed above. Net revenue for Fire Protection Services decreased $403 million, or 10.6%, during 2009 as compared to 2008. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $293 million, or 7.7%. Additionally, revenue declined due to the weakness in the commercial market and adverse global economic conditions. Geographically, revenue in our international fire businesses decreased by $286 million, or 16.8%, largely due to the impact of unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates discussed above as well as weakness in the European commercial markets. Additionally, revenue in our North America SimplexGrinnell business decreased by $117 million, 5.5%, primarily due to a decline in systems installation and upgrade activity in the sprinkler business. Operating income decreased $263 million during 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease was primarily due to a $180 million goodwill impairment in EMEA recorded during 2009 compared to a $9 million goodwill impairment in Latin America recorded during 2008. The decrease was further driven by the decline in sales volume discussed above as well as an increase in bad debt charges, both as a result of the weakness experienced in the commercial markets and adverse global economic conditions. There were restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges of $45 million in 2009 as compared to $26 million in 2008. Additionally, operating income decreased due to the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $10 million. The decline in operating income was partially offset by savings realized through cost containment and restructuring actions. Electrical and Metal Products Net revenue, goodwill impairment, operating income (loss) and operating margin for Electrical and Metal Products for the years ended September 24, 2010, September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008 were as follows ($ in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Revenue from product sales $ 1,394 $ 1,389 2,266 Service revenue 5 3 6 Net Revenue $ 1,399 $ 1,392 2,272 Goodwill impairment $ $ 935 $ Operating income (loss) 100 (938 ) 342 Operating margin 7.1 % (1) 15.1 % (1)Certain operating margins and percentage changes have not been presented as management believes such calculations are not meaningful. Net revenue for Electrical and Metal Products increased $7 million, or 0.5%, during 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in revenue was primarily due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $37 million, or 2.7%, and $24 million, or 1.7%; due to the favorable net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. These increases were partially offset by a decline in volume of armored cable products and, to a lesser extent, steel products. Higher selling prices for armored cable products were almost entirely offset by lower selling prices for steel products. Operating income increased approximately $1.0 billion during 2010 as compared to 2009. Operating income for 2009 was negatively affected by goodwill impairment charges of $935 million 42 Table of Contents recorded at the Electrical and Metal Products reporting unit. Also contributing to the increase in operating income were higher spreads for steel products resulting from lower raw material costs which more than offset lower selling prices. These increases in operating income were partially offset by lower volumes as well as higher raw material costs which more than offset higher selling prices for armor cable products. During 2010, $13 million of restructuring charges were incurred compared to $21 million of restructuring and divestiture charges during 2009. Additionally, $1 million of additional charges resulting from restructuring actions were incurred during 2009 as compared to no additional charges during 2010. Net revenue for Electrical and Metal Products decreased $880 million, or 38.7%, in 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to lower volume and selling prices of steel products largely resulting from a decline in the commercial market in North America. Lower volume and selling prices for armored cable products also contributed to the decline. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of $52 million, or 2.3%. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures negatively affected revenue by approximately $31 million, or 1.4%. Operating income decreased $1.3 billion in 2009 as compared to 2008. Based on the sales volume decrease as well as the significant decline in the price of steel, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $935 million during the second quarter of 2009. There was no goodwill impairment recorded during 2008. The decrease in operating income also related to volume declines as well as lower spreads for steel products. Spreads for steel products continued to decline as a direct result of higher raw material costs and lower selling prices. Lower restructuring and divestiture charges incurred in 2009 as compared to similar charges incurred in 2008 partially offset the decline in operating income discussed above. Results for 2009 included restructuring and divestiture charges of $21 million as compared to $42 million for 2008. Additionally, management estimates that $1 million of additional charges resulting from restructuring actions were incurred during 2009. Safety Products Net revenue, goodwill impairments, operating income (loss) and operating margin for Safety Products for the years ended September 24, 2010, September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008 were as follows ($ in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Revenue from product sales $ 1,504 $ 1,510 $ 1,880 Service revenue 9 9 9 Net Revenue $ 1,513 $ 1,519 $ 1,889 Goodwill impairments $ $ 567 $ Operating income (loss) $ 221 $ (367 ) $ 301 Operating margin 14.6 % (1) 15.9 % (1)Certain operating margins and percentage changes have not been presented as management believes such calculations are not meaningful. Net revenue for Safety Products decreased $6 million, or 0.4%, during 2010 as compared to 2009. The decrease in net revenue is primarily due to lower volume in our fire suppression business partially offset by higher volume experienced in our electronic security and life safety businesses. The decrease in our fire suppression business was primarily due to reduced spending in the commercial construction market. The increase in our electronic security and life safety businesses was due to higher volume primarily related to the introduction of several new products. Net revenue was favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $33 million, or 2.2%, which was almost entirely offset by the unfavorable impact of divestitures of $31 million, or 2.0%. 43  Table of Contents Operating income increased $588 million during 2010 compared to 2009. Operating income during 2009 was negatively affected by goodwill impairment charges of $567 million recorded at the Access Controls and Video Systems ("ACVS") and Life Safety reporting units. The increase in operating income is attributable to the increased sales volume in the electronic security and life safety businesses and a shift in product mix to higher margin products across all businesses, which was partially offset by the fire suppression sales volume decline discussed above and increased sales and marketing expense. Restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net was $12 million during 2010 as compared to $32 million of restructuring charges during 2009. Additionally, management estimated that $7 million of additional charges resulting from restructuring actions were incurred during 2009 as compared to no additional charges during 2010. Savings realized through cost containment and restructuring actions also contributed to the increase in operating income. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted operating income by $6 million. Net revenue for Safety Products decreased $370 million, or 19.6%, during 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease was primarily related to reduced volume in our fire suppression business, life safety and electronic security businesses, which were impacted by soft economic conditions. The remaining decrease was related to the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $114 million, 6.0%. The decrease in our fire suppression business was primarily due to reduced spending in the commercial construction market. The decrease in the life safety business was primarily due to reduced municipal spending. The electronic security business decrease was primarily due to the slow down in the retail sector, as retail capital projects and new store openings were canceled or delayed. Operating income decreased $668 million in 2009 as compared to 2008. The decline was primarily attributable to goodwill and intangible impairment charges of $567 million recorded during the quarter ended March 27, 2009 as a result of the slowdown in the commercial and retail markets. As discussed above, decreased sales volume within the fire suppression, life safety and electronic security businesses also negatively impacted operating income. Operating income was negatively impacted by restructuring charges of $32 million during 2009. Additionally, management estimates that $7 million of additional charges resulting from restructuring actions were incurred during 2009. The same period in the prior year included $47 million of restructuring and asset impairment charges, net. Operating income in 2009 also decreased by $16 million due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Operating income was also negatively impacted by a charge of $8 million relating to the amount of depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recorded had a business that was previously classified as held for sale been continuously classified as held and used (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Corporate and Other Corporate expense decreased $104 million, or 18.4%, to $461 million for 2010 compared to $565 million in 2009. Corporate expense during 2009 was negatively affected by approximately $125 million of charges related to legacy securities matters partially offset by a $16 million benefit related to a settlement reached with a former executive. Restructuring charges decreased to $1 million for 2010 as compared to $10 million in 2009. Corporate expense was also favorably impacted by savings realized through cost containment and restructuring charges. These decreases in Corporate expenses were partially offset by a $52 million net asbestos charge recorded during the third quarter of 2010 as compared to a $37 million net asbestos charge in 2009, both of which were recorded in conjunction with the valuation of our asbestos related liabilities and insurance assets. In addition, $4 million of divestiture charges, net, and $3 million of acquisition costs were recorded during the 2010 as compared to $6 million of divestiture charges, net, and nil of acquisition costs for 2009. Corporate expense for 2009 was $45 million higher as compared to the prior year, primarily resulting from a charge of approximately $125 million related to the settlement of legacy securities matters, which was partially offset by $16 million benefit related to a settlement reached with a former 44 Table of Contents executive. Additionally, corporate expense in 2009 included $16 million of restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net. Corporate expense for 2008 included net charges of $28 million composed of a $29 million charge for a legacy legal settlement, $4 million of separation costs and $5 million for restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net, offset by a credit of $10 million for class action settlement recoveries. The remaining decrease in corporate expense is primarily related to cost reduction initiatives and the restructuring program. Interest Income and Expense Interest income was $31 million in 2010, as compared to $44 million and $112 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in interest income from 2009 primarily related to lower investment yields. Interest expense was $284 million in 2010, as compared to $301 million and $396 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in interest expense is primarily related to savings from interest rate swaps and no amounts being drawn under the revolving credit facilities in 2010, partially offset by additional interest associated with the January and October 2009 debt issuances. The weighted average interest rate on total debt outstanding as of September 24, 2010, September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008 was 6.3%, 6.6% and 6.2%, respectively. Other Expense, Net Other expense, net of $75 million in 2010 primarily relates to a charge of $87 million as a loss on extinguishment of debt on the redemption of our 6.375% public notes due 2011, 7% notes due 2028 and 6.875% notes due 2029. See Note 11. This loss was partially offset by an $8 million gain recorded as a result of an increase in the receivables due from Covidien and Tyco Electronics under the Tax Sharing Agreement. See Note 6. Other expense, net of $7 million in 2009 primarily relates to a $14 million charge recorded as a result of a decrease in the receivables due from Covidien and Tyco Electronics under the Tax Sharing Agreement, which was partially offset by income of $5 million relating to a gain on derivative contracts used to economically hedge the foreign currency risk related to the Swiss franc denominated dividends. Other expense, net of $223 million in 2008 primarily relates to a charge of $258 million as a loss on extinguishment of debt related to the consent solicitation and exchange offers and termination of the bridge loan facility offset by income of $6 million recorded in connection with the settlement of the 3.125% convertible senior debentures and related financial instruments. We also recorded other than temporary impairments and realized losses on the sale of investments of $6 million related primarily to investments in corporate debt. Additionally, we recorded $40 million of income as a result of an increase in the receivables due from Covidien and Tyco Electronics under the Tax Sharing Agreement in connection with the adoption of the guidance pertaining to the accounting for uncertain income taxes. We also recorded $6 million of expense for other activity in accordance with the Tax Sharing Agreement during 2008. Income Taxes Effective Income Tax Rate Our effective income tax rate was 10.9% for 2010. Our tax rate was favorably impacted by pre tax income in tax jurisdictions with low tax rates. Additionally, the 2010 tax rate was further reduced by limited tax on certain business dispositions, a release of deferred tax valuation allowances and a non recurring item generating a tax benefit. The effective income tax rate for 2009 is not meaningful primarily as a result of the loss driven by goodwill impairment charges of $2.6 billion for which almost no tax benefit was available. Additionally, taxes for 2009 were positively impacted by increased 45 Table of Contents profitability in lower tax rate jurisdictions and release of contingency reserves partially offset by enacted tax law changes and changes in foreign exchange rates that negatively impacted the non U.S. deferred tax assets. Our effective income tax rate was 23.5% for 2008. Income taxes during 2008 were positively impacted by increased profitability in lower tax rate jurisdictions and release of deferred tax valuation allowances partially offset by enacted tax law changes that negatively impacted the non U.S. deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $1,379 million and $766 million as of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. The valuation allowance was calculated and recorded when we determined that it was more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets would not be realized. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as payment is not expected within one year. Other Income Tax Matters In connection with the spin offs of Covidien and Tyco Electronics from Tyco, Tyco entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that governs the rights and obligations of each party with respect to certain pre Separation income tax liabilities. More specifically, Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics share 27%, 42% and 31%, respectively, of shared income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to Tycos, Covidiens and Tyco Electronics U.S. and certain non U.S. income tax returns. Costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are generally shared equally among the parties. Consistent with the sharing provisions of the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco had a net receivable from Covidien and Tyco Electronics of $114 million and $106 million as of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, respectively. In addition, as of September 24, 2010, Tyco had a recorded liability of $554 million (of which $156 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and the remaining amount in other liabilities) representing the fair value of Tycos obligations under the Tax Sharing Agreement as of the date of the Separation. The liability was $554 million as of September 25, 2009, which was recorded in other liabilities. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we reclassified $156 million from other liabilities to accrued and other current liabilities as we expect to make a payment within the next twelve months to Covidien and Tyco Electronics related to resolution of certain IRS audit matters. Tyco and its subsidiaries income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. The Company is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest have been assessed as uncertain income tax positions and recorded as appropriate. For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos income taxes, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 46 Table of Contents 2009 Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairments Annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, and more frequently if triggering events occur, we test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible assets with its carrying amount. We began to experience a decline in revenue during the first quarter of 2009 in our ADT Worldwide, Fire Protection Services and Safety Products segments as a result of a slowdown in the commercial markets, including the retailer end market as well as a decline in sales volume at our Electrical Metal Products segments. Although we considered and concluded that these factors did not constitute triggering events during the first quarter of 2009, the continued existence of these conditions during the second quarter of 2009, along with downward revisions to forecasted results, restructuring actions and weaker industry outlooks, caused us to conclude that sufficient indicators of impairment existed. Reporting units within ADT Worldwide, Fire Protection Services and Safety Products segments continued to be negatively impacted as a result of a slowdown in the commercial markets including the retailer end market. Additionally, our Electrical Metal Products reporting unit continued to be negatively impacted by a decline in sales volume due to the downturn in the non residential construction market. We determined that these underlying events and circumstances constituted triggering events for six reporting units where such events would more likely than not reduce the fair value below their respective carrying amounts. Specifically, we concluded that our EMEA Security and EMEA Fire reporting units within the ADT Worldwide and Fire Protection Services segments, our Electrical and Metal Products reporting unit within the Electrical and Metal Products segment and our ACVS, Life Safety and Sensormatic Retail Solutions ("SRS") reporting units within the Safety Products segment experienced triggering events such that the carrying values of these reporting units likely exceeded their fair values. Furthermore, we determined that certain indefinite lived intangible assets required impairment testing based on the underlying events and circumstances described as well as the continued deterioration of the business environment related to the retailer end market of our ADT Worldwide and Safety Products segments. As a result of the triggering events, we performed long lived asset, goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests for these reporting units and certain of our trade names and franchise rights. Fair value of each reporting unit was determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on forecast cash flows (including underlying revenue and operating income growth rates) discounted using an estimated weighted average cost of capital of market participants. In determining fair value, management relied on and considered a number of factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections including the timing for an economic recovery, cash flow forecasts, market data, and our overall market capitalization. Based on the factors described above, actual and anticipated reductions in demand for the reporting units products and services as well as increased risk due to economic uncertainty, the estimates of future cash flows used in the second quarter of 2009 discounted cash flow analyses were revised downward from our most recent test conducted during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2008. Furthermore, the range of the weighted average cost of capital utilized was increased to reflect increased risk due to economic volatility and uncertainties related to demand for our products and services. The results of the goodwill impairment tests indicated that the implied goodwill amount was less than the carrying amount of goodwill for each of the aforementioned reporting units. We recorded an aggregate non cash impairment charge of $2.6 billion ($2.6 billion after tax) during the second quarter of 2009. The non cash impairment charge was recorded in goodwill and intangible asset impairments in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the quarter ended March 27, 2009. Indefinite lived intangible assets consisting primarily of trade names and franchise rights were tested for impairment using either a relief from royalty method or excess earnings method, which include the selection of appropriate discount rates, royalty rates and terminal year growth rate assumptions and estimates of the amount and timing of future cash flows attributable to the underlying intangible assets. Also, during the second quarter of 2009, our estimates of future cash flows used in 47 Table of Contents determining the fair value of our Safety Products segment Sensormatic tradename as well as certain ADT Worldwide segment franchise rights were revised downward relative to the estimates used in our tests during the fourth quarter of 2008. The results of the impairment test indicated that the Safety Products Sensormatic tradename and ADT Worldwide franchise rights estimated fair values were less than their respective carrying amounts. As a result, we recorded an aggregate non cash impairment charge of $64 million ($40 million after tax) during the second quarter of 2009. The non cash impairment charge was recorded in goodwill and intangible asset impairments in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the quarter ended March 27, 2009.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. Depreciation and Amortization Methods for Security Monitoring Related Assets Tyco considers assets related to the acquisition of new customers in its electronic security business in three asset categories: internally generated residential subscriber systems, internally generated commercial subscriber systems (collectively referred to as subscriber system assets) and customer accounts acquired through the ADT dealer program (referred to as dealer intangibles). Subscriber system assets include installed property, plant and equipment for which Tyco retains ownership and deferred costs directly related to the customer acquisition and system installation. Subscriber system assets and any deferred revenue resulting from the customer acquisition are accounted for over the expected life of the subscriber. In certain geographical areas where the Company has a large number of customers that behave in a similar manner over time, the Company accounts for subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue using pools, with separate pools for the components of subscriber system assets and any related deferred revenue based on the month and year of acquisition. The Company depreciates its pooled subscriber system assets (primarily in North America) and related deferred revenue using an accelerated method with lives up to 15 years. The accelerated method utilizes declining balance rates based on geographical area ranging from 160% to 195% for residential subscriber pools and 145% to 265% for commercial subscriber pools and converts to a straight line methodology when the resulting depreciation charge is greater than that from the accelerated method. The Company uses a straight line method with a 14 year life for non pooled subscriber system assets (primarily in Europe and Asia) and related deferred revenue, with remaining balances written off upon customer termination. Revenue Recognition Contract sales for the installation of fire protection systems, large security intruder systems and other construction related projects are recorded primarily under the percentage of completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related total cost of the project at completion. The risk of this methodology is its dependence upon estimates of costs at completion, which are subject to the uncertainties inherent in long term contracts. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they become determinable. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience and trend analysis. 48  Table of Contents Loss Contingencies Accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings, self insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on judgment, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates. Additionally, the Company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. Asbestos Related Contingencies and Insurance Receivables We and certain of our subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials. We estimate the liability and corresponding insurance recovery for pending and future claims and defense costs predominantly based on claim experience over the past five years, and a projection which covers claims expected to be filed, including related defense costs, over the next seven years on an undiscounted basis. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the pattern and length of time over which claims will be made and then settled or litigated, we use multiple estimation methodologies based on varying scenarios of potential outcomes to estimate the range of loss. We have concluded that estimating the liability beyond the seven year period will not provide a reasonable estimate, as these uncertainties increase significantly as the projection period lengthens. In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are probable. The estimate of asbestos related insurance recoveries represents estimated amounts due to us for previously paid and settled claims and the probable reimbursements relating to estimated liability for pending and future claims. In determining the amount of insurance recoverable, we consider a number of factors, including available insurance, allocation methodologies, solvency and creditworthiness of the insurers. Annually, we perform a detailed analysis with the assistance of outside legal counsel and other experts to review and update as appropriate the underlying assumptions used in the estimated asbestos related assets and liabilities. On a quarterly basis, we re evaluate the assumptions used to perform the annual analysis and record an expense as necessary to reflect changes in the estimated liability and related insurance asset. See Note 14 to the financial statements for a discussion of managements judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of asbestos related assets and liabilities. Income Taxes In determining taxable income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future pre tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We currently have recorded valuation allowances that we will maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense recorded in the future may be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction. Any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in 49 Table of Contents the valuation allowance could result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management records the affect of a tax rate or law change on the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period of enactment. Future tax rate or law changes could have a material effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Asset Impairments Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually and more frequently if triggering events occur. In performing these assessments, management relies on various factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections including expectations and assumptions regarding the timing and degree of any economic recovery, anticipated future cash flows, comparable market transactions (to the extent available) and other market data. We elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for all goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. In the first step of the goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. Fair value for the goodwill impairment test is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on forecast cash flows (including estimated underlying revenue and operating income growth rates) discounted using an estimated weighted average cost of capital for market participants. A market approach, utilizing observable market data such as comparable companies in similar lines of business that are publicly traded or which are part of a public or private transaction (to the extent available), is used to corroborate the discounted cash flow analysis performed at each reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered potentially impaired and further tests are performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. In the second step of the goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill. Based on our most recent annual goodwill impairment assessment performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we determined that none of our reporting units with significant goodwill were at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions 50 Table of Contents made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of the aforementioned reporting units may include such items as follows: A prolonged downturn in the business environment in which the reporting units operate (i.e. sales volumes and prices) especially in the commercial construction and retailer end markets; An economic recovery that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing or degree; Volatility in equity and debt markets resulting in higher discount rates; and Unexpected regulatory changes. While historical performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values of goodwill in excess of carrying values, if our assumptions are not realized, it is possible that in the future an impairment charge may need to be recorded. However, it is not possible at this time to determine if an impairment charge would result or if such a charge would be material. Long Lived Assets Asset groups held and used by the Company, including property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be fully recoverable. Tyco performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if impairment exists. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, Tyco groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identified. If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Impairments to long lived assets to be disposed of are recorded based upon the fair value less cost to sell of the applicable assets. The calculation of the fair value of long lived assets is based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of long lived assets, there is a risk that the carrying value of our long lived assets may be overstated or understated. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations. Two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions resulting in actuarial gains and losses. For active plans, such actuarial gains and losses will be amortized over the average expected service period of the participants and in the case of inactive plans over the average remaining life expectancy of participants. The discount rate represents the market rate for high quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of pension obligations by approximately $89 million and increase our annual pension expense by approximately $7 million. We consider the relative weighting of plan assets by class, historical performance of asset classes over long term periods, asset class performance expectations as well as current and future economic conditions in determining the expected long term return on plan assets. A 50 basis point decrease in the expected long term return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately $8 million.  Liquidity and Capital Resources A fundamental objective of the Company is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of its core businesses around the 51 Table of Contents world. The primary source of funds to finance our operations and capital expenditures is cash generated by operations. In addition, we maintain a commercial paper program, have access to committed revolving credit lines and have access to equity and debt capital from public and private sources. We continue to balance our operating, investing and financing uses of cash through investment in our core businesses, strategic acquisitions and divestitures, dividends and share repurchases. We believe our cash position, amounts available under our credit facilities and cash provided by operating activities will be adequate to cover our operational and business needs. We had $1.8 billion and $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, respectively. Cash generated by operating activities increased to $2.6 billion for the 2010 fiscal year compared to $2.4 billion in fiscal 2009. Cash used in investing activities was $1.8 billion for the 2010 fiscal year compared to $1.3 billion in fiscal 2009. Cash used in financing activities was $1.4 billion for the 2010 fiscal year compared to $0.3 billion in fiscal 2009. As of September 24, 2010, our shareholders equity was $14.1 billion and our total debt was $4.2 billion. In addition, we had lines of credit totaling approximately $1.7 billion, none of which were drawn. Our ratio of total debt to total capital (the sum of our short and long term debt and shareholders equity) was 23% at September 24, 2010 and 25% at September 25, 2009. This ratio is a measure of our long term liquidity and is an indicator of financial flexibility. We continue to monitor market conditions and assess the impact, if any, on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. More than 95% of our U.S. and non U.S. funded pension plans are invested in marketable investments, including publicly traded equity and fixed income securities. Our funding policy is to make contributions in accordance with the laws and customs of the various countries in which we operate as well as to make discretionary contributions from time to time. We anticipate that we will contribute at least the minimum required to our pension plans in 2011 of $12 million for the U.S. plans and $52 million for non U.S. plans. We also anticipate making discretionary contributions of approximately $20 million to our U.S. plans during 2011. 52 Table of Contents Cash flow from operating activities The sources of our cash flow from operating activities and the use of a portion of that cash in our operations for the years ended September 24, 2010, September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008 were as follows ($ in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Cash flows from operating activities: Operating income (loss) $ 1,598 $ (1,506 ) $ 1,896 Goodwill and intangible asset impairments 2,705 10 Non cash restructuring and asset impairment charges, net (1 ) 23 34 (Gain) loss on divestitures (41 ) 13 Depreciation and amortization(1) 1,203 1,126 1,148 Non cash compensation expense 120 103 99 Deferred income taxes (129 ) (90 ) (99 ) Provision for losses on accounts receivable and inventory 127 156 133 Loss (gain) on the retirement of debt 87 (2 ) 258 Other, net (49 ) 59 (121 ) Class action settlement liability (3,020 ) Net change in working capital 106 128 (640 ) Interest income 31 44 112 Interest expense (284 ) (301 ) (396 ) Income tax expense (138 ) (71 ) (326 ) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 2,630 $ 2,387 $ (912 ) Other cash flow items: Capital expenditures, net(2) $ (689 ) $ (690 ) $ (697 ) (Increase) decrease in the sale of accounts receivable (2 ) 10 14 Accounts purchased by ADT (559 ) (543 ) (376 ) Purchase accounting and holdback liabilities (3 ) (2 ) (2 ) Voluntary pension contributions 22 4 (1)Includes depreciation expense of $654 million, $610 million, and $620 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and amortization of intangible assets of $549 million, $516 million and $528 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. (2)Includes net proceeds received for the sale/disposition of property, plant and equipment of $29 million, $12 million and $25 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The net change in working capital increased operating cash flow by $106 million in 2010. The components of this change are set forth in detail in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The significant changes in working capital included a $119 million increase in accounts payable and an $88 million decrease in prepaid and other current assets which were partially offset by a $108 million increase in inventories. The net change in working capital increased operating cash flow by $128 million in 2009. The components of this change are set forth in detail in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The significant changes in working capital included a $346 million decrease in inventory, a $191 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $106 million net decrease in contracts in progress, partially offset by a $337 million decrease in accounts payable and a $138 million decrease in income taxes, net. The net change in working capital decreased operating cash flow by $640 million in 2008. The components of this change are set forth in detail in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The significant changes in working capital included a $186 million increase in accounts receivable, a $140 million increase in inventories and a $155 million decrease in accrued and other liabilities. 53 Table of Contents During 2010, 2009 and 2008 we paid approximately $160 million (inclusive of $2 million relating to the French security business being classified as held for sale), $152 million and $186 million, respectively, in cash related to restructuring activities. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our restructuring activities. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, related to continuing operations were $255 million, $281 million and $489 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Cash flow from investing activities We made capital expenditures of $718 million, $702 million and $722 million during 2010, 2009 and 2008. The level of capital expenditures in fiscal year 2011 is expected to exceed the spending levels in fiscal year 2010 and is also expected to exceed depreciation. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, we paid approximately $559 million, $543 million and $376 million of cash, respectively, to acquire approximately 501,000, 512,000 and 370,000 customer contracts for electronic security services within our ADT Worldwide segment. During 2010, net cash paid for Broadview Security totaled $448 million by the Companys ADT Worldwide segment. In addition to the net cash paid to acquire Broadview Security, we issued approximately $1.4 billion of common shares as consideration. We paid cash for other acquisitions included in continuing operations totaling $152 million, net of cash acquired of $1 million. Additionally, our Flow Control segment acquired two Brazilian valve companies, including Hiter Industria e Comercio de Controle Termo Hidraulico Ltda ("Hiter"), a valve manufacturer which serves a variety of industries including the oil and gas, chemical and petrochemical markets. Net cash paid for the Brazilian valve companies totaled $104 million. Our Electrical and Metal Products segment acquired certain assets of a business for $39 million and our Safety Products segment acquired a business for $9 million. During 2010, we received cash proceeds, net of cash retained in the amount of $21 million for divestitures included in continuing operations primarily within our Safety Products, Flow Control, and ADT Worldwide segments. During the second quarter of 2008, Tyco released $2,960 million of funds placed in escrow during the third quarter of 2007 as well as $60 million of interest earned on those funds for the benefit of the class stipulated in the courts final order related to the class action settlement of claims alleging securities fraud for actions taken by former senior management. Cash flow from financing activities On May 5, 2010, Tyco International Finance, S.A. ("TIFSA"), our finance subsidiary, issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375% notes due on October 15, 2015, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by us, and received net cash proceeds of approximately $495 million. On May 28, 2010, we used the net proceeds of the aforementioned offering and additional cash on hand to redeem notes which aggregated $878 million in principal amount. The notes that were redeemed were TIFSAs 6.375% notes due 2011, its 7% notes due 2028 and its 6.875% notes due 2029. On October 5, 2009, TIFSA issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% notes due on October 15, 2014, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by us, and received net cash proceeds of approximately $495 million. Net repayments of short term debt were approximately $243 million in 2010, which primarily related to the extinguishment of $200 million of outstanding commercial paper during the first quarter of 2010. As of September 24, 2010, there was no commercial paper outstanding. Additionally, 54 Table of Contents repayments of long term debt were $962 million, which primarily related to the redemption of all of the 6.375% public notes due 2011, 7% notes due 2028, and 6.875% notes due 2029. The repayments of long term debt were more than offset by approximately $1.0 billion of proceeds received from the issuance of long term debt. Pursuant to our share repurchase program, we may repurchase Tyco shares from time to time in open market purchases at prevailing market prices, in negotiated transactions off the market, or pursuant to an approved 10b5 1 trading plan in accordance with applicable regulations. During the year ended September 24, 2010, we repurchased approximately 24 million common shares of the remaining $900 million authorized under our $1.0 billion share repurchase program approved by our board of directors on July 10, 2008. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. On September 8, 2010, the Board of Directors approved a new $1.0 billion share repurchase program ("2010 Share Repurchase Program"). On March 10, 2010, our shareholders approved an annual dividend on our common shares of CHF 0.90 per share, which is being paid in the form of a return on capital in four installments of CHF 0.22, CHF 0.22, CHF 0.23 and CHF 0.23 through February 2011. During 2010, 2009 and 2008 we paid cash dividends of approximately $416 million, $388 million and $292 million, respectively. Management believes that cash generated by or available to us should be sufficient to fund our capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future, including quarterly dividend payments and share repurchases. 55  Table of Contents  Commitments and Contingencies Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations and commitments for debt, minimum lease payment obligations under non cancelable operating leases and other obligations as of September 24, 2010 are as follows ($ in millions): Fiscal Year 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total Debt principal(1) $ 516 $ $ $ 656 $ 500 $ 2,379 $ 4,051 Interest payments(2) 235 219 219 199 169 632 1,673 Capital leases(3) 21 5 5 6 6 35 78 Operating leases 254 194 131 86 56 155 876 Purchase obligations(4) 488 6 3 497 Total contractual cash obligations(5) $ 1,514 $ 424 $ 358 $ 947 $ 731 $ 3,201 $ 7,175 (1)Excludes debt discount, swap activity and interest. (2)Interest payments consist of interest on our fixed interest rate debt and exclude the impact of our interest rate swaps. As of September 24, 2010, we had swapped an aggregate of approximately $1.5 billion of fixed for floating rate debt. (3)Excludes interest. (4)Purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of goods and services. (5)Other long term liabilities excluded from the above contractual obligation table primarily consist of the following: pension and postretirement costs, income taxes, warranties and environmental liabilities. We are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items due to the inherent uncertainties related to these obligations. However, the minimum required contributions to our pension plans are expected to be approximately $64 million in 2011 and we expect to pay $6 million in 2011 related to postretirement benefit plans. In addition, we expect to make a payment of $156 million for resolution of certain of the outstanding IRS audit matters within the next twelve months (see Note 6). As of September 24, 2010, we recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $318 million and gross interest and penalties of $63 million. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing for the payments in future years of such unrecognized tax benefits; therefore, such amounts have been excluded from the above contractual obligation table. However, based on the current status of our income tax audits, we believe that is reasonably possible that between $18 million and $140 million in unrecognized tax benefits may be resolved in the next twelve months. As of September 24, 2010, we had total commitments of $1.69 billion under our revolving credit facilities, $500 million of which expires on June 24, 2011 and $1.19 billion of which expires on April 25, 2012. As of September 24, 2010, there were no amounts drawn under these revolving credit facilities. TIFSAs bank credit agreements contain customary terms and conditions, and financial covenants that limit the ratio of our debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and that limit our ability to incur subsidiary debt or grant liens on our property. Our indentures contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges, subsidiary debt and sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are considered restrictive to our business. In May 2008, TIFSA commenced issuing commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes. As of September 24, 2010, TIFSA had no commercial paper outstanding. In the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 56 Table of Contents In connection with the Separation, we entered into a liability sharing agreement regarding certain actions that were pending against Tyco prior to the Separation. Under the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, we have assumed 27%, Covidien has assumed 42% and Tyco Electronics has assumed 31% of certain Tyco pre Separation contingent and other corporate liabilities, which, as of September 24, 2010, primarily relate to tax contingencies and potential actions with respect to the spin offs or the distributions made or brought by any third party. Backlog As of September 24, 2010 we had a backlog of unfilled orders of $9.5 billion compared to a backlog of $8.9 billion as of September 25, 2009. We expect that approximately 87% of our backlog as of September 24, 2010 will be filled during the next 12 months. Backlog by segment was as follows ($ in millions): September 24, 2010 September 25, 2009 ADT Worldwide $ 6,589 $ 5,916 Flow Control 1,482 1,646 Fire Protection Services 1,196 1,171 Electrical and Metal Products 88 72 Safety Products 121 102 $ 9,476 $ 8,907 Backlog increased $569 million, or 6.4%, to $9.5 billion as of September 24, 2010. The increase in backlog was primarily due to an increase in recurring revenue in force in our ADT Worldwide segment, partially offset by decreased bookings in our Flow Control segment. ADT Worldwides backlog includes recurring revenue in force and long term deferred revenue for upfront fees paid by customers for ADT owned security systems. Revenue in force represents 12 months revenue associated with monitoring and maintenance services under contract in the security business. ADT Worldwides backlog of $6.6 billion and $5.9 billion as of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, respectively, consists primarily of $4.8 billion and $4.0 billion of recurring revenue in force as of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, respectively, and $1.1 billion of deferred revenue for both September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009. ADT Worldwides backlog increased $673 million primarily driven by an increase in revenue in force of $724 million, including $540 million estimated to be contributed by the Broadview Security acquisition, and favorable changes in foreign currency of $15 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in bookings of $48 million in our ADT EMEA operations and a reduction in deferred revenue of $36 million. Flow Controls backlog decreased by $164 million primarily due to decreased bookings of $162 million as several large projects were completed during fiscal 2010. Fire Protections backlog increased by $25 million primarily due to an increase of $100 million in the Asia Pacific region and favorable changes in foreign currency of $14 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases experienced in EMEA and North America of $57 million and $18 million, respectively. Backlog within Safety Products increased $19 million primarily as a result of increased orders across various businesses.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale of Accounts Receivable Certain of our international businesses utilize the sale of accounts receivable as short term financing mechanisms. The aggregate amount outstanding under our international accounts receivable programs was not material as of September 24, 2010, September 25, 2009 or September 26, 2008. 57 Table of Contents Guarantees Certain of our business segments have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from the current fiscal year through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would typically be triggered in the event of nonperformance and performance under the guarantees, if required, would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. There are certain guarantees or indemnifications extended among Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics in accordance with the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Tax Sharing Agreement. The guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the Tax Sharing Agreement. At the time of the Separation, we recorded a liability necessary to recognize the fair value of such guarantees and indemnifications. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Tax Sharing Agreement. In addition, prior to the Separation we provided support in the form of financial and or performance guarantees to various Covidien and Tyco Electronics operating entities. To the extent these guarantees were not assigned in connection with the Separation, we assumed primary liability on any remaining such support. These obligations were not material to us as of September 24, 2010. In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these liabilities. In the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. We record estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As of September 24, 2010, we had total outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees of approximately $740 million. For a detailed discussion of guarantees and indemnifications, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements.  Forward Looking Information Certain statements in this report are "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. All statements contained herein that are not clearly historical in nature are forward looking, and the words "anticipate," "believe," "expect," "estimate," "project" and similar expressions are generally intended to identify forward looking statements. Any forward looking statement contained herein, in press releases, written statements or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), or in Tycos communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls and conference calls, regarding expectations with respect to sales, earnings, cash flows, operating and tax efficiencies, product 58 Table of Contents expansion, backlog, the consummation and benefits of acquisitions and divestitures, as well as financings and repurchases of debt or equity securities, are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and contingencies. Many of these risks, uncertainties and contingencies are beyond our control, and may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from anticipated results, performances or achievements. Factors that might affect such forward looking statements include, among other things: overall economic and business conditions; the demand for Tycos goods and services; competitive factors in the industries in which Tyco competes; changes in tax requirements (including tax rate changes, new tax laws or treaties and revised tax law interpretations); results and consequences of Tycos internal investigations and governmental investigations concerning the Companys governance, management, internal controls and operations including its business operations outside the United States; the outcome of litigation, arbitrations and governmental proceedings; effect of income tax audit settlement and appeals; our ability to repay or refinance our outstanding indebtedness as it matures; our ability to operate within the limitations imposed by financing arrangements and to maintain our credit ratings; interest rate fluctuations and other changes in borrowing costs; other capital market conditions, including availability of funding sources and currency exchange rate fluctuations; availability of and fluctuations in the prices of key raw materials, including steel and copper; economic and political conditions in international markets, including governmental changes and restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders; the ability to achieve cost savings in connection with the Companys strategic restructuring and Six Sigma initiatives; our ability to execute our portfolio refinement and acquisition strategies; potential further impairment of our goodwill, intangibles and or our long lived assets; the impact of fluctuations in the price of Tyco common shares; risks associated with the change in our Swiss incorporation, including the possibility of reduced flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management, increased or different regulatory burdens, and the possibility that we may not realize anticipated tax benefits; changes in U.S. and non U.S. government laws and regulations; and the possible effects on Tyco of future legislation in the United States that may limit or eliminate potential U.S. tax benefits resulting from Tyco Internationals Swiss incorporation or deny U.S. government contracts to Tyco based upon its Swiss incorporation. 59 Table of Contents  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of conducting business, we are exposed to certain risks associated with potential changes in market conditions. These risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Accordingly, we have established a comprehensive risk management process to monitor, evaluate and manage the principal exposures to which we believe we are subject. We seek to manage these risks through the use of financial derivative instruments. Our portfolio of derivative financial instruments may, from time to time, include forward foreign currency exchange contracts, foreign currency options, interest rate swaps, commodity swaps and forward commodity contracts. Derivative financial instruments related to interest rate sensitivity of debt obligations, intercompany cross border transactions and anticipated non functional currency cash flows are used with the goal of mitigating a significant portion of these exposures when it is cost effective to do so. We do not execute transactions or utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, to reduce the risk that a counterparty will be unable to honor its contractual obligations to us, we only enter into contracts with counterparties having at least an A /A3 long term debt rating. These counterparties are generally financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one party. Foreign Currency Exposures We hedge our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates through the use of forward foreign currency exchange contracts. During 2010, our largest exposures to foreign exchange rates existed primarily with the Swiss franc, British pound, Euro, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. The market risk related to the forward foreign currency exchange contracts (excluding the dividend hedge contract discussed below) is measured by estimating the potential impact of a 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates. The rates used to perform this analysis were based on the market rates in effect on September 24, 2010. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in an immaterial net decrease in the fair value of the contracts. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in an immaterial net increase in the fair value of the contracts. However, gains or losses on these derivative instruments are economically offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. Effective March 17, 2009, Tyco changed its jurisdiction of incorporation from Bermuda to Switzerland. Until the last payment is made in February 2011, Tyco intends to make dividend payments in the form of a reduction of capital denominated in Swiss francs. However, the Company expects to actually pay these dividends in U.S. dollars, based on exchange rates in effect shortly before the payment date. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to the Swiss franc between the date the dividend is declared and paid will increase or decrease the U.S. dollar amount required to be paid. The Company manages the potential variability in cash flows associated with the dividend payments by entering into derivative financial instruments used as economic hedges of the underlying risk. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Swiss franc would result in a $21 million net decrease in the fair value of the contracts. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Swiss franc would result in a $25 million net increase in the fair value of the contracts. However, gains or losses on these derivative instruments are economically offset by the amount of the dividend we would be required to pay. During the third quarter of 2010, Tyco International Finance, S.A. ("TIFSA"), the Companys finance subsidiary, entered into foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge its Euro denominated net investment. The aggregate notional amount of these hedges was approximately $255 million as of September 24, 2010. The potential impact from a 10% appreciation of the U.S. 60 Table of Contents dollar relative to the Euro would result in a $25 million net increase in other comprehensive income. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro would result in a $30 million net decrease in other comprehensive income. As of September 24, 2010, and September 25, 2009 $3.0 billion of intercompany loans have been designated as permanent in nature. For the fiscal years ended September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, we recorded $24 million and nil, respectively, of cumulative translation loss through accumulated other comprehensive loss related to these loans. Interest Rate Exposures Our long term debt portfolio primarily consists of fixed rate instruments. The Company manages its interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swap transactions with financial institutions acting as principal counterparties, which were designated as fair value hedges for accounting purposes. During the third quarter of 2009, first quarter of 2010 and third quarter of 2010, the Company entered into interest rate swap transactions with the objective of managing the exposure to interest rate risk by converting the interest rates on $1.4 billion, $500 million, and $501 million, respectively of fixed rate debt to variable rates. In these contracts, the Company agreed with financial institutions acting as principal counterparties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated on an agreed upon notional principal amount. In connection with the redemption of all of the 6.375% public notes due 2011 during the third quarter of 2010, the Company terminated the corresponding interest rate swaps. As of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, the total gross notional amount of the Companys interest rate swap contracts was $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates as of September 24, 2010 would result in a $37 million net decrease in the fair value of the contracts. Conversely, a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates as of September 24, 2010 would result in a $38 million net increase in the fair value of the contracts. Commodity Exposures We are exposed to volatility in the prices of raw materials used in some of our products and may, in limited circumstances, enter into hedging contracts to manage those exposures. These exposures are monitored as an integral part of our risk management program. During 2010, the Company entered into commodity swaps for copper which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. These swaps did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the price of copper as of September 24, 2010 would not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The Company has reclassified certain businesses which have satisfied the criteria to be presented as discontinued operations to income from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and assets and liabilities held for sale within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, the Company has realigned certain business operations during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 resulting in prior period segment amounts being recast. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. On May 14, 2010, we acquired all of the outstanding equity of Brinks Home Security Holdings, Inc. ("BHS" or "Broadview Security") in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately 34 Table of Contents $2.0 billion, with $585 million in cash being used to fund the acquisition. Broadview Security is being integrated into the Companys ADT Worldwide segment. Broadview Securitys core business is to provide security alarm monitoring services for residential and commercial properties in North America. It has a large residential recurring customer base, which has enhanced ADTs presence in the North American residential security business. Broadview Security is also a leader in technologies and services which are expected to enhance ADT Worldwides service offerings to its customers. In connection with the integration of Broadview Security into the ADT Worldwide segment, the Broadview Security brand has been discontinued, and we expect to realize cost savings and other synergies through operational efficiencies including consolidation of both marketing and general and administrative functions. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we initiated a program to fully integrate Broadview Security into our ADT Worldwide segment. We anticipate that Broadview Security will be fully integrated into our ADT Worldwide segments North America business during the first half of 2011. As a result, Broadview Securitys operating results, including its revenue and income from continuing operations, will be reflected in the operating results of our ADT North America business and will no longer be reported separately. Due to the integration of operations, we have estimated that Broadview Security contributed approximately $193 million to our consolidated net revenue and a loss from continuing operations of $25 million during 2010. We incurred approximately $17 million of costs directly related to the acquisition and $18 million of integration costs for a total of $35 million during 2010. Of this amount, $32 million has been recorded in our ADT Worldwide segment and $3 million in Corporate and Other. Both acquisition and integration costs have been recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Operations during 2010. In addition, our ADT Worldwide segment recorded $14 million of restructuring expenses related to combining the Broadview Security and ADT Worldwide businesses, which have been recorded within restructuring, asset impairments and divestiture charges, net in our Consolidated Statement of Operations during 2010. Also, during the third quarter of 2010, we announced our intention to pursue a tax free spin off of our Electrical and Metal Products business. On November 9, 2010, we announced an agreement to sell a 51% interest in our Electrical and Metal Products business. In connection with this announcement, we no longer plan to pursue the tax free spin off of our Electrical and Metal Products business as proposed on April 27, 2010. See Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Overview Net revenue for 2010 increased $134 million, or 0.8%, as compared to 2009. The increase was primarily driven by the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $624 million, or 3.7%. This increase was partially offset by net revenue declines experienced in our Flow Control and Fire Protection Services segments. Flow Controls decline in net revenue was primarily the result of reduced volume in its valves business driven by decreased demand in our end markets. Weakness in the commercial end market resulted in a decline in product and systems installation revenue within our Fire Protection Services segment. Service revenue continued to grow as a percentage of our overall revenue to 41% for 2010 as compared to 40% and 36% for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our service revenues are principally derived from our ADT Worldwide and Fire Protection Services businesses, and represent a predictable and consistent source of revenue. Recurring revenue in our ADT Worldwide business represents approximately 58% of ADTs total revenue compared to approximately 54% in 2009 and 51% in 2008. Recurring revenue represents revenue associated with monitoring and maintenance services under contractual arrangements. In the Fire Protection Services business, service revenue continued to increase as a percentage of Fire Protections total revenue to 52% in 2010, as compared to 49% and 48% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Net revenue was also favorably impacted by approximately 35 Table of Contents $69 million, or 0.4%, for net acquisitions and divestitures, which primarily related to the acquisition of Broadview Security partially offset by the sale of our French security business. Operating income during 2010 was $1.6 billion, compared to an operating loss of $1.5 billion during 2009. Operating income in 2009 was negatively affected by goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of approximately $2.7 billion and legacy legal settlement charges of approximately $125 million during 2009. Operating income in 2010 was favorably impacted by efficiencies gained from cost containment actions taken in fiscal 2010 and 2009 and restructuring actions taken in prior years. Restructuring and asset impairment charges decreased to $145 million during 2010 from $232 million during 2009. Operating income during 2010 was favorably impacted by net gains on divestitures of $40 million as compared to a loss on divestitures of $15 million during 2009. We also incurred acquisition and integration charges of $35 million during 2010 related to our acquisition of Broadview Security. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted operating income by $80 million during 2010. As of September 24, 2010, our cash balance was $1.8 billion, as compared to $2.4 billion as of September 25, 2009. We generated approximately $2.6 billion of cash from operating activities, which was more than offset by: $600 million of cash used for acquisitions net of cash acquired, primarily related to our acquisition of Broadview Security; accounts purchased by ADT and capital expenditures of $1.3 billion; approximately $900 million to repurchase our common shares; dividends paid of $416 million; and a net debt repayment of $204 million. We expect to continue to use our cash to fund internal growth opportunities, improve productivity across all of our businesses, make acquisitions that strategically fit within our ADT Worldwide, Fire Protection Services and Flow Control businesses and return capital to shareholders. On September 8, 2010, our Board of Directors approved a new $1.0 billion share repurchase program ("2010 repurchase program") as the remaining capacity under our existing $1.0 billion share repurchase program was substantially utilized by the end of August 2010. We did not repurchase any shares under the new program during 2010. In 2010, we also continued our portfolio refinement efforts by exiting areas that have not provided, and are not expected to provide, an adequate return on investment and by taking advantage of restructuring opportunities that are expected to provide future cost savings. During 2010, we incurred approximately $145 million of restructuring and asset impairment charges, substantially completing our 2009 restructuring program. During fiscal 2010, we identified additional opportunities for cost savings through restructuring activities in fiscal 2011. We expect to incur restructuring and restructuring related charges of approximately $150 million in fiscal 2011. Over the last few years, we have explored alternatives for under performing or non strategic businesses, including divestiture. We sold our French security business, which was part of our ADT Worldwide segment, resulting in a pre tax gain of $53 million during 2010. The gain and results of operations of the French security business are presented in continuing operations as the criteria for discontinued operations have not been met. As discussed above, during the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we announced our intention to sell a 51% interest in our Electrical and Metal Products business. See Notes 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, during the third quarter of fiscal 2010, our Board of Directors approved a plan to sell our European water business, which is part of our Flow Control segment. The business met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and has been included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. On September 30, 2010, we received the necessary consents and approval to complete the sale of this business and received net cash proceeds of approximately $267 million. We expect to recognize a gain on the transaction. 36 Table of Contents Operating Results Net revenue, operating income (loss) and net income (loss) for the years ended September 24, 2010, September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008 were as follows ($ in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Revenue from product sales $ 9,990 $ 10,134 $ 12,602 Service revenue 7,026 6,748 7,131 Net revenue $ 17,016 $ 16,882 $ 19,733 Operating income (loss) $ 1,598 $ (1,506 ) $ 1,896 Interest income 31 44 112 Interest expense (284 ) (301 ) (396 ) Other expense, net (75 ) (7 ) (223 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 1,270 (1,770 ) 1,389 Income tax expense (138 ) (71 ) (326 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations 1,132 (1,841 ) 1,063 Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes 7 47 491 Net income (loss) $ 1,139 $ (1,794 ) $ 1,554 Less: Noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries net income 7 4 1 Net income (loss) attributable to Tyco common shareholders $ 1,132 $ (1,798 ) $ 1,553 Segment Results The segment discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in results for each of our segments included in continuing operations. ADT Worldwide Net revenue, goodwill and intangible asset impairments, operating income (loss) and operating margin for ADT Worldwide for the years ended September 24, 2010, September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008 were as follows ($ in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Revenue from product sales $ 2,388 $ 2,270 $ 2,728 (1) Service revenue 4,988 4,796 5,074 (1) Net revenue $ 7,376 $ 7,066 $ 7,802 Goodwill and intangible asset impairments $ $ 1,023 $ 1 Operating income (loss) 1,056 (202 ) 866 Operating margin 14.3 % (2) 11.1 % (1)As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, revenue related to the sale of electronic tags and labels has been classified as revenue from product sales during fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2009 and 2008, the sale of the electronic tags and labels was misclassified as service revenue. The service revenue and revenue from product sales during fiscal 2009 and 2008 have not been changed for this misclassification, as the effect is not material. The impact of the misclassification for fiscal 2009 would have been to decrease service revenue by $286 million, with corresponding increases to revenue from product sales. The impact of the misclassification for fiscal 2008 would have been to decrease service revenue by $364 million, with corresponding increases to revenue from product sales. (2)Certain operating margins and percentages have not been presented as management believes such calculations are not meaningful. 37 Table of Contents Revenue from product sales includes sales and installation of electronic security and other life safety systems as well as products related to retailer anti theft systems. Service revenue is comprised of electronic security services and maintenance, including the monitoring of burglar alarms, fire alarms and other life safety systems as well as other security services. Net revenue for ADT Worldwide increased $310 million, or 4.4%, during 2010, as compared to 2009. Net revenue was favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $218 million, or 3.1%. Net revenue was also favorably impacted by the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of $72 million, or 1.0%, which was primarily the result of $193 million in net revenue estimated to be contributed by the Broadview Security acquisition partially offset by $109 million of divested revenue relating to our French security business. Approximately 58% and 54% of ADT Worldwides total net revenue during 2010 and 2009, respectively, represents revenue associated with monitoring and maintenance services under contractual arrangements, which is considered recurring revenue. Recurring revenue increased by $435 million, or 11.3%, to approximately $4.3 billion as a result of growth in customer accounts of approximately 1.5 million, or 20.5%, to a total of approximately 8.9 million accounts as of September 24, 2010. Approximately 1.4 million customer accounts were acquired on May 14, 2010 in connection with the Broadview Security acquisition and approximately 501,000 customer accounts were acquired through the ADT dealer program during 2010. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted recurring revenue by $148 million in 2010, or 3.8%, and $116 million, or 3.0%, respectively. Systems installation, product sales and other service revenue declined by $125 million, or 3.9%, to approximately $3.1 billion due to lower sales volume primarily as the result of continued weakness in the commercial end market, which has declined at a slower rate than the same period in the prior year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted systems installation, product sales and other service revenue by $102 million, or 3.2%, while the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures resulted in an unfavorable impact of $76 million, or 2.4%. Net revenue by geographic area for ADT Worldwide for the years ended September 24, 2010, September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008 was as follows ($ in millions): 2010 2009 2008 North America $ 4,436 $ 4,185 $ 4,231 Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") 1,733 1,870 2,398 Rest of World 1,207 1,011 1,173 $ 7,376 $ 7,066 $ 7,802 Geographically, North America net revenue increased $251 million, or 6.0%, during 2010 primarily as the result of the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, which favorably impacted net revenue by an estimated $193 million, or 4.6%, as the result of the acquisition of Broadview Security. Partially offsetting this increase was a decline in systems installation and product sales as the result of continued weakness in the commercial market, although the rate of decline was slower than the same period in the prior year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates also favorably impacted net revenue by $48 million, or 1.1%. Net revenue in EMEA decreased $137 million, or 7.3%, as favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $60 million, or 3.2%, were more than offset by a decline in systems installation and other service revenue as a result of continued weakness in the commercial end market, although the rate of decline was slower than the same period in the prior year. Additionally, EMEA net revenue was unfavorably impacted by $121 million, or 6.5%, due to the impact of divestitures. Net revenue increased $196 million, or 19.4%, in the Rest of World geographies primarily due to recurring revenue growth in both Latin American and Asia Pacific regions as ADT Worldwide continues to focus on building its customer account and recurring revenue base in these markets. The Asia Pacific region experienced an increase in system installation, products sales and other service revenue which was 38 Table of Contents partially offset by a decrease in the Latin American region due to the continued slowdown in commercial and retailer end markets. Net revenue in the Rest of World geographies was also favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $110 million, or 10.9%. Attrition rates decreased during 2010 as compared to 2009 as shown in the following table: For the Fiscal Year Ended September 24, 2010 September 25, 2009 September 26, 2008 Attrition 12.8 % 13.3% (1) 12.9% (1) (1)Attrition rates for the years ended September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008 have been recast to reflect the divestiture of our French security business, which resulted in reductions of 0.1% in the amounts previously reported for September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008, respectively. Operating income increased by approximately $1.3 billion during 2010 as compared to 2009. Operating income for 2009 was negatively affected by goodwill impairment charges of $959 million recorded at our ADT EMEA and Sensormatic Retail Solutions reporting units and intangible asset impairment charges of $64 million. Operating income in 2010 was positively impacted by the shift to higher margin recurring revenue. Additionally, 2010 operating income was favorably impacted by the net impact of savings realized through previous restructuring actions, savings realized through cost containment actions, and a curtailment gain of $12 million recognized when certain defined benefit pension plans were frozen in the United Kingdom. These increases were partially offset by an increase in the amortization of intangible assets primarily relating to the Broadview Security acquisition. During 2010, $60 million of net restructuring charges were incurred, of which $14 million related to restructuring actions associated with the acquisition of Broadview Security, as compared to $103 million of restructuring charges, net during 2009. Fiscal year 2010 also included a $45 million gain on divestitures, net primarily related to the sale of our French security business, and $32 million of acquisition and integration costs related to the acquisition of Broadview Security, as compared to a $6 loss and nil of divestiture and acquisition costs, respectively, during 2009. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted operating income by $30 million. Net revenue for ADT Worldwide decreased $736 million, or 9.4%, during 2009 as compared to 2008. This decrease was primarily driven by the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $614 million. Revenue was positively affected by $152 million for the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Revenue from product sales decreased 16.8% and service revenue decreased 5.5%. Recurring revenue declined 3.5% during 2009 primarily as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which unfavorably impacted recurring revenue by 7.5%, but was offset by growth in North America and Asia. Product sales and installation and other service revenue declined 15.6% partially due to a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which unfavorably impacted system installation and service revenue by 8.3%, and lower sales volume due to weakness in the commercial markets, including the retailer end market. Geographically, revenue in North America decreased $46 million, or 1.1%, resulting from reduced spending primarily in the commercial markets, including the retailer end market. Revenue in EMEA decreased $528 million, or 22.0%, largely as a result of foreign currency exchange rates, which had an unfavorable impact of $328 million. The remaining decrease in EMEA was primarily a result of a decline in product sales, systems installation and service revenue due to a slowdown in the commercial markets, including the retailer end market. Revenue declined $162 million, or 13.8%, in the Rest of World geographies, which was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $223 million partially offset by growth in Asia and Latin America. Operating income in 2009 decreased $1.1 billion as compared to 2008. Based on the deterioration in the commercial markets, including the retailer end market discussed above, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $959 million related to its ADT EMEA reporting unit and intangible 39 Table of Contents asset impairment charges of $64 million related to certain franchise rights within North America during the second quarter of 2009. The decrease is also related to the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $45 million. The decrease was further driven by the decline in sales volume as well as an increase in bad debt charges, both as a result of the weakness experienced in the commercial markets, including the retailer end market, and adverse global economic conditions. Operating income was negatively impacted by restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges of $109 million in 2009. Operating income in 2008 included restructuring charges of $119 million and expenses of $51 million primarily to convert customers from analog to digital signal transmission in North America. There were no charges related to converting customers to digital signal during 2009. The decline in operating income was partially offset by savings realized through cost containment and restructuring actions. Flow Control Net revenue, operating income and operating margin for Flow Control for the years ended September 24, 2010, September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008 were as follows ($ in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Revenue from product sales $ 3,089 $ 3,232 $ 3,740 Service revenue 284 263 212 Net revenue $ 3,373 $ 3,495 $ 3,952 Operating income $ 410 $ 496 $ 574 Operating margin 12.2 % 14.2 % 14.5 % Net revenue for Flow Control decreased $122 million, or 3.5%, during 2010 as compared to 2009. The decrease in net revenue was primarily driven by reduced volume in the valves business driven by decreased demand in our end markets. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net revenue by $218 million, or 6.2%, as well as the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures by $10 million, or 0.3%. The decrease in operating income of $86 million, or 17.3%, during 2010 as compared to 2009, was primarily due to decreased volume in our valves business and an expected loss related to completion of a long term construction project of approximately $18 million. These declines were partially offset by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $31 million, or 6.3%. The decline in operating income was also partially offset by savings realized through cost containment and restructuring actions. Operating income was negatively impacted by $24 million of restructuring and divestiture charges, net during both 2010 and 2009. Additionally, management estimated that $5 million of additional charges resulting from restructuring actions were incurred during 2009. Net revenue for Flow Control decreased $457 million, or 11.6%, during 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease in net revenue was primarily driven by the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $418 million, or 10.6%. Revenue also decreased due to reduced volume in the water business and reduced project activity in the energy end market of the thermal controls business. The decrease in revenue was partially offset by an increase in the valves business primarily from the energy end market in EMEA. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures unfavorably impacted net revenue by $3 million in 2009 and favorably impacted net revenue by $16 million in 2008. Operating income decreased $78 million, or 13.6%, during 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $71 million as well as decreased volume in the water businesses discussed above offset by margin improvements in the valves business. Margins were also negatively impacted by restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges of $24 million. Additionally, management 40 Table of Contents estimates that $5 million of additional charges resulting from restructuring actions were incurred during 2009. Restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges were $6 million in 2008. Additionally, selling, general and administrative expenses during 2008 included an environmental remediation charge of $6 million related to the closure of a facility in North America. The decline in operating income was partially offset by savings realized through cost containment and restructuring actions. Fire Protection Services Net revenue, goodwill impairment, operating income and operating margin for Fire Protection Services for the years ended September 24, 2010, September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008 were as follows ($ in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Revenue from product sales $ 1,615 $ 1,734 $ 1,989 Service revenue 1,740 1,676 1,824 Net Revenue $ 3,355 $ 3,410 $ 3,813 Goodwill impairment $ $ 180 $ 9 Operating income 272 70 333 Operating margin 8.1 % (1) 8.7 % (1)Certain operating margins and percentage changes have not been presented as management believes such calculations are not meaningful. Revenue from product sales includes sales and installation of fire protection and other systems. Service revenue consists of inspection, maintenance, service and monitoring of fire detection and suppression systems. Net revenue by geographic area for Fire Protection Services was as follows ($ in millions): 2010 2009 2008 North America $ 1,940 $ 1,994 $ 2,111 International 1,415 1,416 1,702 Net revenue $ 3,355 $ 3,410 $ 3,813 Net revenue for Fire Protection Services decreased $55 million, or 1.6%, during 2010 compared to 2009. This decrease was primarily due to continued weakness in commercial markets and a shift from lower margin projects to higher projects, which more than offset the favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $118 million, or 3.5%. Geographically, net revenue in North America decreased $54 million, or 2.7%, primarily due to the continued decline in systems installation and upgrade activity in the sprinkler business. Reduced systems installation and upgrade activity in the electronic business as well as service revenue in the sprinkler and suppression businesses also contributed to the decrease, although to a much lesser extent. These declines were partially offset by an increase in service revenue in the electronic business. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted revenue in North America by $28 million, or 1.4%. Although net revenue in our international fire businesses decreased by $1 million, changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net revenue by $90 million, or 6.4%, which was almost entirely offset by a decrease in revenue due to continued weakness in the European commercial markets. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures unfavorably impacted revenue by $6 million, or 0.2%. Operating income increased $202 million during 2010 as compared to 2009. Operating income during 2009 was negatively affected by a goodwill impairment charge of $180 million recorded at the EMEA Fire reporting unit. Additionally, operating income in 2010 was favorably impacted by savings 41 Table of Contents realized through cost containment actions, and to a lesser extent, a curtailment gain of approximately $7 million recognized when certain defined benefit pension plans were frozen in the United Kingdom. During 2010, $34 million of restructuring and divestiture charges, net were incurred as compared to $45 million of restructuring charges during 2009. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted operating income by $11 million. The net increase in operating income was partially offset by the decreased sales volume discussed above. Net revenue for Fire Protection Services decreased $403 million, or 10.6%, during 2009 as compared to 2008. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $293 million, or 7.7%. Additionally, revenue declined due to the weakness in the commercial market and adverse global economic conditions. Geographically, revenue in our international fire businesses decreased by $286 million, or 16.8%, largely due to the impact of unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates discussed above as well as weakness in the European commercial markets. Additionally, revenue in our North America SimplexGrinnell business decreased by $117 million, 5.5%, primarily due to a decline in systems installation and upgrade activity in the sprinkler business. Operating income decreased $263 million during 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease was primarily due to a $180 million goodwill impairment in EMEA recorded during 2009 compared to a $9 million goodwill impairment in Latin America recorded during 2008. The decrease was further driven by the decline in sales volume discussed above as well as an increase in bad debt charges, both as a result of the weakness experienced in the commercial markets and adverse global economic conditions. There were restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges of $45 million in 2009 as compared to $26 million in 2008. Additionally, operating income decreased due to the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $10 million. The decline in operating income was partially offset by savings realized through cost containment and restructuring actions. Electrical and Metal Products Net revenue, goodwill impairment, operating income (loss) and operating margin for Electrical and Metal Products for the years ended September 24, 2010, September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008 were as follows ($ in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Revenue from product sales $ 1,394 $ 1,389 2,266 Service revenue 5 3 6 Net Revenue $ 1,399 $ 1,392 2,272 Goodwill impairment $ $ 935 $ Operating income (loss) 100 (938 ) 342 Operating margin 7.1 % (1) 15.1 % (1)Certain operating margins and percentage changes have not been presented as management believes such calculations are not meaningful. Net revenue for Electrical and Metal Products increased $7 million, or 0.5%, during 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in revenue was primarily due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $37 million, or 2.7%, and $24 million, or 1.7%; due to the favorable net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. These increases were partially offset by a decline in volume of armored cable products and, to a lesser extent, steel products. Higher selling prices for armored cable products were almost entirely offset by lower selling prices for steel products. Operating income increased approximately $1.0 billion during 2010 as compared to 2009. Operating income for 2009 was negatively affected by goodwill impairment charges of $935 million 42 Table of Contents recorded at the Electrical and Metal Products reporting unit. Also contributing to the increase in operating income were higher spreads for steel products resulting from lower raw material costs which more than offset lower selling prices. These increases in operating income were partially offset by lower volumes as well as higher raw material costs which more than offset higher selling prices for armor cable products. During 2010, $13 million of restructuring charges were incurred compared to $21 million of restructuring and divestiture charges during 2009. Additionally, $1 million of additional charges resulting from restructuring actions were incurred during 2009 as compared to no additional charges during 2010. Net revenue for Electrical and Metal Products decreased $880 million, or 38.7%, in 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to lower volume and selling prices of steel products largely resulting from a decline in the commercial market in North America. Lower volume and selling prices for armored cable products also contributed to the decline. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of $52 million, or 2.3%. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures negatively affected revenue by approximately $31 million, or 1.4%. Operating income decreased $1.3 billion in 2009 as compared to 2008. Based on the sales volume decrease as well as the significant decline in the price of steel, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $935 million during the second quarter of 2009. There was no goodwill impairment recorded during 2008. The decrease in operating income also related to volume declines as well as lower spreads for steel products. Spreads for steel products continued to decline as a direct result of higher raw material costs and lower selling prices. Lower restructuring and divestiture charges incurred in 2009 as compared to similar charges incurred in 2008 partially offset the decline in operating income discussed above. Results for 2009 included restructuring and divestiture charges of $21 million as compared to $42 million for 2008. Additionally, management estimates that $1 million of additional charges resulting from restructuring actions were incurred during 2009. Safety Products Net revenue, goodwill impairments, operating income (loss) and operating margin for Safety Products for the years ended September 24, 2010, September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008 were as follows ($ in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Revenue from product sales $ 1,504 $ 1,510 $ 1,880 Service revenue 9 9 9 Net Revenue $ 1,513 $ 1,519 $ 1,889 Goodwill impairments $ $ 567 $ Operating income (loss) $ 221 $ (367 ) $ 301 Operating margin 14.6 % (1) 15.9 % (1)Certain operating margins and percentage changes have not been presented as management believes such calculations are not meaningful. Net revenue for Safety Products decreased $6 million, or 0.4%, during 2010 as compared to 2009. The decrease in net revenue is primarily due to lower volume in our fire suppression business partially offset by higher volume experienced in our electronic security and life safety businesses. The decrease in our fire suppression business was primarily due to reduced spending in the commercial construction market. The increase in our electronic security and life safety businesses was due to higher volume primarily related to the introduction of several new products. Net revenue was favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $33 million, or 2.2%, which was almost entirely offset by the unfavorable impact of divestitures of $31 million, or 2.0%. 43  Table of Contents Operating income increased $588 million during 2010 compared to 2009. Operating income during 2009 was negatively affected by goodwill impairment charges of $567 million recorded at the Access Controls and Video Systems ("ACVS") and Life Safety reporting units. The increase in operating income is attributable to the increased sales volume in the electronic security and life safety businesses and a shift in product mix to higher margin products across all businesses, which was partially offset by the fire suppression sales volume decline discussed above and increased sales and marketing expense. Restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net was $12 million during 2010 as compared to $32 million of restructuring charges during 2009. Additionally, management estimated that $7 million of additional charges resulting from restructuring actions were incurred during 2009 as compared to no additional charges during 2010. Savings realized through cost containment and restructuring actions also contributed to the increase in operating income. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted operating income by $6 million. Net revenue for Safety Products decreased $370 million, or 19.6%, during 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease was primarily related to reduced volume in our fire suppression business, life safety and electronic security businesses, which were impacted by soft economic conditions. The remaining decrease was related to the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $114 million, 6.0%. The decrease in our fire suppression business was primarily due to reduced spending in the commercial construction market. The decrease in the life safety business was primarily due to reduced municipal spending. The electronic security business decrease was primarily due to the slow down in the retail sector, as retail capital projects and new store openings were canceled or delayed. Operating income decreased $668 million in 2009 as compared to 2008. The decline was primarily attributable to goodwill and intangible impairment charges of $567 million recorded during the quarter ended March 27, 2009 as a result of the slowdown in the commercial and retail markets. As discussed above, decreased sales volume within the fire suppression, life safety and electronic security businesses also negatively impacted operating income. Operating income was negatively impacted by restructuring charges of $32 million during 2009. Additionally, management estimates that $7 million of additional charges resulting from restructuring actions were incurred during 2009. The same period in the prior year included $47 million of restructuring and asset impairment charges, net. Operating income in 2009 also decreased by $16 million due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Operating income was also negatively impacted by a charge of $8 million relating to the amount of depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recorded had a business that was previously classified as held for sale been continuously classified as held and used (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Corporate and Other Corporate expense decreased $104 million, or 18.4%, to $461 million for 2010 compared to $565 million in 2009. Corporate expense during 2009 was negatively affected by approximately $125 million of charges related to legacy securities matters partially offset by a $16 million benefit related to a settlement reached with a former executive. Restructuring charges decreased to $1 million for 2010 as compared to $10 million in 2009. Corporate expense was also favorably impacted by savings realized through cost containment and restructuring charges. These decreases in Corporate expenses were partially offset by a $52 million net asbestos charge recorded during the third quarter of 2010 as compared to a $37 million net asbestos charge in 2009, both of which were recorded in conjunction with the valuation of our asbestos related liabilities and insurance assets. In addition, $4 million of divestiture charges, net, and $3 million of acquisition costs were recorded during the 2010 as compared to $6 million of divestiture charges, net, and nil of acquisition costs for 2009. Corporate expense for 2009 was $45 million higher as compared to the prior year, primarily resulting from a charge of approximately $125 million related to the settlement of legacy securities matters, which was partially offset by $16 million benefit related to a settlement reached with a former 44 Table of Contents executive. Additionally, corporate expense in 2009 included $16 million of restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net. Corporate expense for 2008 included net charges of $28 million composed of a $29 million charge for a legacy legal settlement, $4 million of separation costs and $5 million for restructuring, asset impairment and divestiture charges, net, offset by a credit of $10 million for class action settlement recoveries. The remaining decrease in corporate expense is primarily related to cost reduction initiatives and the restructuring program. Interest Income and Expense Interest income was $31 million in 2010, as compared to $44 million and $112 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in interest income from 2009 primarily related to lower investment yields. Interest expense was $284 million in 2010, as compared to $301 million and $396 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in interest expense is primarily related to savings from interest rate swaps and no amounts being drawn under the revolving credit facilities in 2010, partially offset by additional interest associated with the January and October 2009 debt issuances. The weighted average interest rate on total debt outstanding as of September 24, 2010, September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008 was 6.3%, 6.6% and 6.2%, respectively. Other Expense, Net Other expense, net of $75 million in 2010 primarily relates to a charge of $87 million as a loss on extinguishment of debt on the redemption of our 6.375% public notes due 2011, 7% notes due 2028 and 6.875% notes due 2029. See Note 11. This loss was partially offset by an $8 million gain recorded as a result of an increase in the receivables due from Covidien and Tyco Electronics under the Tax Sharing Agreement. See Note 6. Other expense, net of $7 million in 2009 primarily relates to a $14 million charge recorded as a result of a decrease in the receivables due from Covidien and Tyco Electronics under the Tax Sharing Agreement, which was partially offset by income of $5 million relating to a gain on derivative contracts used to economically hedge the foreign currency risk related to the Swiss franc denominated dividends. Other expense, net of $223 million in 2008 primarily relates to a charge of $258 million as a loss on extinguishment of debt related to the consent solicitation and exchange offers and termination of the bridge loan facility offset by income of $6 million recorded in connection with the settlement of the 3.125% convertible senior debentures and related financial instruments. We also recorded other than temporary impairments and realized losses on the sale of investments of $6 million related primarily to investments in corporate debt. Additionally, we recorded $40 million of income as a result of an increase in the receivables due from Covidien and Tyco Electronics under the Tax Sharing Agreement in connection with the adoption of the guidance pertaining to the accounting for uncertain income taxes. We also recorded $6 million of expense for other activity in accordance with the Tax Sharing Agreement during 2008. Income Taxes Effective Income Tax Rate Our effective income tax rate was 10.9% for 2010. Our tax rate was favorably impacted by pre tax income in tax jurisdictions with low tax rates. Additionally, the 2010 tax rate was further reduced by limited tax on certain business dispositions, a release of deferred tax valuation allowances and a non recurring item generating a tax benefit. The effective income tax rate for 2009 is not meaningful primarily as a result of the loss driven by goodwill impairment charges of $2.6 billion for which almost no tax benefit was available. Additionally, taxes for 2009 were positively impacted by increased 45 Table of Contents profitability in lower tax rate jurisdictions and release of contingency reserves partially offset by enacted tax law changes and changes in foreign exchange rates that negatively impacted the non U.S. deferred tax assets. Our effective income tax rate was 23.5% for 2008. Income taxes during 2008 were positively impacted by increased profitability in lower tax rate jurisdictions and release of deferred tax valuation allowances partially offset by enacted tax law changes that negatively impacted the non U.S. deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $1,379 million and $766 million as of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. The valuation allowance was calculated and recorded when we determined that it was more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets would not be realized. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as payment is not expected within one year. Other Income Tax Matters In connection with the spin offs of Covidien and Tyco Electronics from Tyco, Tyco entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that governs the rights and obligations of each party with respect to certain pre Separation income tax liabilities. More specifically, Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics share 27%, 42% and 31%, respectively, of shared income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to Tycos, Covidiens and Tyco Electronics U.S. and certain non U.S. income tax returns. Costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are generally shared equally among the parties. Consistent with the sharing provisions of the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco had a net receivable from Covidien and Tyco Electronics of $114 million and $106 million as of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, respectively. In addition, as of September 24, 2010, Tyco had a recorded liability of $554 million (of which $156 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and the remaining amount in other liabilities) representing the fair value of Tycos obligations under the Tax Sharing Agreement as of the date of the Separation. The liability was $554 million as of September 25, 2009, which was recorded in other liabilities. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we reclassified $156 million from other liabilities to accrued and other current liabilities as we expect to make a payment within the next twelve months to Covidien and Tyco Electronics related to resolution of certain IRS audit matters. Tyco and its subsidiaries income tax returns periodically are examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. The Company is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest have been assessed as uncertain income tax positions and recorded as appropriate. For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to Tycos income taxes, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 46 Table of Contents 2009 Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairments Annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, and more frequently if triggering events occur, we test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible assets with its carrying amount. We began to experience a decline in revenue during the first quarter of 2009 in our ADT Worldwide, Fire Protection Services and Safety Products segments as a result of a slowdown in the commercial markets, including the retailer end market as well as a decline in sales volume at our Electrical Metal Products segments. Although we considered and concluded that these factors did not constitute triggering events during the first quarter of 2009, the continued existence of these conditions during the second quarter of 2009, along with downward revisions to forecasted results, restructuring actions and weaker industry outlooks, caused us to conclude that sufficient indicators of impairment existed. Reporting units within ADT Worldwide, Fire Protection Services and Safety Products segments continued to be negatively impacted as a result of a slowdown in the commercial markets including the retailer end market. Additionally, our Electrical Metal Products reporting unit continued to be negatively impacted by a decline in sales volume due to the downturn in the non residential construction market. We determined that these underlying events and circumstances constituted triggering events for six reporting units where such events would more likely than not reduce the fair value below their respective carrying amounts. Specifically, we concluded that our EMEA Security and EMEA Fire reporting units within the ADT Worldwide and Fire Protection Services segments, our Electrical and Metal Products reporting unit within the Electrical and Metal Products segment and our ACVS, Life Safety and Sensormatic Retail Solutions ("SRS") reporting units within the Safety Products segment experienced triggering events such that the carrying values of these reporting units likely exceeded their fair values. Furthermore, we determined that certain indefinite lived intangible assets required impairment testing based on the underlying events and circumstances described as well as the continued deterioration of the business environment related to the retailer end market of our ADT Worldwide and Safety Products segments. As a result of the triggering events, we performed long lived asset, goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests for these reporting units and certain of our trade names and franchise rights. Fair value of each reporting unit was determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on forecast cash flows (including underlying revenue and operating income growth rates) discounted using an estimated weighted average cost of capital of market participants. In determining fair value, management relied on and considered a number of factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections including the timing for an economic recovery, cash flow forecasts, market data, and our overall market capitalization. Based on the factors described above, actual and anticipated reductions in demand for the reporting units products and services as well as increased risk due to economic uncertainty, the estimates of future cash flows used in the second quarter of 2009 discounted cash flow analyses were revised downward from our most recent test conducted during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2008. Furthermore, the range of the weighted average cost of capital utilized was increased to reflect increased risk due to economic volatility and uncertainties related to demand for our products and services. The results of the goodwill impairment tests indicated that the implied goodwill amount was less than the carrying amount of goodwill for each of the aforementioned reporting units. We recorded an aggregate non cash impairment charge of $2.6 billion ($2.6 billion after tax) during the second quarter of 2009. The non cash impairment charge was recorded in goodwill and intangible asset impairments in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the quarter ended March 27, 2009. Indefinite lived intangible assets consisting primarily of trade names and franchise rights were tested for impairment using either a relief from royalty method or excess earnings method, which include the selection of appropriate discount rates, royalty rates and terminal year growth rate assumptions and estimates of the amount and timing of future cash flows attributable to the underlying intangible assets. Also, during the second quarter of 2009, our estimates of future cash flows used in 47 Table of Contents determining the fair value of our Safety Products segment Sensormatic tradename as well as certain ADT Worldwide segment franchise rights were revised downward relative to the estimates used in our tests during the fourth quarter of 2008. The results of the impairment test indicated that the Safety Products Sensormatic tradename and ADT Worldwide franchise rights estimated fair values were less than their respective carrying amounts. As a result, we recorded an aggregate non cash impairment charge of $64 million ($40 million after tax) during the second quarter of 2009. The non cash impairment charge was recorded in goodwill and intangible asset impairments in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the quarter ended March 27, 2009.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. Depreciation and Amortization Methods for Security Monitoring Related Assets Tyco considers assets related to the acquisition of new customers in its electronic security business in three asset categories: internally generated residential subscriber systems, internally generated commercial subscriber systems (collectively referred to as subscriber system assets) and customer accounts acquired through the ADT dealer program (referred to as dealer intangibles). Subscriber system assets include installed property, plant and equipment for which Tyco retains ownership and deferred costs directly related to the customer acquisition and system installation. Subscriber system assets and any deferred revenue resulting from the customer acquisition are accounted for over the expected life of the subscriber. In certain geographical areas where the Company has a large number of customers that behave in a similar manner over time, the Company accounts for subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue using pools, with separate pools for the components of subscriber system assets and any related deferred revenue based on the month and year of acquisition. The Company depreciates its pooled subscriber system assets (primarily in North America) and related deferred revenue using an accelerated method with lives up to 15 years. The accelerated method utilizes declining balance rates based on geographical area ranging from 160% to 195% for residential subscriber pools and 145% to 265% for commercial subscriber pools and converts to a straight line methodology when the resulting depreciation charge is greater than that from the accelerated method. The Company uses a straight line method with a 14 year life for non pooled subscriber system assets (primarily in Europe and Asia) and related deferred revenue, with remaining balances written off upon customer termination. Revenue Recognition Contract sales for the installation of fire protection systems, large security intruder systems and other construction related projects are recorded primarily under the percentage of completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related total cost of the project at completion. The risk of this methodology is its dependence upon estimates of costs at completion, which are subject to the uncertainties inherent in long term contracts. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they become determinable. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience and trend analysis. 48  Table of Contents Loss Contingencies Accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings, self insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on judgment, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates. Additionally, the Company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. Asbestos Related Contingencies and Insurance Receivables We and certain of our subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials. We estimate the liability and corresponding insurance recovery for pending and future claims and defense costs predominantly based on claim experience over the past five years, and a projection which covers claims expected to be filed, including related defense costs, over the next seven years on an undiscounted basis. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the pattern and length of time over which claims will be made and then settled or litigated, we use multiple estimation methodologies based on varying scenarios of potential outcomes to estimate the range of loss. We have concluded that estimating the liability beyond the seven year period will not provide a reasonable estimate, as these uncertainties increase significantly as the projection period lengthens. In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are probable. The estimate of asbestos related insurance recoveries represents estimated amounts due to us for previously paid and settled claims and the probable reimbursements relating to estimated liability for pending and future claims. In determining the amount of insurance recoverable, we consider a number of factors, including available insurance, allocation methodologies, solvency and creditworthiness of the insurers. Annually, we perform a detailed analysis with the assistance of outside legal counsel and other experts to review and update as appropriate the underlying assumptions used in the estimated asbestos related assets and liabilities. On a quarterly basis, we re evaluate the assumptions used to perform the annual analysis and record an expense as necessary to reflect changes in the estimated liability and related insurance asset. See Note 14 to the financial statements for a discussion of managements judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of asbestos related assets and liabilities. Income Taxes In determining taxable income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future pre tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We currently have recorded valuation allowances that we will maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense recorded in the future may be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction. Any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in 49 Table of Contents the valuation allowance could result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management records the affect of a tax rate or law change on the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period of enactment. Future tax rate or law changes could have a material effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Asset Impairments Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually and more frequently if triggering events occur. In performing these assessments, management relies on various factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections including expectations and assumptions regarding the timing and degree of any economic recovery, anticipated future cash flows, comparable market transactions (to the extent available) and other market data. We elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for all goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. In the first step of the goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. Fair value for the goodwill impairment test is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on forecast cash flows (including estimated underlying revenue and operating income growth rates) discounted using an estimated weighted average cost of capital for market participants. A market approach, utilizing observable market data such as comparable companies in similar lines of business that are publicly traded or which are part of a public or private transaction (to the extent available), is used to corroborate the discounted cash flow analysis performed at each reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered potentially impaired and further tests are performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. In the second step of the goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill. Based on our most recent annual goodwill impairment assessment performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we determined that none of our reporting units with significant goodwill were at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions 50 Table of Contents made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of the aforementioned reporting units may include such items as follows: A prolonged downturn in the business environment in which the reporting units operate (i.e. sales volumes and prices) especially in the commercial construction and retailer end markets; An economic recovery that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing or degree; Volatility in equity and debt markets resulting in higher discount rates; and Unexpected regulatory changes. While historical performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values of goodwill in excess of carrying values, if our assumptions are not realized, it is possible that in the future an impairment charge may need to be recorded. However, it is not possible at this time to determine if an impairment charge would result or if such a charge would be material. Long Lived Assets Asset groups held and used by the Company, including property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be fully recoverable. Tyco performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if impairment exists. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, Tyco groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identified. If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Impairments to long lived assets to be disposed of are recorded based upon the fair value less cost to sell of the applicable assets. The calculation of the fair value of long lived assets is based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of long lived assets, there is a risk that the carrying value of our long lived assets may be overstated or understated. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations. Two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions resulting in actuarial gains and losses. For active plans, such actuarial gains and losses will be amortized over the average expected service period of the participants and in the case of inactive plans over the average remaining life expectancy of participants. The discount rate represents the market rate for high quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of pension obligations by approximately $89 million and increase our annual pension expense by approximately $7 million. We consider the relative weighting of plan assets by class, historical performance of asset classes over long term periods, asset class performance expectations as well as current and future economic conditions in determining the expected long term return on plan assets. A 50 basis point decrease in the expected long term return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately $8 million.  Liquidity and Capital Resources A fundamental objective of the Company is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of its core businesses around the 51 Table of Contents world. The primary source of funds to finance our operations and capital expenditures is cash generated by operations. In addition, we maintain a commercial paper program, have access to committed revolving credit lines and have access to equity and debt capital from public and private sources. We continue to balance our operating, investing and financing uses of cash through investment in our core businesses, strategic acquisitions and divestitures, dividends and share repurchases. We believe our cash position, amounts available under our credit facilities and cash provided by operating activities will be adequate to cover our operational and business needs. We had $1.8 billion and $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, respectively. Cash generated by operating activities increased to $2.6 billion for the 2010 fiscal year compared to $2.4 billion in fiscal 2009. Cash used in investing activities was $1.8 billion for the 2010 fiscal year compared to $1.3 billion in fiscal 2009. Cash used in financing activities was $1.4 billion for the 2010 fiscal year compared to $0.3 billion in fiscal 2009. As of September 24, 2010, our shareholders equity was $14.1 billion and our total debt was $4.2 billion. In addition, we had lines of credit totaling approximately $1.7 billion, none of which were drawn. Our ratio of total debt to total capital (the sum of our short and long term debt and shareholders equity) was 23% at September 24, 2010 and 25% at September 25, 2009. This ratio is a measure of our long term liquidity and is an indicator of financial flexibility. We continue to monitor market conditions and assess the impact, if any, on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. More than 95% of our U.S. and non U.S. funded pension plans are invested in marketable investments, including publicly traded equity and fixed income securities. Our funding policy is to make contributions in accordance with the laws and customs of the various countries in which we operate as well as to make discretionary contributions from time to time. We anticipate that we will contribute at least the minimum required to our pension plans in 2011 of $12 million for the U.S. plans and $52 million for non U.S. plans. We also anticipate making discretionary contributions of approximately $20 million to our U.S. plans during 2011. 52 Table of Contents Cash flow from operating activities The sources of our cash flow from operating activities and the use of a portion of that cash in our operations for the years ended September 24, 2010, September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008 were as follows ($ in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Cash flows from operating activities: Operating income (loss) $ 1,598 $ (1,506 ) $ 1,896 Goodwill and intangible asset impairments 2,705 10 Non cash restructuring and asset impairment charges, net (1 ) 23 34 (Gain) loss on divestitures (41 ) 13 Depreciation and amortization(1) 1,203 1,126 1,148 Non cash compensation expense 120 103 99 Deferred income taxes (129 ) (90 ) (99 ) Provision for losses on accounts receivable and inventory 127 156 133 Loss (gain) on the retirement of debt 87 (2 ) 258 Other, net (49 ) 59 (121 ) Class action settlement liability (3,020 ) Net change in working capital 106 128 (640 ) Interest income 31 44 112 Interest expense (284 ) (301 ) (396 ) Income tax expense (138 ) (71 ) (326 ) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 2,630 $ 2,387 $ (912 ) Other cash flow items: Capital expenditures, net(2) $ (689 ) $ (690 ) $ (697 ) (Increase) decrease in the sale of accounts receivable (2 ) 10 14 Accounts purchased by ADT (559 ) (543 ) (376 ) Purchase accounting and holdback liabilities (3 ) (2 ) (2 ) Voluntary pension contributions 22 4 (1)Includes depreciation expense of $654 million, $610 million, and $620 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and amortization of intangible assets of $549 million, $516 million and $528 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. (2)Includes net proceeds received for the sale/disposition of property, plant and equipment of $29 million, $12 million and $25 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The net change in working capital increased operating cash flow by $106 million in 2010. The components of this change are set forth in detail in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The significant changes in working capital included a $119 million increase in accounts payable and an $88 million decrease in prepaid and other current assets which were partially offset by a $108 million increase in inventories. The net change in working capital increased operating cash flow by $128 million in 2009. The components of this change are set forth in detail in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The significant changes in working capital included a $346 million decrease in inventory, a $191 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $106 million net decrease in contracts in progress, partially offset by a $337 million decrease in accounts payable and a $138 million decrease in income taxes, net. The net change in working capital decreased operating cash flow by $640 million in 2008. The components of this change are set forth in detail in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The significant changes in working capital included a $186 million increase in accounts receivable, a $140 million increase in inventories and a $155 million decrease in accrued and other liabilities. 53 Table of Contents During 2010, 2009 and 2008 we paid approximately $160 million (inclusive of $2 million relating to the French security business being classified as held for sale), $152 million and $186 million, respectively, in cash related to restructuring activities. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our restructuring activities. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, related to continuing operations were $255 million, $281 million and $489 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Cash flow from investing activities We made capital expenditures of $718 million, $702 million and $722 million during 2010, 2009 and 2008. The level of capital expenditures in fiscal year 2011 is expected to exceed the spending levels in fiscal year 2010 and is also expected to exceed depreciation. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, we paid approximately $559 million, $543 million and $376 million of cash, respectively, to acquire approximately 501,000, 512,000 and 370,000 customer contracts for electronic security services within our ADT Worldwide segment. During 2010, net cash paid for Broadview Security totaled $448 million by the Companys ADT Worldwide segment. In addition to the net cash paid to acquire Broadview Security, we issued approximately $1.4 billion of common shares as consideration. We paid cash for other acquisitions included in continuing operations totaling $152 million, net of cash acquired of $1 million. Additionally, our Flow Control segment acquired two Brazilian valve companies, including Hiter Industria e Comercio de Controle Termo Hidraulico Ltda ("Hiter"), a valve manufacturer which serves a variety of industries including the oil and gas, chemical and petrochemical markets. Net cash paid for the Brazilian valve companies totaled $104 million. Our Electrical and Metal Products segment acquired certain assets of a business for $39 million and our Safety Products segment acquired a business for $9 million. During 2010, we received cash proceeds, net of cash retained in the amount of $21 million for divestitures included in continuing operations primarily within our Safety Products, Flow Control, and ADT Worldwide segments. During the second quarter of 2008, Tyco released $2,960 million of funds placed in escrow during the third quarter of 2007 as well as $60 million of interest earned on those funds for the benefit of the class stipulated in the courts final order related to the class action settlement of claims alleging securities fraud for actions taken by former senior management. Cash flow from financing activities On May 5, 2010, Tyco International Finance, S.A. ("TIFSA"), our finance subsidiary, issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375% notes due on October 15, 2015, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by us, and received net cash proceeds of approximately $495 million. On May 28, 2010, we used the net proceeds of the aforementioned offering and additional cash on hand to redeem notes which aggregated $878 million in principal amount. The notes that were redeemed were TIFSAs 6.375% notes due 2011, its 7% notes due 2028 and its 6.875% notes due 2029. On October 5, 2009, TIFSA issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% notes due on October 15, 2014, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by us, and received net cash proceeds of approximately $495 million. Net repayments of short term debt were approximately $243 million in 2010, which primarily related to the extinguishment of $200 million of outstanding commercial paper during the first quarter of 2010. As of September 24, 2010, there was no commercial paper outstanding. Additionally, 54 Table of Contents repayments of long term debt were $962 million, which primarily related to the redemption of all of the 6.375% public notes due 2011, 7% notes due 2028, and 6.875% notes due 2029. The repayments of long term debt were more than offset by approximately $1.0 billion of proceeds received from the issuance of long term debt. Pursuant to our share repurchase program, we may repurchase Tyco shares from time to time in open market purchases at prevailing market prices, in negotiated transactions off the market, or pursuant to an approved 10b5 1 trading plan in accordance with applicable regulations. During the year ended September 24, 2010, we repurchased approximately 24 million common shares of the remaining $900 million authorized under our $1.0 billion share repurchase program approved by our board of directors on July 10, 2008. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. On September 8, 2010, the Board of Directors approved a new $1.0 billion share repurchase program ("2010 Share Repurchase Program"). On March 10, 2010, our shareholders approved an annual dividend on our common shares of CHF 0.90 per share, which is being paid in the form of a return on capital in four installments of CHF 0.22, CHF 0.22, CHF 0.23 and CHF 0.23 through February 2011. During 2010, 2009 and 2008 we paid cash dividends of approximately $416 million, $388 million and $292 million, respectively. Management believes that cash generated by or available to us should be sufficient to fund our capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future, including quarterly dividend payments and share repurchases. 55  Table of Contents  Commitments and Contingencies Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations and commitments for debt, minimum lease payment obligations under non cancelable operating leases and other obligations as of September 24, 2010 are as follows ($ in millions): Fiscal Year 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total Debt principal(1) $ 516 $ $ $ 656 $ 500 $ 2,379 $ 4,051 Interest payments(2) 235 219 219 199 169 632 1,673 Capital leases(3) 21 5 5 6 6 35 78 Operating leases 254 194 131 86 56 155 876 Purchase obligations(4) 488 6 3 497 Total contractual cash obligations(5) $ 1,514 $ 424 $ 358 $ 947 $ 731 $ 3,201 $ 7,175 (1)Excludes debt discount, swap activity and interest. (2)Interest payments consist of interest on our fixed interest rate debt and exclude the impact of our interest rate swaps. As of September 24, 2010, we had swapped an aggregate of approximately $1.5 billion of fixed for floating rate debt. (3)Excludes interest. (4)Purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of goods and services. (5)Other long term liabilities excluded from the above contractual obligation table primarily consist of the following: pension and postretirement costs, income taxes, warranties and environmental liabilities. We are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items due to the inherent uncertainties related to these obligations. However, the minimum required contributions to our pension plans are expected to be approximately $64 million in 2011 and we expect to pay $6 million in 2011 related to postretirement benefit plans. In addition, we expect to make a payment of $156 million for resolution of certain of the outstanding IRS audit matters within the next twelve months (see Note 6). As of September 24, 2010, we recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $318 million and gross interest and penalties of $63 million. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing for the payments in future years of such unrecognized tax benefits; therefore, such amounts have been excluded from the above contractual obligation table. However, based on the current status of our income tax audits, we believe that is reasonably possible that between $18 million and $140 million in unrecognized tax benefits may be resolved in the next twelve months. As of September 24, 2010, we had total commitments of $1.69 billion under our revolving credit facilities, $500 million of which expires on June 24, 2011 and $1.19 billion of which expires on April 25, 2012. As of September 24, 2010, there were no amounts drawn under these revolving credit facilities. TIFSAs bank credit agreements contain customary terms and conditions, and financial covenants that limit the ratio of our debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and that limit our ability to incur subsidiary debt or grant liens on our property. Our indentures contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges, subsidiary debt and sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are considered restrictive to our business. In May 2008, TIFSA commenced issuing commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes. As of September 24, 2010, TIFSA had no commercial paper outstanding. In the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 56 Table of Contents In connection with the Separation, we entered into a liability sharing agreement regarding certain actions that were pending against Tyco prior to the Separation. Under the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, we have assumed 27%, Covidien has assumed 42% and Tyco Electronics has assumed 31% of certain Tyco pre Separation contingent and other corporate liabilities, which, as of September 24, 2010, primarily relate to tax contingencies and potential actions with respect to the spin offs or the distributions made or brought by any third party. Backlog As of September 24, 2010 we had a backlog of unfilled orders of $9.5 billion compared to a backlog of $8.9 billion as of September 25, 2009. We expect that approximately 87% of our backlog as of September 24, 2010 will be filled during the next 12 months. Backlog by segment was as follows ($ in millions): September 24, 2010 September 25, 2009 ADT Worldwide $ 6,589 $ 5,916 Flow Control 1,482 1,646 Fire Protection Services 1,196 1,171 Electrical and Metal Products 88 72 Safety Products 121 102 $ 9,476 $ 8,907 Backlog increased $569 million, or 6.4%, to $9.5 billion as of September 24, 2010. The increase in backlog was primarily due to an increase in recurring revenue in force in our ADT Worldwide segment, partially offset by decreased bookings in our Flow Control segment. ADT Worldwides backlog includes recurring revenue in force and long term deferred revenue for upfront fees paid by customers for ADT owned security systems. Revenue in force represents 12 months revenue associated with monitoring and maintenance services under contract in the security business. ADT Worldwides backlog of $6.6 billion and $5.9 billion as of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, respectively, consists primarily of $4.8 billion and $4.0 billion of recurring revenue in force as of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, respectively, and $1.1 billion of deferred revenue for both September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009. ADT Worldwides backlog increased $673 million primarily driven by an increase in revenue in force of $724 million, including $540 million estimated to be contributed by the Broadview Security acquisition, and favorable changes in foreign currency of $15 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in bookings of $48 million in our ADT EMEA operations and a reduction in deferred revenue of $36 million. Flow Controls backlog decreased by $164 million primarily due to decreased bookings of $162 million as several large projects were completed during fiscal 2010. Fire Protections backlog increased by $25 million primarily due to an increase of $100 million in the Asia Pacific region and favorable changes in foreign currency of $14 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases experienced in EMEA and North America of $57 million and $18 million, respectively. Backlog within Safety Products increased $19 million primarily as a result of increased orders across various businesses.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale of Accounts Receivable Certain of our international businesses utilize the sale of accounts receivable as short term financing mechanisms. The aggregate amount outstanding under our international accounts receivable programs was not material as of September 24, 2010, September 25, 2009 or September 26, 2008. 57 Table of Contents Guarantees Certain of our business segments have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from the current fiscal year through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would typically be triggered in the event of nonperformance and performance under the guarantees, if required, would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. There are certain guarantees or indemnifications extended among Tyco, Covidien and Tyco Electronics in accordance with the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Tax Sharing Agreement. The guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the Tax Sharing Agreement. At the time of the Separation, we recorded a liability necessary to recognize the fair value of such guarantees and indemnifications. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Tax Sharing Agreement. In addition, prior to the Separation we provided support in the form of financial and or performance guarantees to various Covidien and Tyco Electronics operating entities. To the extent these guarantees were not assigned in connection with the Separation, we assumed primary liability on any remaining such support. These obligations were not material to us as of September 24, 2010. In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these liabilities. In the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. We record estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As of September 24, 2010, we had total outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees of approximately $740 million. For a detailed discussion of guarantees and indemnifications, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements.  Forward Looking Information Certain statements in this report are "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. All statements contained herein that are not clearly historical in nature are forward looking, and the words "anticipate," "believe," "expect," "estimate," "project" and similar expressions are generally intended to identify forward looking statements. Any forward looking statement contained herein, in press releases, written statements or other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), or in Tycos communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls and conference calls, regarding expectations with respect to sales, earnings, cash flows, operating and tax efficiencies, product 58 Table of Contents expansion, backlog, the consummation and benefits of acquisitions and divestitures, as well as financings and repurchases of debt or equity securities, are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and contingencies. Many of these risks, uncertainties and contingencies are beyond our control, and may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from anticipated results, performances or achievements. Factors that might affect such forward looking statements include, among other things: overall economic and business conditions; the demand for Tycos goods and services; competitive factors in the industries in which Tyco competes; changes in tax requirements (including tax rate changes, new tax laws or treaties and revised tax law interpretations); results and consequences of Tycos internal investigations and governmental investigations concerning the Companys governance, management, internal controls and operations including its business operations outside the United States; the outcome of litigation, arbitrations and governmental proceedings; effect of income tax audit settlement and appeals; our ability to repay or refinance our outstanding indebtedness as it matures; our ability to operate within the limitations imposed by financing arrangements and to maintain our credit ratings; interest rate fluctuations and other changes in borrowing costs; other capital market conditions, including availability of funding sources and currency exchange rate fluctuations; availability of and fluctuations in the prices of key raw materials, including steel and copper; economic and political conditions in international markets, including governmental changes and restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders; the ability to achieve cost savings in connection with the Companys strategic restructuring and Six Sigma initiatives; our ability to execute our portfolio refinement and acquisition strategies; potential further impairment of our goodwill, intangibles and or our long lived assets; the impact of fluctuations in the price of Tyco common shares; risks associated with the change in our Swiss incorporation, including the possibility of reduced flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management, increased or different regulatory burdens, and the possibility that we may not realize anticipated tax benefits; changes in U.S. and non U.S. government laws and regulations; and the possible effects on Tyco of future legislation in the United States that may limit or eliminate potential U.S. tax benefits resulting from Tyco Internationals Swiss incorporation or deny U.S. government contracts to Tyco based upon its Swiss incorporation. 59 Table of Contents  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of conducting business, we are exposed to certain risks associated with potential changes in market conditions. These risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Accordingly, we have established a comprehensive risk management process to monitor, evaluate and manage the principal exposures to which we believe we are subject. We seek to manage these risks through the use of financial derivative instruments. Our portfolio of derivative financial instruments may, from time to time, include forward foreign currency exchange contracts, foreign currency options, interest rate swaps, commodity swaps and forward commodity contracts. Derivative financial instruments related to interest rate sensitivity of debt obligations, intercompany cross border transactions and anticipated non functional currency cash flows are used with the goal of mitigating a significant portion of these exposures when it is cost effective to do so. We do not execute transactions or utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, to reduce the risk that a counterparty will be unable to honor its contractual obligations to us, we only enter into contracts with counterparties having at least an A /A3 long term debt rating. These counterparties are generally financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one party. Foreign Currency Exposures We hedge our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates through the use of forward foreign currency exchange contracts. During 2010, our largest exposures to foreign exchange rates existed primarily with the Swiss franc, British pound, Euro, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. The market risk related to the forward foreign currency exchange contracts (excluding the dividend hedge contract discussed below) is measured by estimating the potential impact of a 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates. The rates used to perform this analysis were based on the market rates in effect on September 24, 2010. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in an immaterial net decrease in the fair value of the contracts. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in an immaterial net increase in the fair value of the contracts. However, gains or losses on these derivative instruments are economically offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. Effective March 17, 2009, Tyco changed its jurisdiction of incorporation from Bermuda to Switzerland. Until the last payment is made in February 2011, Tyco intends to make dividend payments in the form of a reduction of capital denominated in Swiss francs. However, the Company expects to actually pay these dividends in U.S. dollars, based on exchange rates in effect shortly before the payment date. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to the Swiss franc between the date the dividend is declared and paid will increase or decrease the U.S. dollar amount required to be paid. The Company manages the potential variability in cash flows associated with the dividend payments by entering into derivative financial instruments used as economic hedges of the underlying risk. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Swiss franc would result in a $21 million net decrease in the fair value of the contracts. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Swiss franc would result in a $25 million net increase in the fair value of the contracts. However, gains or losses on these derivative instruments are economically offset by the amount of the dividend we would be required to pay. During the third quarter of 2010, Tyco International Finance, S.A. ("TIFSA"), the Companys finance subsidiary, entered into foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge its Euro denominated net investment. The aggregate notional amount of these hedges was approximately $255 million as of September 24, 2010. The potential impact from a 10% appreciation of the U.S. 60 Table of Contents dollar relative to the Euro would result in a $25 million net increase in other comprehensive income. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro would result in a $30 million net decrease in other comprehensive income. As of September 24, 2010, and September 25, 2009 $3.0 billion of intercompany loans have been designated as permanent in nature. For the fiscal years ended September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, we recorded $24 million and nil, respectively, of cumulative translation loss through accumulated other comprehensive loss related to these loans. Interest Rate Exposures Our long term debt portfolio primarily consists of fixed rate instruments. The Company manages its interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swap transactions with financial institutions acting as principal counterparties, which were designated as fair value hedges for accounting purposes. During the third quarter of 2009, first quarter of 2010 and third quarter of 2010, the Company entered into interest rate swap transactions with the objective of managing the exposure to interest rate risk by converting the interest rates on $1.4 billion, $500 million, and $501 million, respectively of fixed rate debt to variable rates. In these contracts, the Company agreed with financial institutions acting as principal counterparties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated on an agreed upon notional principal amount. In connection with the redemption of all of the 6.375% public notes due 2011 during the third quarter of 2010, the Company terminated the corresponding interest rate swaps. As of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, the total gross notional amount of the Companys interest rate swap contracts was $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates as of September 24, 2010 would result in a $37 million net decrease in the fair value of the contracts. Conversely, a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates as of September 24, 2010 would result in a $38 million net increase in the fair value of the contracts. Commodity Exposures We are exposed to volatility in the prices of raw materials used in some of our products and may, in limited circumstances, enter into hedging contracts to manage those exposures. These exposures are monitored as an integral part of our risk management program. During 2010, the Company entered into commodity swaps for copper which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. These swaps did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the price of copper as of September 24, 2010 would not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
