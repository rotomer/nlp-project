Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the Companys financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the Selected Financial Data and our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The Companys actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those under the headings "Risk Factors" and "Forward Looking Information." Introduction The Consolidated Financial Statements include the consolidated results of Tyco International Ltd., a company organized under the laws of Switzerland, and its subsidiaries (hereinafter collectively referred to as "we", the "Company" or "Tyco"). The financial statements have been prepared in United States dollars ("USD"), in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). During the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we realigned our Safety Products segment between our ADT Worldwide and Fire Protection segments to create two new segments: Tyco Security Solutions and Tyco Fire Protection. Tyco Security Solutions consists of the former ADT Worldwide segment as well as the portion of the former Safety Products segment that manufactures security products including intrusion, security, access control and video management systems. Tyco Fire Protection consists of the former Fire Protection Services segment as well as a number of businesses from the former Safety Products segment including the fire suppression, fire detection and life safety products businesses. In addition, various businesses were realigned between Tyco Security Solutions and Tyco Fire Protection. As a result of this realignment, as well as the sale of a majority interest in our Electrical and Metal Products business further described below, we began operating in the following business segments: Tyco Security Solutions designs, sells, installs, services and monitors electronic security, productivity and lifestyle enhancement systems for residential, commercial, industrial and governmental customers. In addition, Tyco Security Solutions designs, manufactures and sells security products including intrusion, security, access control, electronic article surveillance and video management systems. Tyco Fire Protection designs, manufactures, sells, installs and services fire detection and fire suppression systems and building and life safety products for commercial, industrial and governmental customers. Tyco Flow Control designs, manufactures, sells and services valves, pipes, fittings, valve automation and heat tracing products for general process, energy and mining markets as well as the water and wastewater markets. We also provide general corporate services to our segments and these costs are reported as Corporate and Other. Overview Net revenue for the year ended September 30, 2011 increased by $339 million, or 2.0%, to $17.4 billion as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010. Net revenue increased in fiscal 2011 despite the sale of our majority interest in the Electrical and Metal Products business, which contributed $1.4 billion of revenue during the year ended September 24, 2010 and $347 million during the year 36 Table of Contents ended September 30, 2011. Net revenue increased across all of our segments mainly attributable to strength in our Tyco Security Solutions and Tyco Fire Protection segments and to a lesser extent our Tyco Flow Control segment. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates also impacted net revenue by $503 million, or 3.0%. In addition, because the Companys fiscal year ends on the last Friday in September, fiscal 2011 consisted of 53 weeks, as compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2010 and 2009. As a result, fiscal year 2011 includes an estimated $143 million, or 0.8%, of revenue from the additional week. Service revenue, which is primarily recurring in nature, represented approximately 45% of our overall revenue for the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to 41% and 40% for 2010 and 2009, respectively. Service revenue as a percentage of net revenue increased due to the divestiture of our Electrical and Metal Products business, which did not have a significant service component as well as due to strength in our Tyco Security Solutions and Tyco Fire Protection businesses. Service revenues are principally derived from our Tyco Security Solutions and Tyco Fire Protection businesses, and represent a consistent source of revenue from monitoring and maintenance services under contractual agreements. Recurring revenue in our Tyco Security Solutions business grew to approximately 57% of Tyco Security Solutions total revenue for the year ended September 30, 2011 which is primarily due to the integration of Broadview Security, compared to approximately 56% for the year ended September 24, 2010, and 52% for the year ended September 25, 2009. In the Tyco Fire Protection business, service revenue remained steady as a percentage of Tyco Fire Protections total revenue at 38% in 2011 and 2010, as compared to 36% in 2009. For the year ended September 30, 2011, non service revenue in Tyco Security Solutions and Tyco Fire Protection improved slightly compared to the prior annual periods, due to strength in systems installation and related products and product sales in Tyco Security Solutions and product sales in Tyco Fire Protection. These improvements were partially offset by continued weakness in our Tyco Flow Control segments Water and Environmental Systems business. Operating income for the year ended September 30, 2011 increased $521 million, or 33%, to $2.1 billion, as compared to operating income of $1.6 billion for the year ended September 24, 2010. Operating income for the year ended September 30, 2011 includes a net gain on divestitures of $230 million primarily related to the sale of a majority interest in our Electrical and Metal products business compared to a net gain on divestitures of $40 million for the year ended September 24, 2010. Operating income was also favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $60 million, or 3.8%. The increase in operating income in 2011 also reflects strong growth in our Tyco Security Solutions business. Operating income was favorably impacted for the year ended September 30, 2011 due to lower restructuring and asset impairment charges of $87 million as compared to $145 million for the year ended September 24, 2010. Operating income for the year ended September 30, 2011 included acquisition and integration costs of $39 million as compared to $35 million for the year ended September 24, 2010. Our cash balance was $1.4 billion and $1.8 billion as of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively. We generated approximately $2.4 billion of cash from operating activities and utilized $1.3 billion of cash in investing activities and $1.5 billion of cash in financing activities during the year ended September 30, 2011. During the year ended September 30, 2011, approximately $1.0 billion of cash was generated from divestitures, primarily related to $713 million for the sale of the majority interest in our Electrical and Metal Products business and $264 million for the sale of our European water business, which was presented in net cash provided by (used in) discontinued investing activities in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. During the year ended September 30, 2011, uses of cash primarily included $1.3 billion to repurchase our common shares, $788 million of capital expenditures, $656 million for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, $614 million to purchase customer contracts in our Tyco Security Solutions segment and $458 million to pay cash dividends. 37 Table of Contents Recent Transactions On September 19, 2011, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a plan to separate the Company into three separate, publicly traded companies consisting of the Companys North American residential security business, its flow control business, and its commercial fire and security business. The 2012 Separation is expected to be completed by the end of the third calendar quarter of 2012 through a tax free pro rata distribution of all of the equity interest in the flow control and North American residential security business. Completion of the proposed separation is subject to certain conditions, including final approval by the Tyco Board of Directors and shareholders, receipt of tax opinions and rulings and the filing and effectiveness of registration statements with the SEC. The separation will also be subject to the completion of any necessary financing. During fiscal 2011, we made a number of strategic investments within our three core businesses. On April 29, 2011, our Tyco Security Solutions segment completed the acquisition of Signature Security Group for $184 million, net of cash acquired of $2 million. Signature Security Group is an electronic security company operating in Australia and New Zealand primarily in small business and residential markets. On June 29, 2011, the Companys Flow Control segment finalized the acquisition of a 75% equity interest in privately held KEF Holdings Ltd. ("KEF"), a vertically integrated valve manufacturer in the Middle East, for approximately $295 million, net of cash acquired of $1 million. Additionally, in connection with the acquisition we acquired $64 million of debt which was substantially paid as of September 30, 2011. On September 1, 2011, our Fire Protection segment completed the acquisition of Chemguard Inc. ("Chemguard") for approximately $130 million, net of cash acquired of $1 million. Chemguard is a provider of firefighting foam concentrates and equipment, foam systems, services and specialty chemicals. On September 15, 2011, the Company reached an agreement to acquire Visonic Ltd. ("Visonic"), a global developer and manufacturer of electronic security systems and components, for approximately $100 million in cash. The transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Following the close of the transaction, the Company intends to combine Visonic with the Companys Tyco Security Solutions segment. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements On November 9, 2010, we announced that we entered into an investment agreement (the "Agreement") to sell a majority interest in our Electrical and Metal Products business to an affiliate of the private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC (the "Investor"). We formed a newly incorporated holding company, Atkore International Group Inc. ("Atkore"), to hold our Electrical and Metal Products business. On December 22, 2010, the transaction closed and the Investor acquired shares of a newly created class of cumulative convertible preferred stock of Atkore (the "Preferred Stock"). The Preferred Stock initially represented 51% of the outstanding capital stock (on an as converted basis) of Atkore. In connection with the closing, we received cash proceeds of approximately $713 million and recorded a gain of $259 million during the first quarter of 2011. During the year ended September 30, 2011, we recorded working capital adjustments of $11 million that reduced the gain on disposal. The gain on disposal is recorded within restructuring, asset impairments and divestiture (gains) charges, net in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. On September 30, 2010, we sold our water business in Europe, which was part of our Tyco Flow Control segment. The business met the discontinued operations criteria and has been included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. The sale was completed for approximately $264 million in cash proceeds, net of $7 million of cash divested on sale, and a pre tax gain of $172 million, which was largely exempt from tax. The gain was recorded in income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations. References to the segment data are to the Companys continuing operations. As discussed above, the Company realigned certain business operations during the first quarter of fiscal 2011 and 38 Table of Contents accordingly has recast prior period segment amounts.

Segment Results The segment discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in results for each of our segments included in continuing operations. 39 Table of Contents Tyco Security Solutions Net Revenue Net revenue for Tyco Security Solutions for the years ended September 30, 2011, September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009 were as follows ($ in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Service revenue Recurring $ 4,907 $ 4,295 $ 3,861 Non recurring 729 709 951 Total service revenue 5,636 5,004 4,812 (1) Revenue from product sales (non recurring) System installation and related products 2,584 2,377 2,255 Security products 406 353 308 Total revenue from product sales 2,990 2,730 2,563 (1) Net revenue $ 8,626 $ 7,734 $ 7,375 (1)As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, revenue related to the sale of electronic tags and labels utilized in retailer anti theft systems is classified as revenue from product sales. In reporting periods prior to the first quarter of fiscal 2010, revenue related to the sale of electronic tags and labels utilized in retailer anti theft systems was misclassified as service revenue. Such item had no effect on net revenue, operating income (loss), net income (loss) and cash flows. No changes have been made to previously filed financial statements or in the comparative amounts presented herein, as the effect in prior periods is not material. Revenue related to the sale of such electronic tags and labels reflected as service revenue was $286 million in 2009 and related cost of services was $176 million in 2009. Net revenue for Tyco Security Solutions of $8.6 billion increased by $892 million, or 11.5%, during the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010. Net revenue was favorably impacted by the estimated net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of $235 million, or 3.0%, substantially all of which was related to the acquisition of Broadview Security in May 2010, and to a lesser extent, Signature Security Group in April 2011, offset by divested revenue from our French Security business which was sold in March 2010. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates also favorably impacted net revenue by $192 million, or 2.5%. In addition, an estimated $38 million, or 0.5%, of revenue is attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2011, all of which is non recurring. The remaining increase in net revenue was primarily due to incremental account growth, net of attrition, in the recurring revenue businesses in North America and Rest of World ("ROW"), and strength in our non recurring businesses related to construction project activity and security system upgrades in North America and retail store expansion activity in ROW. Net revenue for Tyco Security Solutions of $7.7 billion increased by $359 million, or 4.9%, during the year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to September 25, 2009. Net revenue was favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $239 million, or 3.2%. Net revenue was also favorably impacted by the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of $72 million, or 1.0%, which was primarily the result of $193 million in net revenue estimated to be contributed by the Broadview Security acquisition partially offset by $109 million of divested revenue relating to our French security business. 40 Table of Contents Recurring Net Revenue Recurring revenue is generated from contractual monitoring and maintenance agreements that are long term in nature, and is primarily driven by the addition or loss of customer accounts and increases or decreases in average revenue per customer. For the Years Ended September 30, 2011 September 24, 2010 September 25, 2009 Number of customer accounts(1) 9.0 million 8.9 million 7.4 million Trailing 52 week attrition(1)(2) 12.6% 12.8% 13.3% Average monthly revenue per customer(1) $45.35 $44.62 $45.81 (1)The number of customer accounts, attrition rates and average revenue per customer for all periods exclude the impact of divestitures. (2)Trailing 52 week attrition rates exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Recurring revenue increased by $612 million, or 14.2%, to approximately $4.9 billion during the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010. Recurring net revenue was favorably impacted by the estimated impact of acquisitions and divestitures of $322 million, or 7.5%, relating to our acquisition of Broadview Security in May 2010, and to a lesser extent the acquisition of Signature Security Group in April 2011. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates also favorably impacted recurring revenue by $84 million, or 2.0%. Customer accounts grew during the year ended September 30, 2011 by approximately 0.1 million, or 1.1%, to a total of 9.0 million accounts. The increase in average monthly revenue per customer of $0.73 from the year ended September 24, 2010 to the year ended September 30, 2011 was partially due to favorable foreign exchange rates along with incremental account growth, net of attrition, in the North America and ROW regions. Recurring revenue increased by $434 million, or 11.2%, to approximately $4.3 billion, during the year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to the year ended September 25, 2009, as a result of growth in customer accounts of approximately 1.5 million, or 20.3%, to a total of approximately 8.9 million accounts as of September 24, 2010. Approximately 1.4 million customer accounts were acquired on May 14, 2010 in connection with the Broadview Security acquisition. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted recurring revenue by $149 million, or 3.9%, and $116 million, or 3.0%, respectively, in 2010. Non Recurring Net Revenue Non recurring revenue is generated from product sales (including sales and installation of electronic security and products related to retailer anti theft systems, as well as other life safety systems) and from services such as the provisioning of armored guards and one time repair, security system upgrades or inspection jobs. Non recurring net revenue increased by $280 million, or 8.1%, to $3.7 billion for the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted non recurring net revenue by $108 million, or 3.1%. In addition, an estimated $38 million, or 1.1%, of non recurring revenue is attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2011. These increases were partially offset by an unfavorable net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of $89 million or 2.6%, primarily relating to the sale of our French Security business in March 2010. The remaining increase was primarily due to strength in commercial end markets with new retail store expansion activity in ROW and increased demand within North America for construction projects and security systems upgrades. 41 Table of Contents Non recurring revenue declined by $75 million, or 2.1%, to approximately $3.4 billion during the year ended September 24, 2010, as compared to the year ended September 25, 2009, due to lower sales volume primarily as the result of weakness in the commercial end market, which declined at a slower rate than the same period in the prior year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted systems installation, product sales and other service revenue by $122 million, or 3.5%, while the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures resulted in an unfavorable impact of $76 million, or 2.2%. Revenue by Geography North American revenue consists of residential and small business, primarily a recurring revenue business, and commercial, primarily a non recurring revenue business. Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") and ROW revenue are primarily commercial. Net revenue by geography for Tyco Security Solutions was as follows ($in millions): 2011 2010 2009 North America $ 5,102 $ 4,436 $ 4,185 Europe, Middle East and Africa 1,726 1,738 1,875 Rest of World 1,392 1,207 1,007 Tyco Security Products(1) 406 353 308 Net revenue $ 8,626 $ 7,734 $ 7,375 (1)Tyco Security Products is managed as a global business. North America Net revenue in North America increased by $666 million, or 15.0%, for the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Broadview Security. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted North American revenue by $25 million, or 0.6%. Residential and small business net revenue increased by 19.9% compared to the year ended September 24, 2010, primarily due to the acquisition of Broadview Security. Commercial net revenue increased by 8.2%, as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010, primarily as a result of an increase in construction projects and security system upgrades in the commercial end markets which was partially offset by softness in the retail market. Net revenue in North America increased by $251 million, or 6.0%, for the year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to the year ended September 25, 2009, primarily as the result of the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, which favorably impacted net revenue by an estimated $193 million, or 4.6%, as the result of the acquisition of Broadview Security. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates also favorably impacted net revenue by $48 million, or 1.1%. Residential and small business net revenue increased by 15.3% compared to the year ended September 25, 2010, primarily due to the acquisition of Broadview Security. Commercial net revenue decreased by 4.8% due to the decline in systems installation and product sales as the result of weakness in the commercial market, although the rate of decline was slower than the same period in the prior year. Europe, Middle East, and Africa Net revenue in EMEA decreased by $12 million, or 0.7%, for the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010, primarily due to the unfavorable net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of $138 million, or 7.9%, resulting from the sale of certain businesses, including the French security business in March 2010, and several smaller businesses in Europe over the course of fiscal 2010. The decrease was partially offset by favorable changes in foreign currency 42 Table of Contents exchange rates of $70 million, or 4.0%. Stronger systems installation across Continental Europe also favorably increased net revenue. Net revenue in EMEA decreased by $137 million, or 7.3%, for the year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to the year ended September 25, 2009, as favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $60 million, or 3.2%, were more than offset by a decline in systems installation and other service revenue as a result of weakness in the commercial end market, although the rate of decline was slower than the same period in the prior year. Additionally, EMEA net revenue was unfavorably impacted by $120 million, or 6.4%, due to the impact of divestitures. Rest of World Net revenue in ROW increased by $185 million, or 15.3%, for the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net revenue by $83 million, or 6.9%. The remaining increase in net revenue in ROW was primarily attributable to retail store expansion, increases in the customer account bases and increased systems installation activity in the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions. Net revenue in ROW increased by $200 million, or 19.9%, for the year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to the year ended September 25, 2009, primarily due to recurring revenue growth in both Latin American and Asia Pacific regions resulting from customer account growth. The Asia Pacific region experienced an increase in system installation, products sales and other service revenue which was partially offset by a decrease in the Latin American region due to a slowdown in commercial and retailer end markets. Net revenue in the Rest of World geographies was also favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $111 million, or 11.0%. Tyco Security Products Net revenue in Tyco Security Products increased by $53 million, or 15.0%, for the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net revenue by $14 million, or 4.0%. The remaining increase in net revenue was primarily due to growth across multiple product lines globally. Net revenue in Tyco Security Products increased by $45 million, or 14.6%, for the year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to the year ended September 25, 2009. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net revenue by $20 million, or 6.5%. Additionally, net revenue increased due to higher volume primarily related to the introduction of several new products. Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income and operating margin for Tyco Security Solutions were as follows ($ in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Operating income $ 1,361 $ 1,090 $ (514 ) Operating margin 15.8 % 14.1 % %(1) (1)Certain operating margins and percentages have not been presented as management believes such calculations are not meaningful. 43  Table of Contents Operating income of $1.4 billion increased by $271 million, or 24.9%, in the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended September 30, 2011 continued to be favorably impacted by higher sales volume, efficiencies gained through restructuring actions taken in prior years and other cost containment activities. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted operating income by $23 million, or 2.1%. Included in operating income for the year ended September 30, 2011 was $25 million of restructuring charges, net as compared to $62 million of restructuring charges, net for the year ended September 24, 2010. In addition, included in operating income for the year ended September 30, 2011 is $33 million of acquisition and integration costs primarily related to the acquisition of Broadview Security and Signature Security Group, as compared to $32 million of acquisition and integration costs during the year ended September 24, 2010. Included in the operating income for the prior year comparable period is a $45 million gain on divestitures, net primarily related to the sale of our French security business and a curtailment gain of $12 million, which was recognized upon the freezing of certain defined benefit plans in the United Kingdom, as compared to the absence of similar charges for the year ended September 30, 2011. Operating income of $1.1 billion increased by $1.6 billion in the year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to the year ended September 25, 2009. Operating income for the year ended September 25, 2009 was negatively affected by goodwill impairment charges of $1.3 billion recorded at our ADT EMEA, Access Controls and Video Systems ("ACVS") and Sensormatic Retail Solutions reporting units and intangible asset impairment charges of $64 million. Operating income for the year ended September 24, 2010 was positively impacted by the shift to higher margin recurring revenue. Additionally, 2010 operating income was favorably impacted by the net impact of savings realized through previous restructuring and cost containment actions, and a curtailment gain of $12 million recognized when certain defined benefit pension plans were frozen in the United Kingdom. These increases were partially offset by an increase in the amortization of intangible assets primarily relating to the Broadview Security acquisition. During the year ended September 24, 2010, $62 million of net restructuring charges were incurred, of which $14 million related to restructuring actions associated with the acquisition of Broadview Security, as compared to $118 million of restructuring charges, net during the year ended September 25, 2009. Additionally, management estimated that $2 million of additional charges resulting from restructuring actions was incurred during the year ended September 25, 2009. Fiscal 2010 also included a $45 million gain on divestitures, net primarily related to the sale of our French security business, and $32 million of acquisition and integration costs related to the acquisition of Broadview Security, as compared to a $6 million loss on divestitures and nil of acquisition costs during fiscal 2009. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted operating income by $33 million, or 6.4%. 44 Table of Contents Tyco Fire Protection Net Revenue Net revenue for Tyco Fire Protection for the years ended September 30, 2011, September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009 were as follows ($ in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Revenue from product sales Systems installation and related products $ 1,617 $ 1,621 (1) $ 1,744 (1) Products 1,320 1,156 1,206 Total revenue from products sales $ 2,937 $ 2,777 $ 2,950 Service revenue 1,806 1,733 (1) 1,670 (1) Net revenue $ 4,743 $ 4,510 $ 4,620 (1)Revenue related to the sale of certain products is classified as revenue from product sales. In reporting periods prior to the first quarter of fiscal 2011, revenue related to certain systems installation products was misclassified as service revenue. The service revenue and systems installation revenue during the years ended September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009 have not been changed for this misclassification, as the effect is not material. The impact of the misclassification for the years ended September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009 would have been to decrease service revenue by $37 million and $36 million, respectively, with a corresponding increase to systems installation within revenue from product sales. If the revenue from the sale of these products during the years ended September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009 were classified as product sales, service revenue would have increased $110 million, or 6.5% for the year ended September 30, 2011, and $62 million, or 3.8% for the year ended September 24, 2010. In addition, product sales would have increased by $123 million, or 4.4% for the year ended September 30, 2011, and decreased $172 million, or 5.8% for the year ended September 24, 2010. Net revenue for Tyco Fire Protection of $4.7 billion increased by $233 million, or 5.2%, during the year ended September 30, 2011, as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net revenue by $126 million, or 2.8%. In addition, an estimated $60 million, or 1.3% of revenue is attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2011, while the deconsolidation of a joint venture in our Fire Protection services business as a result of adopting a new accounting standard unfavorably impacted net revenue by $72 million, or 1.6%. The remaining increase in revenue was primarily driven by increased volume in product sales as a result of generally improved end market demand, implementation of pricing actions to offset commodity inflationary pressures, increased services revenue as a result of continued focus on driving recurring revenue and continued emerging markets expansion, partially offset by a decline in systems installation revenue as a result of project selectivity across all regions. Net revenue for Tyco Fire Protection decreased $110 million, or 2.4%, during the year ended September 24, 2010 compared to the year ended September 25, 2009. Net revenue was unfavorably impacted by acquisitions and divestitures of $37 million, or 0.8%. Net revenue was favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $130 million, or 2.8%. The remaining decrease was primarily due to weakness in commercial markets and project selectivity resulting from a focus on higher margin projects. 45 Table of Contents Revenue from product sales Systems installation and related products Revenue from product sales includes sales and installation of fire protection and other systems. Revenue from systems installation decreased by $4 million, or 0.2%, during the year ended September 30, 2011, as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted systems installation revenue by $45 million, or 2.8%, while the deconsolidation of a joint venture discussed above unfavorably impacted systems installation by $51 million, or 3.1%. Revenue from systems installation was also unfavorably impacted by project selectivity resulting from a focus on higher margin projects across all regions. Revenue from systems installation decreased by $123 million, or 7.1%, during the year ended September 24, 2010, as compared to the year ended September 25, 2009. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted systems installation revenue by $56 million, or 3.2%. Despite the favorable impact of foreign currency, revenue decreased due to decreased upgrade activity from customers, and project selectivity resulting from a focus on higher margin project across all regions. Product sales Revenue from product sales increased by $164 million, or 14.2%, during the year ended September 30, 2011, as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted product revenue by $24 million, or 2.1%. The remaining increase in net revenue was driven by increased volumes due to improved end market demand and implementation of pricing actions to offset commodity inflationary pressures. Revenue from product sales decreased by $50 million, or 4.1%, during the year ended September 24, 2010, as compared to the year ended September 25, 2009. Product revenue was unfavorably impacted by the estimated impact of $32 million, or 2.7% of divestitures. This decrease was partially offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates which favorably impacted product revenue by $13 million, or 1.1%. The remaining decrease was due to weakness in end market demand. Service revenue Service revenue consists of inspection, maintenance, monitoring and repair of fire detection, suppression and other life safety systems. Service revenue increased by $73 million, or 4.2%, during the year ended September 30, 2011, as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted service revenue by $56 million, or 3.2%, while the deconsolidation of a joint venture discussed above unfavorably impacted service revenue by $21 million, or 1.2%. The remaining increase in service revenue was as a result of managements continued focus on expanding our recurring service revenue across all regions. Service revenue increased by $63 million, or 3.8%, during the year ended September 24, 2010, as compared to the year ended September 25, 2009. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted service revenue by $61 million, or 3.7%. Despite the favorable impact of foreign currency, service revenue was flat due primarily to weakness in the European markets. Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income and operating margin for Tyco Fire Protection were as follows ($ in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Operating income $ 534 $ 460 $ 20 Operating margin 11.3 % 10.2 % (1) (1)Certain operating margins and percentages have not been presented as management believes such calculations are not meaningful. 46 Table of Contents Operating income of $534 million increased $74 million, or 16.1%, for the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted operating income by $15 million, or 3.3%. Other factors that contributed to the net increase in operating income and operating margin were increased sales volume, implementation of pricing actions to offset commodity inflationary pressures in the products business, project selectivity in the systems installation business, and cost containment initiatives. These increases were partially offset by additional environmental remediation costs of $11 million, net of recoveries related to an isolated site, and a $5 million decrease to operating income related to the deconsolidation of a joint venture. Included in operating income for the prior year comparable period is a curtailment gain of $8 million, which was recognized upon the freezing of certain defined benefit plans in the United Kingdom. Included in operating income for the year ended September 30, 2011 was $38 million of restructuring charges, net as compared to $42 million of restructuring charges, net for the year ended September 24, 2010. Included in operating income for the year ended September 30, 2011 was $29 million of losses on divestitures as compared to $2 million of losses on divestitures for the year ended September 24, 2010. Operating income increased $440 million during the year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to the year ended September 25, 2009. Operating income during the year ended September 25, 2009 was negatively affected by a goodwill impairment charge of $420 million recorded at the EMEA Fire and Life Safety reporting units. Additionally, operating income in 2010 was favorably impacted by savings realized through cost containment actions, $14 million of favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and to a lesser extent, a curtailment gain of approximately $8 million recognized when certain defined benefit pension plans were frozen in the United Kingdom. There were $42 million of restructuring charges, net and a loss on divestiture of $2 million during the year ended September 24, 2010, compared with $62 million of restructuring charges, net and nil of divestiture charges incurred in 2009. Additionally, management estimates that $7 million of additional charges resulting from restructuring actions were incurred during 2009. Operating income in 2009 was also unfavorably affected by the decreased sales volume discussed above. Tyco Flow Control Net Revenue Net revenue for Tyco Flow Control for the years ended September 30, 2011, September 24, 2010, and September 25, 2009 were as follows ($ in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Revenue from product sales $ 3,330 $ 3,089 $ 3,232 Service revenue 309 284 263 Net revenue $ 3,639 $ 3,373 $ 3,495 Net revenue for Tyco Flow Control of $3.6 billion increased by $266 million, or 7.9%, during the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010. The increase in revenue was primarily due to favorable impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $183 million, or 5.4%. In addition, an estimated $45 million, or 1.3%, of revenue is attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2011. Net revenue was favorably impacted by the estimated net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of $7 million, or 0.2%. The remaining increase was primarily due to continued strength in end market demand in our Valves and Controls and Thermal Controls businesses partially offset by weakness in our Water and Environmental Systems business. The decreased revenue in our Water and Environmental Systems business was primarily due to the completion of a large desalinization project in Australia that commenced during the second quarter of fiscal 2010, and was completed at the beginning of the second quarter fiscal 2011. 47 Table of Contents Net revenue for Tyco Flow Control of $3.4 billion decreased by $122 million, or 3.5%, during the year ended year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to the year ended September 25, 2009. Net revenue was favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $218 million, or 6.2%, as well as the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of $10 million, or 0.3%. This was more than offset by decreased revenues due to reduced volume in the Valves and Controls business driven by decreased demand in end markets. Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income and operating margin for Tyco Flow Control for the years ended September 30, 2011, September 24, 2010, and September 25, 2009 were as follows ($ in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Operating income $ 413 $ 410 $ 496 Operating margin 11.3 % 12.2 % 14.2 % Operating income of $413 million increased by $3 million, or 0.7%, in the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010. Operating income was favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $22 million, or 5.4%. The increase in operating income was primarily due to continued strength in the Valves and Controls and Thermal Controls businesses, which was more than offset by weakness in our Water and Environmental Systems business. Restructuring charges, net were $11 million during the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to $25 million in the prior year. The year ended September 30, 2011 included a $6 million gain on divestiture, compared to a $1 million gain on divestiture for the year ended September 24, 2010. Operating income of $410 million decreased by $86 million, or 17.3%, during the year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to the year ended September 25, 2009, primarily due to decreased volume in our valves business and an expected loss related to completion of a long term construction project of approximately $18 million. These declines were partially offset by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $31 million, or 6.3%. The decline in operating income was also partially offset by savings realized through cost containment and restructuring actions. Operating income was unfavorably impacted by $24 million of restructuring and divestiture charges, net during both fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009. Additionally, management estimated that $5 million of additional charges resulting from restructuring actions were incurred during the year ended September 25, 2009. Corporate and Other Corporate expense decreased $266 million, or 57.6%, to $196 million for the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to an expense of $462 million for the year ended September 24, 2010. The decrease in corporate expense during the year ended September 30, 2011 is related to a $253 million net gain on divestitures, primarily related to the divestiture of our Electrical and Metal Products business, compared to a $4 million net loss on divestitures during the year ended September 24, 2010. Corporate expense was also favorably impacted by cost containment initiatives during the year ended September 30, 2011, as well as a lower net asbestos charge of $11 million recorded in connection with the Companys valuation of its asbestos related liabilities during the year ended September 30, 2011 compared to a $52 million, net asbestos charge recorded during the year ended September 24, 2010. Corporate also recorded a $20 million charge in relation to a legacy legal matter during the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to nil during the year ended September 24, 2010. Additionally, net restructuring charges and acquisition charges for the year ended September 30, 2011 were $12 million and $1 million respectively, while the year ended September 24, 2010 included restructuring charges and acquisition charges of $1 million and $3 million, respectively. The year ended September 30, 2011 included $24 million of separation costs primarily related to 48 Table of Contents professional fees and banking services. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Corporate expense decreased $108 million, or 18.9%, to $462 million for year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to $570 million for the year ended September 25, 2009. Corporate expense during 2009 was negatively affected by approximately $125 million of charges related to legacy securities matters partially offset by a $16 million benefit related to a settlement reached with a former executive. Restructuring charges decreased to $1 million for the year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to $10 million in the year ended September 25, 2009. Corporate expense was also favorably impacted by savings realized through cost containment and restructuring charges. These decreases in Corporate expenses were partially offset by a $52 million net asbestos charge recorded during the third quarter of 2010 as compared to a $37 million net asbestos charge in 2009, both of which were recorded in conjunction with the valuation of our asbestos related liabilities and insurance assets. In addition, $4 million of divestiture charges, net, and $3 million of acquisition costs were recorded during the year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to $6 million of divestiture charges, net, and nil of acquisition costs for the year ended September 25, 2009. Interest Income and Expense Interest income was $34 million in 2011, as compared to $31 million and $44 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Interest income increased in 2011 primarily due to increased investment yields compared to 2010, while investment yields continue to be lower than those experienced in 2009. Interest expense was $244 million in 2011, as compared to $284 million and $301 million in 2010 and in 2009, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on total debt outstanding as of September 30, 2011, September 24, 2010, September 25, 2009 was 5.9%, 6.3% and 6.6%, respectively. The decreases in interest expense and weighted average interest rate are primarily related to savings realized from the replacement of higher coupon notes with lower coupon notes over the past year, including the redemption of 6.375% notes due 2011 and issuance of 3.375% notes due 2015 during the third quarter of 2010 and the maturity of 6.75% notes due 2011 and issuances of the 3.75% notes due 2018 and 4.625% notes due 2023 during the second quarter of 2011. Other Expense, Net Other expense, net of $16 million in 2011, primarily relates to our share of Atkores net loss of $9 million, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting, and a decrease in the receivables due from Covidien and TE Connectivity under the Tax Sharing Agreement of $7 million. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other expense, net of $75 million in 2010, primarily related to a charge of $87 million as a loss on extinguishment of debt on the redemption of our 6.375% public notes due 2011, 7% notes due 2028 and 6.875% notes due 2029. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This loss was partially offset by an $8 million gain recorded as a result of an increase in the receivables due from Covidien and TE Connectivity under the Tax Sharing Agreement. Other expense, net of $7 million in 2009, primarily related to a $14 million charge recorded as a result of a decrease in the receivables due from Covidien and TE Connectivity under the Tax Sharing Agreement, which was partially offset by income of $5 million relating to a gain on derivative contracts used to economically hedge the foreign currency risk related to the Swiss franc denominated dividends. Effective Income Tax Rate Our effective income tax rate was 17.2% and 10.9% during the years ended September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively. The increase in our effective income tax rate was primarily 49 Table of Contents related to the tax charge recorded in conjunction with the sale of a majority interest in our Electrical and Metal Products business during the first quarter of 2011, a non recurring transaction generating a tax benefit in 2010 and a release of a deferred tax valuation allowance in 2010. The effective income tax rate was positively impacted by favorable audit resolutions in multiple jurisdictions during 2011. The rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to discrete items such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, as well as recurring factors, such as the geographic mix of income before taxes. The effective income tax rate for 2009 is not meaningful primarily as a result of the loss driven by goodwill impairment charges of $2.6 billion for which almost no tax benefit was available. Additionally, taxes for 2009 were positively impacted by increased profitability in lower tax rate jurisdictions and release of contingency reserves partially offset by enacted tax law changes and changes in foreign exchange rates that negatively impacted the non U.S. deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $1,400 million and $1,379 million as of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. The valuation allowance was calculated and recorded when the Company determined that it was more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets would not be realized. The Company believes that it will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as payment is not expected within one year. 2009 Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairments Annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, and more frequently if triggering events occur, we test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible assets with its carrying amount. We began to experience a decline in revenue during the first quarter of 2009 in our Tyco Security Solutions and Tyco Fire Protection segments as a result of a slowdown in the commercial markets, including the retailer end market as well as a decline in sales volume at our Electrical Metal Products segments. Although we considered and concluded that these factors did not constitute triggering events during the first quarter of 2009, the continued existence of these conditions during the second quarter of 2009, along with downward revisions to forecasted results, restructuring actions and weaker industry outlooks, caused us to conclude that sufficient indicators of impairment existed. Reporting units within our Tyco Security Solutions and Tyco Fire Protection segments continued to be negatively impacted as a result of a slowdown in the commercial markets including the retailer end market. Additionally, our Electrical Metal Products reporting unit continued to be negatively impacted by a decline in sales volume due to the downturn in the non residential construction market. We determined that these underlying events and circumstances constituted triggering events for six reporting units where such events would more likely than not reduce the fair value below their respective carrying amounts. Specifically, we concluded that our EMEA Security, ACVS and Sensormatic Retail Solutions ("SRS") reporting units within the Tyco Security Solutions segment the EMEA Fire and Life Safety reporting units within the Tyco Fire Protection segment and our Electrical and Metal Products reporting unit 50 Table of Contents within the Electrical and Metal Products segment experienced triggering events such that the carrying values of these reporting units likely exceeded their fair values. Furthermore, we determined that certain indefinite lived intangible assets required impairment testing based on the underlying events and circumstances described as well as the continued deterioration of the business environment related to the retailer end market of our Tyco Security Solutions segments. As a result of the triggering events, we performed long lived asset, goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests for these reporting units and certain of our trade names and franchise rights. Fair value of each reporting unit was determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on forecast cash flows (including underlying revenue and operating income growth rates) discounted using an estimated weighted average cost of capital of market participants. In determining fair value, management relied on and considered a number of factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections including the timing for an economic recovery, cash flow forecasts, market data, and our overall market capitalization. Based on the factors described above, actual and anticipated reductions in demand for the reporting units products and services as well as increased risk due to economic uncertainty, the estimates of future cash flows used in the second quarter of 2009 discounted cash flow analyses were revised downward from our most recent test conducted during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2008. Furthermore, the range of the weighted average cost of capital utilized was increased to reflect increased risk due to economic volatility and uncertainties related to demand for our products and services. The results of the goodwill impairment tests indicated that the implied goodwill amount was less than the carrying amount of goodwill for each of the aforementioned reporting units. We recorded an aggregate non cash impairment charge of $2.6 billion ($2.6 billion after tax) during the second quarter of 2009. The non cash impairment charge was recorded in goodwill and intangible asset impairments in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the quarter ended March 27, 2009. Indefinite lived intangible assets consisting primarily of trade names and franchise rights were tested for impairment using either a relief from royalty method or excess earnings method, which include the selection of appropriate discount rates, royalty rates and terminal year growth rate assumptions and estimates of the amount and timing of future cash flows attributable to the underlying intangible assets. Also, during the second quarter of 2009, our estimates of future cash flows used in determining the fair value of our Tyco Security Solutions segment Sensormatic tradename as well as certain Tyco Security Solutions segment franchise rights were revised downward relative to the estimates used in our tests during the fourth quarter of 2008. The results of the impairment test indicated that the Tyco Security Solutions Sensormatic tradename and Tyco Security Solutions franchise rights estimated fair values were less than their respective carrying amounts. As a result, we recorded an aggregate non cash impairment charge of $64 million ($40 million after tax) during the second quarter of 2009. The non cash impairment charge was recorded in goodwill and intangible asset impairments in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the quarter ended March 27, 2009.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. Depreciation and Amortization Methods for Security Monitoring Related Assets Tyco considers assets related to the acquisition of new customers in its electronic security business in three asset categories: internally generated residential subscriber systems, internally generated commercial subscriber systems (collectively referred to as subscriber system assets) and customer accounts acquired through the ADT dealer program (referred to as dealer intangibles). Subscriber system assets include installed property, 51 Table of Contents plant and equipment for which Tyco retains ownership and deferred costs directly related to the customer acquisition and system installation. Subscriber system assets and any deferred revenue resulting from the customer acquisition are accounted for over the expected life of the subscriber. In certain geographical areas where the Company has a large number of customers that behave in a similar manner over time, the Company accounts for subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue using pools, with separate pools for the components of subscriber system assets and any related deferred revenue based on the month and year of acquisition. The Company depreciates its pooled subscriber system assets (primarily in North America) and related deferred revenue using an accelerated method with lives up to 15 years. The accelerated method utilizes declining balance rates based on geographical area ranging from 160% to 265% for residential subscriber pools and 135% to 360% for commercial subscriber pools and converts to a straight line methodology when the resulting depreciation charge is greater than that from the accelerated method. The Company uses a straight line method with a 14 year life for non pooled subscriber system assets (primarily in Europe and Asia) and related deferred revenue, with remaining balances written off upon customer termination. Revenue Recognition Contract sales for the installation of fire protection systems, large security intruder systems and other construction related projects are recorded primarily under the percentage of completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related total cost of the project at completion. The risk of this methodology is its dependence upon estimates of costs at completion, which are subject to the uncertainties inherent in long term contracts. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they become determinable. Sales of security monitoring systems may have multiple elements, including equipment, installation, monitoring services and maintenance agreements. We assess our revenue arrangements to determine the appropriate units of accounting. When ownership of the system is transferred to the customer, each deliverable provided under the arrangement is considered a separate unit of accounting. Revenues associated with sale of equipment and related installations are recognized once delivery, installation and customer acceptance is completed, while the revenue for monitoring and maintenance services are recognized as services are rendered. Amounts assigned to each unit of accounting are based on an allocation of total arrangement consideration using a hierarchy of estimated selling price for the deliverables. The selling price used for each deliverable will be based on Vendor Specific Objective Evidence ("VSOE") if available, Third Party Evidence ("TPE") if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price if neither VSOE or TPE is available. Revenue recognized for equipment and installation is limited to the lesser of their allocated amounts under the estimated selling price hierarchy or the non contingent up front consideration received at the time of installation, since collection of future amounts under the arrangement with the customer is contingent upon the delivery of monitoring and maintenance services. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience and trend analysis. Loss Contingencies Accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings, self insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on judgment, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates. Additionally, the Company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. Asbestos Related Contingencies and Insurance Receivables We and certain of our subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials. We estimate the liability and corresponding insurance recovery for pending and future claims and defense costs predominantly based on claim experience 52 Table of Contents over the past five years, and a projection which covers claims expected to be filed, including related defense costs, over the next seven years on an undiscounted basis. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the pattern and length of time over which claims will be made and then settled or litigated, we use multiple estimation methodologies based on varying scenarios of potential outcomes to estimate the range of loss. We have concluded that estimating the liability beyond the seven year period will not provide a reasonable estimate, as these uncertainties increase significantly as the projection period lengthens. In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are probable. The estimate of asbestos related insurance recoveries represents estimated amounts due to us for previously paid and settled claims and the probable reimbursements relating to estimated liability for pending and future claims. In determining the amount of insurance recoverable, we consider available insurance, allocation methodologies, solvency and creditworthiness of the insurers. Annually, we perform a detailed analysis with the assistance of outside legal counsel and other experts to review and update as appropriate the underlying assumptions used in the estimated asbestos related assets and liabilities. On a quarterly basis, we re evaluate the assumptions used to perform the annual analysis and record an expense as necessary to reflect changes in the estimated liability and related insurance asset. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of managements judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of asbestos related assets and liabilities. Income Taxes In determining taxable income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future pre tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We currently have recorded valuation allowances that we will maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense recorded in the future may be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction. Any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance could result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management records the affect of a tax rate or law change on the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period of enactment. Future tax rate or law changes could have a material effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and 53 Table of Contents other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Asset Impairments Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually and more frequently if triggering events occur. In performing these assessments, management relies on various factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections including expectations and assumptions regarding the timing and degree of any economic recovery, anticipated future cash flows, comparable market transactions (to the extent available) and other market data. We elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for all goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. In the first step of the goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. Fair value for the goodwill impairment test is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on forecast cash flows (including estimated underlying revenue and operating income growth rates) discounted using an estimated weighted average cost of capital for market participants. A market approach, utilizing observable market data such as comparable companies in similar lines of business that are publicly traded or which are part of a public or private transaction (to the extent available), is used to corroborate the discounted cash flow analysis performed at each reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered potentially impaired and further tests are performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. In the second step of the goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill. We recorded no goodwill impairments in conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment assessment performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Additionally, we determined as part of the assessment that our Water and Environmental Systems reporting unit within our Flow Control segment had limited recoverability of goodwill. The fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 6.9%. As of September 30, 2011, the Water and Environmental Systems goodwill balance was $298 million. While historical performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values of goodwill in excess of carrying values, if our assumptions are not realized, it is possible that in the future an impairment charge may need to be recorded. However, it is not possible at this time to determine if an impairment charge would result or if such a charge would be material. The Company will continue to monitor the recoverability of its goodwill. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the 54 Table of Contents underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of the aforementioned reporting units may include such items as follows: A prolonged downturn in the business environment in which the reporting units operate (i.e. sales volumes and prices) especially in the commercial construction and retailer end markets; An economic recovery that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing or degree; Volatility in equity and debt markets resulting in higher discount rates; and Unexpected regulatory changes. While historical performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values of goodwill in excess of carrying values, if our assumptions are not realized, it is possible that in the future an impairment charge may need to be recorded. However, it is not possible at this time to determine if an impairment charge would result or if such a charge would be material. Long Lived Assets Asset groups held and used by the Company, including property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be fully recoverable. Tyco performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if impairment exists. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, Tyco groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identified. If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Impairments to long lived assets to be disposed of are recorded based upon the fair value less cost to sell of the applicable assets. The calculation of the fair value of long lived assets is based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of long lived assets, there is a risk that the carrying value of our long lived assets may be overstated or understated. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations. Two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions resulting in actuarial gains and losses. For active plans, such actuarial gains and losses will be amortized over the average expected service period of the participants and in the case of inactive plans over the average remaining life expectancy of participants. The discount rate represents the market rate for high quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of pension obligations by approximately $75 million and increase our annual pension expense by approximately $2 million. We consider the relative weighting of plan assets by class, historical performance of asset classes over long term periods, asset class performance expectations as well as current and future economic conditions in determining the expected long term return on plan assets. A 25 basis point decrease in the expected long term return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately $4 million. 55  Table of Contents  Liquidity and Capital Resources A fundamental objective of the Company is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of its core businesses around the world. The primary source of funds to finance our operations and capital expenditures is cash generated by operations. In addition, we maintain a commercial paper program, have access to committed revolving credit facilities and have access to equity and debt capital from public and private sources. We continue to balance our operating, investing and financing uses of cash through investments and acquisitions in our core businesses, dividends and share repurchases. In addition, we currently estimate that we will incur approximately $700 million in costs related to the 2012 Separation. We believe our cash position, amounts available under our credit facilities and cash provided by operating activities will be adequate to cover our operational and business needs in the foreseeable future. We had $1.4 billion and $1.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively. Cash generated by operating activities decreased to $2.4 billion for the year ended September 30, 2011 compared to $2.6 billion for the year ended September 24, 2010. Cash used in investing activities was $1.3 billion for the year ended September 30, 2011 compared to $1.8 billion for the year ended September 24, 2010. Cash used in financing activities was $1.5 billion for the year ended September 30, 2011 compared to $1.4 billion for the year ended September 24, 2010. As of September 30, 2011, our shareholders equity was $14.2 billion and our total debt was $4.1 billion. In addition, we had lines of credit totaling approximately $1.5 billion, none of which were drawn. Our ratio of total debt to total capital (the sum of our short and long term debt and shareholders equity) was 23% as of both September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively. This ratio is a measure of our long term liquidity and is an indicator of financial flexibility. On January 12, 2011, TIFSA, our finance subsidiary, issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% notes due on January 15, 2018 and $250 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% notes due on January 15, 2023, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. TIFSA received net cash proceeds of approximately $494 million. The net proceeds, along with other available funds, were used to fund the repayment of all of our outstanding 6.75% notes due in February 2011 with a principal amount of $516 million. On March 24, 2011, TIFSA, as the Borrower, and the Company as the Guarantor, entered into a Four Year Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement, providing for revolving credit commitments in the aggregate amount of $750 million (the "Credit Agreement"). In connection with entering into the Credit Agreement, TIFSA and the Company terminated the existing Three Year Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement, dated June 24, 2008, which provided for revolving credit commitments in the aggregate amount of $500 million, and which was scheduled to expire in June 2011. At the same time, TIFSA also reduced the lenders commitments under its existing Five Year Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement, dated April 25, 2007, from an aggregate of $1.19 billion to $750 million, and which is scheduled to expire in April 2012. 56 Table of Contents Cash flow from operating activities The sources of our cash flow from operating activities and the use of a portion of that cash in our operations for the years ended September 30, 2011, September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009 are as follows ($ in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Cash flows from operating activities: Operating income (loss) $ 2,119 $ 1,598 $ (1,506 ) Goodwill and intangible asset impairments 2,705 Depreciation and amortization(1) 1,318 1,203 1,126 (Gain) loss on divestitures (230 ) (41 ) 13 Non cash compensation expense 110 120 103 Deferred income taxes 91 (129 ) (90 ) Provision for losses on accounts receivable and inventory 82 127 156 Other, net 67 37 80 Net change in working capital (584 ) 106 128 Interest income 34 31 44 Interest expense (244 ) (284 ) (301 ) Income tax expense (326 ) (138 ) (71 ) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,437 $ 2,630 $ 2,387 Other cash flow items: Capital expenditures, net(2) $ (779 ) $ (689 ) $ (690 ) Increase (decrease) in the sale of accounts receivable 1 (2 ) 10 Accounts purchased by ADT (614 ) (559 ) (543 ) Purchase accounting and holdback liabilities (10 ) (3 ) (2 ) Voluntary pension contributions 15 22 (1)Includes depreciation expense of $695 million, $654 million, and $610 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and amortization of intangible assets of $623 million, $549 million, and $516 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The significant changes in working capital included a $271 million decrease in accrued and other liabilities, a $187 million increase in accounts receivable and a $137 million increase in inventories. The net change in working capital increased operating cash flow by $106 million in 2010. The significant changes in working capital included a $119 million increase in accounts payable and an $88 million decrease in prepaid and other current assets which were partially offset by a $108 million increase in inventories. The net change in working capital increased operating cash flow by $128 million in 2009. The significant changes in working capital included a $346 million decrease in inventory, a $191 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $106 million net decrease in contracts in progress, partially offset by a $337 million decrease in accounts payable and a $138 million decrease in income taxes, net. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, we paid approximately $114 million, $160 million (inclusive of $2 million relating to the French security business being classified as held for sale) and $152 million, respectively, in cash related to restructuring activities. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our restructuring activities. During the years ended September 30, 2011, September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009 we made required contributions of $78 million, $82 million and $60 million, respectively to our U.S. and 57 Table of Contents non U.S. pension plans. We also made voluntary contributions of approximately $15 million, nil and $22 million to our U.S. plans during the years ended September 30, 2011, September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009. We anticipate contributing at least the minimum required to our pension plans in fiscal year 2012 of $44 million for our U.S. plans and $60 million for our non U.S. plans. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, related to continuing operations were $196 million, $255 million, and $281 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net interest paid, related to continuing operations were $195 million, $234 million, and $249 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Cash flow from investing activities We made capital expenditures of $788 million, $718 million, and $702 million during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The level of capital expenditures in fiscal year 2012 is expected to exceed the spending levels in fiscal year 2011 and is also expected to exceed depreciation expense. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, we paid approximately $614 million, $559 million, and $543 million of cash, respectively, to acquire approximately 565,000, 501,000 and 512,000 customer contracts for electronic security services within our Tyco Security Solutions segment. During 2011, we paid cash for acquisitions included in continuing operations totaling $656 million, net of cash acquired of $4 million, which primarily related to the acquisitions of Signature Security Group within our Tyco Security Solutions segment, KEF Holdings Ltd. within our Tyco Flow Control segment and Chemguard within our Tyco Fire Protection segment. During 2010, cash paid for acquisitions included in continuing operations totaled $600 million, net of cash acquired of $137 million, which primarily related to the acquisition of Broadview Security within our Tyco Security Solutions segment and Hiter within our Tyco Flow Control segment. During 2011, we received cash proceeds, net of cash divested of approximately $1 billion for divestitures. The cash proceeds primarily related to the sale of a majority interest in our Electrical and Metal Products business of $713 million, which is presented in continuing operations and $264 million for the sale of our European water business which is presented in discontinued operations. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Cash flow from financing activities On January 12, 2011, TIFSA, our finance subsidiary, issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% notes due on January 15, 2018 and $250 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% notes due on January 15, 2023, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. TIFSA received net cash proceeds of approximately $494 million after deducting debt issuance costs and a debt discount. The net proceeds, along with other available funds, were used to fund the repayment of all of our outstanding 6.75% notes due in February 2011 with a principal amount of $516 million. In connection with the acquisition of KEF during the year ended September 30, 2011, the Company acquired $64 million of debt which was substantially paid as of September 30, 2011. During the second half of fiscal 2011, TIFSA issued commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2011, TIFSA had no commercial paper outstanding. During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, TIFSA had made payments of $200 million to extinguish all of its commercial paper outstanding. On May 5, 2010, TIFSA issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375% notes due, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. TIFSA received net proceeds of 58 Table of Contents approximately $495 million after deducting debt issuance costs and a debt discount. On May 28, 2010, the Company used the net proceeds of the aforementioned offering and additional cash on hand to redeem all of its 6.375% public notes due 2011, 7% notes due 2028 and 6.875% notes due 2029, outstanding at that time, which aggregated $878 million in principal amount.

Additionally, in November 2008, TIFSA made a payment of $300 million to extinguish all of its 6.125% notes due 2008. Pursuant to our share repurchase program, we may repurchase Tyco shares from time to time in open market purchases at prevailing market prices, in negotiated transactions off the market, or pursuant to an approved 10b5 1 trading plan in accordance with applicable regulations. During the year ended September 30, 2011, we repurchased approximately 30 million common shares for approximately $1.3 billion under the 2011, 2010 and 2008 share repurchase programs, which completed both the 2010 and 2008 programs. During the year ended September 24, 2010, we repurchased approximately 24 million common shares for approximately $900 million under the 2008 share repurchase program. On March 9, 2011, our shareholders approved an annual dividend on our common shares of $1.00 per share, to be paid from contributed surplus in four installments of $0.25 per share. During the 2011, 2010 and 2009 fiscal years, we paid cash dividends of approximately $458 million, $416 million and $388 million, respectively. See Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Management believes that cash generated by or available to us should be sufficient to fund our capital and operational business needs for the foreseeable future, including capital expenditures, quarterly dividend payments, share repurchases and separation related expenses. Commitments and Contingencies For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to tax and litigation matters and governmental investigations, see Notes 7 and 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations and commitments for debt, minimum lease payment obligations under non cancellable operating leases and obligations as of September 30, 2011 are as follows ($ in millions): Fiscal Year 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total Debt principal(1) $ $ $ 656 $ 500 $ 500 $ 2,379 $ 4,035 Interest payments(2) 240 240 220 190 171 571 1,632 Capital leases(3) 3 4 5 6 8 30 56 Operating leases 228 179 133 105 62 143 850 Purchase obligations(4) 492 32 5 1 530 Total contractual cash obligations(5) $ 963 $ 455 $ 1,019 $ 802 $ 741 $ 3,123 $ 7,103 (1)Excludes debt discount, swap activity and interest. 59 Table of Contents (2)Interest payments consist of interest on our fixed interest rate debt and exclude the impact of our interest rate swaps. As of September 30, 2011, we had swapped an aggregate of approximately $1.2 billion of fixed for floating rate debt. (3)Excludes interest. (4)Purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of goods and services. (5)Other long term liabilities excluded from the above contractual obligation table primarily consist of the following: pension and postretirement costs, income taxes, warranties and environmental liabilities. We are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items due to the inherent uncertainties related to these obligations. However, the minimum required contributions to our pension plans are expected to be approximately $104 million in 2012 and we expect to pay $5 million in 2012 related to postretirement benefit plans. As of September 30, 2011, we recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $270 million and gross interest and penalties of $60 million. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing for the remaining payments in future years; therefore, such amounts have been excluded from the above contractual obligation table. However, based on the current status of our income tax audits, we believe that is reasonably possible that between nil and $60 million in unrecognized tax benefits may be resolved in the next twelve months. As of September 30, 2011, we had total commitments of $1.5 billion under our revolving credit facilities, $750 million of which expires on March 24, 2015 and $750 million of which expires on April 25, 2012. As of September 30, 2011, there were no amounts drawn under these revolving credit facilities. TIFSAs bank credit agreements contain customary terms and conditions, and financial covenants that limit the ratio of our debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and that limit our ability to incur subsidiary debt or grant liens on our property. Our indentures contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges, subsidiary debt and sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are considered restrictive to our business. During the second half of fiscal 2011, TIFSA, the Companys finance subsidiary, issued commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, TIFSA had no commercial paper outstanding. In the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In connection with the 2007 Separation, we entered into a liability sharing agreement regarding certain actions that were pending against Tyco prior to the 2007 Separation. Under the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, we have assumed 27%, Covidien has assumed 42% and TE Connectivity has assumed 31% of certain Tyco pre Separation contingent and other corporate liabilities, which, as of September 30, 2011, primarily relate to tax contingencies and potential actions with respect to the spin offs or the distributions made or brought by any third party. Backlog We had a backlog of unfilled orders of $9.7 billion and $9.5 billion as of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively. We expect that approximately 88% of our backlog as of 60 Table of Contents September 30, 2011 will be filled during the next 12 months. Backlog by segment was as follows ($ in millions): September 30, 2011 September 24, 2010 Tyco Security Solutions $ 6,776 $ 6,610 Tyco Flow Control 1,744 1,482 Tyco Fire Protection 1,131 1,296 Electrical and Metal Products 88 $ 9,651 $ 9,476 Backlog increased $175 million, or 1.8%, to $9.7 billion as of September 30, 2011. The net increase in backlog was primarily related to an increase in recurring revenue in force in our Tyco Security Solutions segment and increased bookings in our Tyco Flow Control segment. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in bookings in our Tyco Fire Protection segment. Tyco Security Solutions backlog includes recurring revenue in force and long term deferred revenue for upfront fees paid by customers for Tyco Security Solutions owned security systems. Revenue in force represents 12 months revenue associated with monitoring and maintenance services under contract in the security business. Tyco Security Solutions backlog of $6.8 billion and $6.6 billion as of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively, consists primarily of $4.9 billion and $4.8 billion of recurring revenue in force as of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively, and $1.1 billion of deferred revenue for both September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010. Tyco Security Solutions backlog increased $166 million, or 2.5%. The net increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue in force, partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates by $36 million, or 0.5%. Tyco Flow Controls backlog increased by $262 million, or 17.7%. The net increase was primarily due to increased bookings for several large projects within our Valves and Controls and Thermal Controls businesses. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted Tyco Flow Controls backlog by $7 million, or 0.5%. These increases were partially offset by a decline in bookings in our Water and Environmental Systems business. Tyco Fire Protections backlog decreased by $165 million, or 12.7%. Tyco Fire Protections backlog was unfavorably impacted by the deconsolidation of a joint venture as a result of adopting a new accounting standard. In addition, backlog decreased in EMEA as a result of project selectivity resulting from a focus on higher margin projects. These decreases were partially offset by increases in our North American and global Fire Safety Products businesses. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates also favorably impacted Tyco Fire Protections backlog by $17 million, or 1.3%.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale of Accounts Receivable Certain of our international businesses utilize the sale of accounts receivable as short term financing mechanisms. The aggregate amount outstanding under our international accounts receivable programs was not material as of September 30, 2011 or September 24, 2010. Guarantees Certain of our business segments have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from the current fiscal year through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would typically be triggered in the event of nonperformance and performance under the guarantees, if required, would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 61 Table of Contents There are certain guarantees or indemnifications extended among Tyco, Covidien and TE Connectivity in accordance with the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Tax Sharing Agreement. The guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the Tax Sharing Agreement. At the time of the 2007 Separation, we recorded a liability necessary to recognize the fair value of such guarantees and indemnifications. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Tax Sharing Agreement. In addition, prior to the 2007 Separation we provided support in the form of financial and or performance guarantees to various Covidien and TE Connectivity operating entities. To the extent these guarantees were not assigned in connection with the 2007 Separation, we assumed primary liability on any remaining such support. These obligations were not material to us as of September 30, 2011. In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these liabilities. In the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. We record estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As of September 30, 2011, we had total outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees of approximately $724 million. For a detailed discussion of guarantees and indemnifications, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Factors that might affect such forward looking statements include, among other things: overall economic and business conditions, and overall demand for Tycos goods and services; 62 Table of Contents economic and competitive conditions in the industries, end markets and regions served by our businesses; changes in tax requirements (including tax rate changes, new tax laws or treaties and revised tax law interpretations); results and consequences of Tycos internal investigations and governmental investigations concerning the Companys governance, management, internal controls and operations including its business operations outside the United States; the outcome of litigation, arbitrations and governmental proceedings; effect of income tax audit settlement and appeals; our ability to repay or refinance our outstanding indebtedness as it matures; our ability to operate within the limitations imposed by financing arrangements and to maintain our credit ratings; interest rate fluctuations and other changes in borrowing costs; other capital market conditions, including availability of funding sources and currency exchange rate fluctuations; availability of and fluctuations in the prices of key raw materials; economic and political conditions in international markets, including governmental changes and restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders; the ability to achieve cost savings in connection with the Companys strategic restructuring and "growing lean" initiatives; our ability to execute our portfolio refinement and acquisition strategies; potential impairment of our goodwill, intangibles and or our long lived assets; the impact of fluctuations in the price of Tyco common shares, including potentially adverse impacts resulting from the proposed spin offs of our flow control and North American residential security businesses; risks associated with our Swiss incorporation, including the possibility of reduced flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management, increased or different regulatory burdens, and the possibility that we may not realize anticipated tax benefits; changes in U.S. and non U.S. government laws and regulations; the possible effects on Tyco of future legislation in the United States that may limit or eliminate potential U.S. tax benefits resulting from Tyco Internationals Swiss incorporation or deny U.S. government contracts to Tyco based upon its Swiss incorporation; failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to satisfy any other condition to the proposed spin offs; failure to realize the expected benefits of the proposed spin offs, including the tax free nature of the spin offs; and failure to complete the proposed spin offs on schedule and within estimated costs. 63 Table of Contents  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of conducting business, we are exposed to certain risks associated with potential changes in market conditions. These risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Accordingly, we have established a comprehensive risk management process to monitor, evaluate and manage the principal exposures to which we believe we are subject. We seek to manage these risks through the use of financial derivative instruments. Our portfolio of derivative financial instruments may, from time to time, include forward foreign currency exchange contracts, foreign currency options, interest rate swaps, commodity swaps and forward commodity contracts. Derivative financial instruments related to interest rate sensitivity of debt obligations, intercompany cross border transactions and anticipated non functional currency cash flows are used with the goal of mitigating a significant portion of these exposures when it is cost effective to do so. We do not execute transactions or utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, to reduce the risk that a counterparty will be unable to honor its contractual obligations to us, we only enter into contracts with counterparties having at least an A /A3 long term debt rating. These counterparties are generally financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one party. Foreign Currency Exposures We hedge our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates through the use of forward foreign currency exchange contracts. During 2011, our largest exposures to foreign exchange rates existed primarily with the Swiss franc, British pound, Euro, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. The market risk related to the forward foreign currency exchange contracts is measured by estimating the potential impact of a 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates. The rates used to perform this analysis were based on the market rates in effect on September 30, 2011. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in a $32 million net decrease in the fair value of the contracts. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in a $39 million net increase in the fair value of the contracts. However, gains or losses on these derivative instruments are economically offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. During the third quarter of 2010, Tyco International Finance, S.A. ("TIFSA"), the Companys finance subsidiary, entered into foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge its Euro denominated net investment. The aggregate notional amount of these hedges was approximately $224 million and $255 million as of September 30, 2011, and September 24, 2010, respectively. The potential impact from a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro would result in a $19 million net increase in other comprehensive income. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro would result in a $24 million net decrease in other comprehensive income. As of September 30, 2011, and September 24, 2010, $2.9 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, of intercompany loans have been designated as permanent in nature. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011, September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, we recorded $16 million of cumulative transaction gain, $24 million of cumulative translation loss and nil, respectively, through accumulated other comprehensive loss related to these loans. 64  Table of Contents Interest Rate Exposures Our long term debt portfolio primarily consists of fixed rate instruments. The Company manages its interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swap transactions with financial institutions acting as principal counterparties, which were designated as fair value hedges for accounting purposes. These interest rate swap transactions manage the exposure to interest rate risk by converting interest rates of fixed rate debt to variable rates. During the second quarter of 2011, TIFSA also entered into interest rate swaps contracts to hedge $155 million notional amount of the 4.125% public notes due 2014. In these contracts, TIFSA agrees with financial institutions acting as principal counterparties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated on an agreed upon notional principal amount. In connection with the maturity of the 6.75% public notes during the second quarter of 2011, TIFSA settled the corresponding interest rate swaps. As of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, the total gross notional amount of the Companys interest rate swap contracts was $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates as of September 30, 2011 would result in a $29 million net decrease in the fair value of the contracts. Conversely, a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates as of September 30, 2011 would result in a $30 million net increase in the fair value of the contracts. Commodity Exposures We are exposed to volatility in the prices of raw materials used in some of our products and may, in limited circumstances, enter into hedging contracts to manage those exposures. These exposures are monitored as an integral part of our risk management program. During 2011 and 2010, the Company entered into commodity swaps for copper which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. These swaps did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the price of copper as of September 30, 2011 would not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 65 Table of Contents  
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the Companys financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the Selected Financial Data and our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The Companys actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those under the headings "Risk Factors" and "Forward Looking Information." Introduction The Consolidated Financial Statements include the consolidated results of Tyco International Ltd., a company organized under the laws of Switzerland, and its subsidiaries (hereinafter collectively referred to as "we", the "Company" or "Tyco"). The financial statements have been prepared in United States dollars ("USD"), in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). During the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we realigned our Safety Products segment between our ADT Worldwide and Fire Protection segments to create two new segments: Tyco Security Solutions and Tyco Fire Protection. Tyco Security Solutions consists of the former ADT Worldwide segment as well as the portion of the former Safety Products segment that manufactures security products including intrusion, security, access control and video management systems. Tyco Fire Protection consists of the former Fire Protection Services segment as well as a number of businesses from the former Safety Products segment including the fire suppression, fire detection and life safety products businesses. In addition, various businesses were realigned between Tyco Security Solutions and Tyco Fire Protection. As a result of this realignment, as well as the sale of a majority interest in our Electrical and Metal Products business further described below, we began operating in the following business segments: Tyco Security Solutions designs, sells, installs, services and monitors electronic security, productivity and lifestyle enhancement systems for residential, commercial, industrial and governmental customers. In addition, Tyco Security Solutions designs, manufactures and sells security products including intrusion, security, access control, electronic article surveillance and video management systems. Tyco Fire Protection designs, manufactures, sells, installs and services fire detection and fire suppression systems and building and life safety products for commercial, industrial and governmental customers. Tyco Flow Control designs, manufactures, sells and services valves, pipes, fittings, valve automation and heat tracing products for general process, energy and mining markets as well as the water and wastewater markets. We also provide general corporate services to our segments and these costs are reported as Corporate and Other. Overview Net revenue for the year ended September 30, 2011 increased by $339 million, or 2.0%, to $17.4 billion as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010. Net revenue increased in fiscal 2011 despite the sale of our majority interest in the Electrical and Metal Products business, which contributed $1.4 billion of revenue during the year ended September 24, 2010 and $347 million during the year 36 Table of Contents ended September 30, 2011. Net revenue increased across all of our segments mainly attributable to strength in our Tyco Security Solutions and Tyco Fire Protection segments and to a lesser extent our Tyco Flow Control segment. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates also impacted net revenue by $503 million, or 3.0%. In addition, because the Companys fiscal year ends on the last Friday in September, fiscal 2011 consisted of 53 weeks, as compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2010 and 2009. As a result, fiscal year 2011 includes an estimated $143 million, or 0.8%, of revenue from the additional week. Service revenue, which is primarily recurring in nature, represented approximately 45% of our overall revenue for the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to 41% and 40% for 2010 and 2009, respectively. Service revenue as a percentage of net revenue increased due to the divestiture of our Electrical and Metal Products business, which did not have a significant service component as well as due to strength in our Tyco Security Solutions and Tyco Fire Protection businesses. Service revenues are principally derived from our Tyco Security Solutions and Tyco Fire Protection businesses, and represent a consistent source of revenue from monitoring and maintenance services under contractual agreements. Recurring revenue in our Tyco Security Solutions business grew to approximately 57% of Tyco Security Solutions total revenue for the year ended September 30, 2011 which is primarily due to the integration of Broadview Security, compared to approximately 56% for the year ended September 24, 2010, and 52% for the year ended September 25, 2009. In the Tyco Fire Protection business, service revenue remained steady as a percentage of Tyco Fire Protections total revenue at 38% in 2011 and 2010, as compared to 36% in 2009. For the year ended September 30, 2011, non service revenue in Tyco Security Solutions and Tyco Fire Protection improved slightly compared to the prior annual periods, due to strength in systems installation and related products and product sales in Tyco Security Solutions and product sales in Tyco Fire Protection. These improvements were partially offset by continued weakness in our Tyco Flow Control segments Water and Environmental Systems business. Operating income for the year ended September 30, 2011 increased $521 million, or 33%, to $2.1 billion, as compared to operating income of $1.6 billion for the year ended September 24, 2010. Operating income for the year ended September 30, 2011 includes a net gain on divestitures of $230 million primarily related to the sale of a majority interest in our Electrical and Metal products business compared to a net gain on divestitures of $40 million for the year ended September 24, 2010. Operating income was also favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $60 million, or 3.8%. The increase in operating income in 2011 also reflects strong growth in our Tyco Security Solutions business. Operating income was favorably impacted for the year ended September 30, 2011 due to lower restructuring and asset impairment charges of $87 million as compared to $145 million for the year ended September 24, 2010. Operating income for the year ended September 30, 2011 included acquisition and integration costs of $39 million as compared to $35 million for the year ended September 24, 2010. Our cash balance was $1.4 billion and $1.8 billion as of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively. We generated approximately $2.4 billion of cash from operating activities and utilized $1.3 billion of cash in investing activities and $1.5 billion of cash in financing activities during the year ended September 30, 2011. During the year ended September 30, 2011, approximately $1.0 billion of cash was generated from divestitures, primarily related to $713 million for the sale of the majority interest in our Electrical and Metal Products business and $264 million for the sale of our European water business, which was presented in net cash provided by (used in) discontinued investing activities in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. During the year ended September 30, 2011, uses of cash primarily included $1.3 billion to repurchase our common shares, $788 million of capital expenditures, $656 million for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, $614 million to purchase customer contracts in our Tyco Security Solutions segment and $458 million to pay cash dividends. 37 Table of Contents Recent Transactions On September 19, 2011, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a plan to separate the Company into three separate, publicly traded companies consisting of the Companys North American residential security business, its flow control business, and its commercial fire and security business. The 2012 Separation is expected to be completed by the end of the third calendar quarter of 2012 through a tax free pro rata distribution of all of the equity interest in the flow control and North American residential security business. Completion of the proposed separation is subject to certain conditions, including final approval by the Tyco Board of Directors and shareholders, receipt of tax opinions and rulings and the filing and effectiveness of registration statements with the SEC. The separation will also be subject to the completion of any necessary financing. During fiscal 2011, we made a number of strategic investments within our three core businesses. On April 29, 2011, our Tyco Security Solutions segment completed the acquisition of Signature Security Group for $184 million, net of cash acquired of $2 million. Signature Security Group is an electronic security company operating in Australia and New Zealand primarily in small business and residential markets. On June 29, 2011, the Companys Flow Control segment finalized the acquisition of a 75% equity interest in privately held KEF Holdings Ltd. ("KEF"), a vertically integrated valve manufacturer in the Middle East, for approximately $295 million, net of cash acquired of $1 million. Additionally, in connection with the acquisition we acquired $64 million of debt which was substantially paid as of September 30, 2011. On September 1, 2011, our Fire Protection segment completed the acquisition of Chemguard Inc. ("Chemguard") for approximately $130 million, net of cash acquired of $1 million. Chemguard is a provider of firefighting foam concentrates and equipment, foam systems, services and specialty chemicals. On September 15, 2011, the Company reached an agreement to acquire Visonic Ltd. ("Visonic"), a global developer and manufacturer of electronic security systems and components, for approximately $100 million in cash. The transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Following the close of the transaction, the Company intends to combine Visonic with the Companys Tyco Security Solutions segment. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements On November 9, 2010, we announced that we entered into an investment agreement (the "Agreement") to sell a majority interest in our Electrical and Metal Products business to an affiliate of the private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC (the "Investor"). We formed a newly incorporated holding company, Atkore International Group Inc. ("Atkore"), to hold our Electrical and Metal Products business. On December 22, 2010, the transaction closed and the Investor acquired shares of a newly created class of cumulative convertible preferred stock of Atkore (the "Preferred Stock"). The Preferred Stock initially represented 51% of the outstanding capital stock (on an as converted basis) of Atkore. In connection with the closing, we received cash proceeds of approximately $713 million and recorded a gain of $259 million during the first quarter of 2011. During the year ended September 30, 2011, we recorded working capital adjustments of $11 million that reduced the gain on disposal. The gain on disposal is recorded within restructuring, asset impairments and divestiture (gains) charges, net in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. On September 30, 2010, we sold our water business in Europe, which was part of our Tyco Flow Control segment. The business met the discontinued operations criteria and has been included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. The sale was completed for approximately $264 million in cash proceeds, net of $7 million of cash divested on sale, and a pre tax gain of $172 million, which was largely exempt from tax. The gain was recorded in income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations. References to the segment data are to the Companys continuing operations. As discussed above, the Company realigned certain business operations during the first quarter of fiscal 2011 and 38 Table of Contents accordingly has recast prior period segment amounts.

Operating income was $100 million for the year ended September 24, 2010 and operating loss was $938 million for the year ended September 25, 2009. There is no annual discussion relating to the Electrical and Metal Products business. This information has been provided in order to reconcile to the above net revenue and operating income for the years ended September 30, 2011, September 24, 2010, and September 25, 2009. Segment Results The segment discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in results for each of our segments included in continuing operations. 39 Table of Contents Tyco Security Solutions Net Revenue Net revenue for Tyco Security Solutions for the years ended September 30, 2011, September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009 were as follows ($ in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Service revenue Recurring $ 4,907 $ 4,295 $ 3,861 Non recurring 729 709 951 Total service revenue 5,636 5,004 4,812 (1) Revenue from product sales (non recurring) System installation and related products 2,584 2,377 2,255 Security products 406 353 308 Total revenue from product sales 2,990 2,730 2,563 (1) Net revenue $ 8,626 $ 7,734 $ 7,375 (1)As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, revenue related to the sale of electronic tags and labels utilized in retailer anti theft systems is classified as revenue from product sales. In reporting periods prior to the first quarter of fiscal 2010, revenue related to the sale of electronic tags and labels utilized in retailer anti theft systems was misclassified as service revenue. Such item had no effect on net revenue, operating income (loss), net income (loss) and cash flows. No changes have been made to previously filed financial statements or in the comparative amounts presented herein, as the effect in prior periods is not material. Revenue related to the sale of such electronic tags and labels reflected as service revenue was $286 million in 2009 and related cost of services was $176 million in 2009. Net revenue for Tyco Security Solutions of $8.6 billion increased by $892 million, or 11.5%, during the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010. Net revenue was favorably impacted by the estimated net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of $235 million, or 3.0%, substantially all of which was related to the acquisition of Broadview Security in May 2010, and to a lesser extent, Signature Security Group in April 2011, offset by divested revenue from our French Security business which was sold in March 2010. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates also favorably impacted net revenue by $192 million, or 2.5%. In addition, an estimated $38 million, or 0.5%, of revenue is attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2011, all of which is non recurring. The remaining increase in net revenue was primarily due to incremental account growth, net of attrition, in the recurring revenue businesses in North America and Rest of World ("ROW"), and strength in our non recurring businesses related to construction project activity and security system upgrades in North America and retail store expansion activity in ROW. Net revenue for Tyco Security Solutions of $7.7 billion increased by $359 million, or 4.9%, during the year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to September 25, 2009. Net revenue was favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $239 million, or 3.2%. Net revenue was also favorably impacted by the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of $72 million, or 1.0%, which was primarily the result of $193 million in net revenue estimated to be contributed by the Broadview Security acquisition partially offset by $109 million of divested revenue relating to our French security business. 40 Table of Contents Recurring Net Revenue Recurring revenue is generated from contractual monitoring and maintenance agreements that are long term in nature, and is primarily driven by the addition or loss of customer accounts and increases or decreases in average revenue per customer. For the Years Ended September 30, 2011 September 24, 2010 September 25, 2009 Number of customer accounts(1) 9.0 million 8.9 million 7.4 million Trailing 52 week attrition(1)(2) 12.6% 12.8% 13.3% Average monthly revenue per customer(1) $45.35 $44.62 $45.81 (1)The number of customer accounts, attrition rates and average revenue per customer for all periods exclude the impact of divestitures. (2)Trailing 52 week attrition rates exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Recurring revenue increased by $612 million, or 14.2%, to approximately $4.9 billion during the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010. Recurring net revenue was favorably impacted by the estimated impact of acquisitions and divestitures of $322 million, or 7.5%, relating to our acquisition of Broadview Security in May 2010, and to a lesser extent the acquisition of Signature Security Group in April 2011. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates also favorably impacted recurring revenue by $84 million, or 2.0%. Customer accounts grew during the year ended September 30, 2011 by approximately 0.1 million, or 1.1%, to a total of 9.0 million accounts. The increase in average monthly revenue per customer of $0.73 from the year ended September 24, 2010 to the year ended September 30, 2011 was partially due to favorable foreign exchange rates along with incremental account growth, net of attrition, in the North America and ROW regions. Recurring revenue increased by $434 million, or 11.2%, to approximately $4.3 billion, during the year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to the year ended September 25, 2009, as a result of growth in customer accounts of approximately 1.5 million, or 20.3%, to a total of approximately 8.9 million accounts as of September 24, 2010. Approximately 1.4 million customer accounts were acquired on May 14, 2010 in connection with the Broadview Security acquisition. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted recurring revenue by $149 million, or 3.9%, and $116 million, or 3.0%, respectively, in 2010. Non Recurring Net Revenue Non recurring revenue is generated from product sales (including sales and installation of electronic security and products related to retailer anti theft systems, as well as other life safety systems) and from services such as the provisioning of armored guards and one time repair, security system upgrades or inspection jobs. Non recurring net revenue increased by $280 million, or 8.1%, to $3.7 billion for the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted non recurring net revenue by $108 million, or 3.1%. In addition, an estimated $38 million, or 1.1%, of non recurring revenue is attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2011. These increases were partially offset by an unfavorable net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of $89 million or 2.6%, primarily relating to the sale of our French Security business in March 2010. The remaining increase was primarily due to strength in commercial end markets with new retail store expansion activity in ROW and increased demand within North America for construction projects and security systems upgrades. 41 Table of Contents Non recurring revenue declined by $75 million, or 2.1%, to approximately $3.4 billion during the year ended September 24, 2010, as compared to the year ended September 25, 2009, due to lower sales volume primarily as the result of weakness in the commercial end market, which declined at a slower rate than the same period in the prior year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted systems installation, product sales and other service revenue by $122 million, or 3.5%, while the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures resulted in an unfavorable impact of $76 million, or 2.2%. Revenue by Geography North American revenue consists of residential and small business, primarily a recurring revenue business, and commercial, primarily a non recurring revenue business. Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") and ROW revenue are primarily commercial. Net revenue by geography for Tyco Security Solutions was as follows ($in millions): 2011 2010 2009 North America $ 5,102 $ 4,436 $ 4,185 Europe, Middle East and Africa 1,726 1,738 1,875 Rest of World 1,392 1,207 1,007 Tyco Security Products(1) 406 353 308 Net revenue $ 8,626 $ 7,734 $ 7,375 (1)Tyco Security Products is managed as a global business. North America Net revenue in North America increased by $666 million, or 15.0%, for the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Broadview Security. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted North American revenue by $25 million, or 0.6%. Residential and small business net revenue increased by 19.9% compared to the year ended September 24, 2010, primarily due to the acquisition of Broadview Security. Commercial net revenue increased by 8.2%, as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010, primarily as a result of an increase in construction projects and security system upgrades in the commercial end markets which was partially offset by softness in the retail market. Net revenue in North America increased by $251 million, or 6.0%, for the year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to the year ended September 25, 2009, primarily as the result of the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, which favorably impacted net revenue by an estimated $193 million, or 4.6%, as the result of the acquisition of Broadview Security. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates also favorably impacted net revenue by $48 million, or 1.1%. Residential and small business net revenue increased by 15.3% compared to the year ended September 25, 2010, primarily due to the acquisition of Broadview Security. Commercial net revenue decreased by 4.8% due to the decline in systems installation and product sales as the result of weakness in the commercial market, although the rate of decline was slower than the same period in the prior year. Europe, Middle East, and Africa Net revenue in EMEA decreased by $12 million, or 0.7%, for the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010, primarily due to the unfavorable net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of $138 million, or 7.9%, resulting from the sale of certain businesses, including the French security business in March 2010, and several smaller businesses in Europe over the course of fiscal 2010. The decrease was partially offset by favorable changes in foreign currency 42 Table of Contents exchange rates of $70 million, or 4.0%. Stronger systems installation across Continental Europe also favorably increased net revenue. Net revenue in EMEA decreased by $137 million, or 7.3%, for the year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to the year ended September 25, 2009, as favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $60 million, or 3.2%, were more than offset by a decline in systems installation and other service revenue as a result of weakness in the commercial end market, although the rate of decline was slower than the same period in the prior year. Additionally, EMEA net revenue was unfavorably impacted by $120 million, or 6.4%, due to the impact of divestitures. Rest of World Net revenue in ROW increased by $185 million, or 15.3%, for the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net revenue by $83 million, or 6.9%. The remaining increase in net revenue in ROW was primarily attributable to retail store expansion, increases in the customer account bases and increased systems installation activity in the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions. Net revenue in ROW increased by $200 million, or 19.9%, for the year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to the year ended September 25, 2009, primarily due to recurring revenue growth in both Latin American and Asia Pacific regions resulting from customer account growth. The Asia Pacific region experienced an increase in system installation, products sales and other service revenue which was partially offset by a decrease in the Latin American region due to a slowdown in commercial and retailer end markets. Net revenue in the Rest of World geographies was also favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $111 million, or 11.0%. Tyco Security Products Net revenue in Tyco Security Products increased by $53 million, or 15.0%, for the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net revenue by $14 million, or 4.0%. The remaining increase in net revenue was primarily due to growth across multiple product lines globally. Net revenue in Tyco Security Products increased by $45 million, or 14.6%, for the year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to the year ended September 25, 2009. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net revenue by $20 million, or 6.5%. Additionally, net revenue increased due to higher volume primarily related to the introduction of several new products. Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income and operating margin for Tyco Security Solutions were as follows ($ in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Operating income $ 1,361 $ 1,090 $ (514 ) Operating margin 15.8 % 14.1 % %(1) (1)Certain operating margins and percentages have not been presented as management believes such calculations are not meaningful. 43  Table of Contents Operating income of $1.4 billion increased by $271 million, or 24.9%, in the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010. Operating income and operating margin for the year ended September 30, 2011 continued to be favorably impacted by higher sales volume, efficiencies gained through restructuring actions taken in prior years and other cost containment activities. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted operating income by $23 million, or 2.1%. Included in operating income for the year ended September 30, 2011 was $25 million of restructuring charges, net as compared to $62 million of restructuring charges, net for the year ended September 24, 2010. In addition, included in operating income for the year ended September 30, 2011 is $33 million of acquisition and integration costs primarily related to the acquisition of Broadview Security and Signature Security Group, as compared to $32 million of acquisition and integration costs during the year ended September 24, 2010. Included in the operating income for the prior year comparable period is a $45 million gain on divestitures, net primarily related to the sale of our French security business and a curtailment gain of $12 million, which was recognized upon the freezing of certain defined benefit plans in the United Kingdom, as compared to the absence of similar charges for the year ended September 30, 2011. Operating income of $1.1 billion increased by $1.6 billion in the year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to the year ended September 25, 2009. Operating income for the year ended September 25, 2009 was negatively affected by goodwill impairment charges of $1.3 billion recorded at our ADT EMEA, Access Controls and Video Systems ("ACVS") and Sensormatic Retail Solutions reporting units and intangible asset impairment charges of $64 million. Operating income for the year ended September 24, 2010 was positively impacted by the shift to higher margin recurring revenue. Additionally, 2010 operating income was favorably impacted by the net impact of savings realized through previous restructuring and cost containment actions, and a curtailment gain of $12 million recognized when certain defined benefit pension plans were frozen in the United Kingdom. These increases were partially offset by an increase in the amortization of intangible assets primarily relating to the Broadview Security acquisition. During the year ended September 24, 2010, $62 million of net restructuring charges were incurred, of which $14 million related to restructuring actions associated with the acquisition of Broadview Security, as compared to $118 million of restructuring charges, net during the year ended September 25, 2009. Additionally, management estimated that $2 million of additional charges resulting from restructuring actions was incurred during the year ended September 25, 2009. Fiscal 2010 also included a $45 million gain on divestitures, net primarily related to the sale of our French security business, and $32 million of acquisition and integration costs related to the acquisition of Broadview Security, as compared to a $6 million loss on divestitures and nil of acquisition costs during fiscal 2009. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted operating income by $33 million, or 6.4%. 44 Table of Contents Tyco Fire Protection Net Revenue Net revenue for Tyco Fire Protection for the years ended September 30, 2011, September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009 were as follows ($ in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Revenue from product sales Systems installation and related products $ 1,617 $ 1,621 (1) $ 1,744 (1) Products 1,320 1,156 1,206 Total revenue from products sales $ 2,937 $ 2,777 $ 2,950 Service revenue 1,806 1,733 (1) 1,670 (1) Net revenue $ 4,743 $ 4,510 $ 4,620 (1)Revenue related to the sale of certain products is classified as revenue from product sales. In reporting periods prior to the first quarter of fiscal 2011, revenue related to certain systems installation products was misclassified as service revenue. The service revenue and systems installation revenue during the years ended September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009 have not been changed for this misclassification, as the effect is not material. The impact of the misclassification for the years ended September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009 would have been to decrease service revenue by $37 million and $36 million, respectively, with a corresponding increase to systems installation within revenue from product sales. If the revenue from the sale of these products during the years ended September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009 were classified as product sales, service revenue would have increased $110 million, or 6.5% for the year ended September 30, 2011, and $62 million, or 3.8% for the year ended September 24, 2010. In addition, product sales would have increased by $123 million, or 4.4% for the year ended September 30, 2011, and decreased $172 million, or 5.8% for the year ended September 24, 2010. Net revenue for Tyco Fire Protection of $4.7 billion increased by $233 million, or 5.2%, during the year ended September 30, 2011, as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net revenue by $126 million, or 2.8%. In addition, an estimated $60 million, or 1.3% of revenue is attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2011, while the deconsolidation of a joint venture in our Fire Protection services business as a result of adopting a new accounting standard unfavorably impacted net revenue by $72 million, or 1.6%. The remaining increase in revenue was primarily driven by increased volume in product sales as a result of generally improved end market demand, implementation of pricing actions to offset commodity inflationary pressures, increased services revenue as a result of continued focus on driving recurring revenue and continued emerging markets expansion, partially offset by a decline in systems installation revenue as a result of project selectivity across all regions. Net revenue for Tyco Fire Protection decreased $110 million, or 2.4%, during the year ended September 24, 2010 compared to the year ended September 25, 2009. Net revenue was unfavorably impacted by acquisitions and divestitures of $37 million, or 0.8%. Net revenue was favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $130 million, or 2.8%. The remaining decrease was primarily due to weakness in commercial markets and project selectivity resulting from a focus on higher margin projects. 45 Table of Contents Revenue from product sales Systems installation and related products Revenue from product sales includes sales and installation of fire protection and other systems. Revenue from systems installation decreased by $4 million, or 0.2%, during the year ended September 30, 2011, as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted systems installation revenue by $45 million, or 2.8%, while the deconsolidation of a joint venture discussed above unfavorably impacted systems installation by $51 million, or 3.1%. Revenue from systems installation was also unfavorably impacted by project selectivity resulting from a focus on higher margin projects across all regions. Revenue from systems installation decreased by $123 million, or 7.1%, during the year ended September 24, 2010, as compared to the year ended September 25, 2009. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted systems installation revenue by $56 million, or 3.2%. Despite the favorable impact of foreign currency, revenue decreased due to decreased upgrade activity from customers, and project selectivity resulting from a focus on higher margin project across all regions. Product sales Revenue from product sales increased by $164 million, or 14.2%, during the year ended September 30, 2011, as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted product revenue by $24 million, or 2.1%. The remaining increase in net revenue was driven by increased volumes due to improved end market demand and implementation of pricing actions to offset commodity inflationary pressures. Revenue from product sales decreased by $50 million, or 4.1%, during the year ended September 24, 2010, as compared to the year ended September 25, 2009. Product revenue was unfavorably impacted by the estimated impact of $32 million, or 2.7% of divestitures. This decrease was partially offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates which favorably impacted product revenue by $13 million, or 1.1%. The remaining decrease was due to weakness in end market demand. Service revenue Service revenue consists of inspection, maintenance, monitoring and repair of fire detection, suppression and other life safety systems. Service revenue increased by $73 million, or 4.2%, during the year ended September 30, 2011, as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted service revenue by $56 million, or 3.2%, while the deconsolidation of a joint venture discussed above unfavorably impacted service revenue by $21 million, or 1.2%. The remaining increase in service revenue was as a result of managements continued focus on expanding our recurring service revenue across all regions. Service revenue increased by $63 million, or 3.8%, during the year ended September 24, 2010, as compared to the year ended September 25, 2009. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted service revenue by $61 million, or 3.7%. Despite the favorable impact of foreign currency, service revenue was flat due primarily to weakness in the European markets. Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income and operating margin for Tyco Fire Protection were as follows ($ in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Operating income $ 534 $ 460 $ 20 Operating margin 11.3 % 10.2 % (1) (1)Certain operating margins and percentages have not been presented as management believes such calculations are not meaningful. 46 Table of Contents Operating income of $534 million increased $74 million, or 16.1%, for the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted operating income by $15 million, or 3.3%. Other factors that contributed to the net increase in operating income and operating margin were increased sales volume, implementation of pricing actions to offset commodity inflationary pressures in the products business, project selectivity in the systems installation business, and cost containment initiatives. These increases were partially offset by additional environmental remediation costs of $11 million, net of recoveries related to an isolated site, and a $5 million decrease to operating income related to the deconsolidation of a joint venture. Included in operating income for the prior year comparable period is a curtailment gain of $8 million, which was recognized upon the freezing of certain defined benefit plans in the United Kingdom. Included in operating income for the year ended September 30, 2011 was $38 million of restructuring charges, net as compared to $42 million of restructuring charges, net for the year ended September 24, 2010. Included in operating income for the year ended September 30, 2011 was $29 million of losses on divestitures as compared to $2 million of losses on divestitures for the year ended September 24, 2010. Operating income increased $440 million during the year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to the year ended September 25, 2009. Operating income during the year ended September 25, 2009 was negatively affected by a goodwill impairment charge of $420 million recorded at the EMEA Fire and Life Safety reporting units. Additionally, operating income in 2010 was favorably impacted by savings realized through cost containment actions, $14 million of favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and to a lesser extent, a curtailment gain of approximately $8 million recognized when certain defined benefit pension plans were frozen in the United Kingdom. There were $42 million of restructuring charges, net and a loss on divestiture of $2 million during the year ended September 24, 2010, compared with $62 million of restructuring charges, net and nil of divestiture charges incurred in 2009. Additionally, management estimates that $7 million of additional charges resulting from restructuring actions were incurred during 2009. Operating income in 2009 was also unfavorably affected by the decreased sales volume discussed above. Tyco Flow Control Net Revenue Net revenue for Tyco Flow Control for the years ended September 30, 2011, September 24, 2010, and September 25, 2009 were as follows ($ in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Revenue from product sales $ 3,330 $ 3,089 $ 3,232 Service revenue 309 284 263 Net revenue $ 3,639 $ 3,373 $ 3,495 Net revenue for Tyco Flow Control of $3.6 billion increased by $266 million, or 7.9%, during the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010. The increase in revenue was primarily due to favorable impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $183 million, or 5.4%. In addition, an estimated $45 million, or 1.3%, of revenue is attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2011. Net revenue was favorably impacted by the estimated net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of $7 million, or 0.2%. The remaining increase was primarily due to continued strength in end market demand in our Valves and Controls and Thermal Controls businesses partially offset by weakness in our Water and Environmental Systems business. The decreased revenue in our Water and Environmental Systems business was primarily due to the completion of a large desalinization project in Australia that commenced during the second quarter of fiscal 2010, and was completed at the beginning of the second quarter fiscal 2011. 47 Table of Contents Net revenue for Tyco Flow Control of $3.4 billion decreased by $122 million, or 3.5%, during the year ended year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to the year ended September 25, 2009. Net revenue was favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $218 million, or 6.2%, as well as the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of $10 million, or 0.3%. This was more than offset by decreased revenues due to reduced volume in the Valves and Controls business driven by decreased demand in end markets. Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income and operating margin for Tyco Flow Control for the years ended September 30, 2011, September 24, 2010, and September 25, 2009 were as follows ($ in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Operating income $ 413 $ 410 $ 496 Operating margin 11.3 % 12.2 % 14.2 % Operating income of $413 million increased by $3 million, or 0.7%, in the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended September 24, 2010. Operating income was favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $22 million, or 5.4%. The increase in operating income was primarily due to continued strength in the Valves and Controls and Thermal Controls businesses, which was more than offset by weakness in our Water and Environmental Systems business. Restructuring charges, net were $11 million during the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to $25 million in the prior year. The year ended September 30, 2011 included a $6 million gain on divestiture, compared to a $1 million gain on divestiture for the year ended September 24, 2010. Operating income of $410 million decreased by $86 million, or 17.3%, during the year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to the year ended September 25, 2009, primarily due to decreased volume in our valves business and an expected loss related to completion of a long term construction project of approximately $18 million. These declines were partially offset by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $31 million, or 6.3%. The decline in operating income was also partially offset by savings realized through cost containment and restructuring actions. Operating income was unfavorably impacted by $24 million of restructuring and divestiture charges, net during both fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009. Additionally, management estimated that $5 million of additional charges resulting from restructuring actions were incurred during the year ended September 25, 2009. Corporate and Other Corporate expense decreased $266 million, or 57.6%, to $196 million for the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to an expense of $462 million for the year ended September 24, 2010. The decrease in corporate expense during the year ended September 30, 2011 is related to a $253 million net gain on divestitures, primarily related to the divestiture of our Electrical and Metal Products business, compared to a $4 million net loss on divestitures during the year ended September 24, 2010. Corporate expense was also favorably impacted by cost containment initiatives during the year ended September 30, 2011, as well as a lower net asbestos charge of $11 million recorded in connection with the Companys valuation of its asbestos related liabilities during the year ended September 30, 2011 compared to a $52 million, net asbestos charge recorded during the year ended September 24, 2010. Corporate also recorded a $20 million charge in relation to a legacy legal matter during the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to nil during the year ended September 24, 2010. Additionally, net restructuring charges and acquisition charges for the year ended September 30, 2011 were $12 million and $1 million respectively, while the year ended September 24, 2010 included restructuring charges and acquisition charges of $1 million and $3 million, respectively. The year ended September 30, 2011 included $24 million of separation costs primarily related to 48 Table of Contents professional fees and banking services. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Corporate expense decreased $108 million, or 18.9%, to $462 million for year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to $570 million for the year ended September 25, 2009. Corporate expense during 2009 was negatively affected by approximately $125 million of charges related to legacy securities matters partially offset by a $16 million benefit related to a settlement reached with a former executive. Restructuring charges decreased to $1 million for the year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to $10 million in the year ended September 25, 2009. Corporate expense was also favorably impacted by savings realized through cost containment and restructuring charges. These decreases in Corporate expenses were partially offset by a $52 million net asbestos charge recorded during the third quarter of 2010 as compared to a $37 million net asbestos charge in 2009, both of which were recorded in conjunction with the valuation of our asbestos related liabilities and insurance assets. In addition, $4 million of divestiture charges, net, and $3 million of acquisition costs were recorded during the year ended September 24, 2010 as compared to $6 million of divestiture charges, net, and nil of acquisition costs for the year ended September 25, 2009. Interest Income and Expense Interest income was $34 million in 2011, as compared to $31 million and $44 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Interest income increased in 2011 primarily due to increased investment yields compared to 2010, while investment yields continue to be lower than those experienced in 2009. Interest expense was $244 million in 2011, as compared to $284 million and $301 million in 2010 and in 2009, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on total debt outstanding as of September 30, 2011, September 24, 2010, September 25, 2009 was 5.9%, 6.3% and 6.6%, respectively. The decreases in interest expense and weighted average interest rate are primarily related to savings realized from the replacement of higher coupon notes with lower coupon notes over the past year, including the redemption of 6.375% notes due 2011 and issuance of 3.375% notes due 2015 during the third quarter of 2010 and the maturity of 6.75% notes due 2011 and issuances of the 3.75% notes due 2018 and 4.625% notes due 2023 during the second quarter of 2011. Other Expense, Net Other expense, net of $16 million in 2011, primarily relates to our share of Atkores net loss of $9 million, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting, and a decrease in the receivables due from Covidien and TE Connectivity under the Tax Sharing Agreement of $7 million. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other expense, net of $75 million in 2010, primarily related to a charge of $87 million as a loss on extinguishment of debt on the redemption of our 6.375% public notes due 2011, 7% notes due 2028 and 6.875% notes due 2029. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This loss was partially offset by an $8 million gain recorded as a result of an increase in the receivables due from Covidien and TE Connectivity under the Tax Sharing Agreement. Other expense, net of $7 million in 2009, primarily related to a $14 million charge recorded as a result of a decrease in the receivables due from Covidien and TE Connectivity under the Tax Sharing Agreement, which was partially offset by income of $5 million relating to a gain on derivative contracts used to economically hedge the foreign currency risk related to the Swiss franc denominated dividends. Effective Income Tax Rate Our effective income tax rate was 17.2% and 10.9% during the years ended September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively. The increase in our effective income tax rate was primarily 49 Table of Contents related to the tax charge recorded in conjunction with the sale of a majority interest in our Electrical and Metal Products business during the first quarter of 2011, a non recurring transaction generating a tax benefit in 2010 and a release of a deferred tax valuation allowance in 2010. The effective income tax rate was positively impacted by favorable audit resolutions in multiple jurisdictions during 2011. The rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to discrete items such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, as well as recurring factors, such as the geographic mix of income before taxes. The effective income tax rate for 2009 is not meaningful primarily as a result of the loss driven by goodwill impairment charges of $2.6 billion for which almost no tax benefit was available. Additionally, taxes for 2009 were positively impacted by increased profitability in lower tax rate jurisdictions and release of contingency reserves partially offset by enacted tax law changes and changes in foreign exchange rates that negatively impacted the non U.S. deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $1,400 million and $1,379 million as of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. The valuation allowance was calculated and recorded when the Company determined that it was more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets would not be realized. The Company believes that it will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as payment is not expected within one year. 2009 Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairments Annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, and more frequently if triggering events occur, we test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible assets with its carrying amount. We began to experience a decline in revenue during the first quarter of 2009 in our Tyco Security Solutions and Tyco Fire Protection segments as a result of a slowdown in the commercial markets, including the retailer end market as well as a decline in sales volume at our Electrical Metal Products segments. Although we considered and concluded that these factors did not constitute triggering events during the first quarter of 2009, the continued existence of these conditions during the second quarter of 2009, along with downward revisions to forecasted results, restructuring actions and weaker industry outlooks, caused us to conclude that sufficient indicators of impairment existed. Reporting units within our Tyco Security Solutions and Tyco Fire Protection segments continued to be negatively impacted as a result of a slowdown in the commercial markets including the retailer end market. Additionally, our Electrical Metal Products reporting unit continued to be negatively impacted by a decline in sales volume due to the downturn in the non residential construction market. We determined that these underlying events and circumstances constituted triggering events for six reporting units where such events would more likely than not reduce the fair value below their respective carrying amounts. Specifically, we concluded that our EMEA Security, ACVS and Sensormatic Retail Solutions ("SRS") reporting units within the Tyco Security Solutions segment the EMEA Fire and Life Safety reporting units within the Tyco Fire Protection segment and our Electrical and Metal Products reporting unit 50 Table of Contents within the Electrical and Metal Products segment experienced triggering events such that the carrying values of these reporting units likely exceeded their fair values. Furthermore, we determined that certain indefinite lived intangible assets required impairment testing based on the underlying events and circumstances described as well as the continued deterioration of the business environment related to the retailer end market of our Tyco Security Solutions segments. As a result of the triggering events, we performed long lived asset, goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests for these reporting units and certain of our trade names and franchise rights. Fair value of each reporting unit was determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on forecast cash flows (including underlying revenue and operating income growth rates) discounted using an estimated weighted average cost of capital of market participants. In determining fair value, management relied on and considered a number of factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections including the timing for an economic recovery, cash flow forecasts, market data, and our overall market capitalization. Based on the factors described above, actual and anticipated reductions in demand for the reporting units products and services as well as increased risk due to economic uncertainty, the estimates of future cash flows used in the second quarter of 2009 discounted cash flow analyses were revised downward from our most recent test conducted during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2008. Furthermore, the range of the weighted average cost of capital utilized was increased to reflect increased risk due to economic volatility and uncertainties related to demand for our products and services. The results of the goodwill impairment tests indicated that the implied goodwill amount was less than the carrying amount of goodwill for each of the aforementioned reporting units. We recorded an aggregate non cash impairment charge of $2.6 billion ($2.6 billion after tax) during the second quarter of 2009. The non cash impairment charge was recorded in goodwill and intangible asset impairments in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the quarter ended March 27, 2009. Indefinite lived intangible assets consisting primarily of trade names and franchise rights were tested for impairment using either a relief from royalty method or excess earnings method, which include the selection of appropriate discount rates, royalty rates and terminal year growth rate assumptions and estimates of the amount and timing of future cash flows attributable to the underlying intangible assets. Also, during the second quarter of 2009, our estimates of future cash flows used in determining the fair value of our Tyco Security Solutions segment Sensormatic tradename as well as certain Tyco Security Solutions segment franchise rights were revised downward relative to the estimates used in our tests during the fourth quarter of 2008. The results of the impairment test indicated that the Tyco Security Solutions Sensormatic tradename and Tyco Security Solutions franchise rights estimated fair values were less than their respective carrying amounts. As a result, we recorded an aggregate non cash impairment charge of $64 million ($40 million after tax) during the second quarter of 2009. The non cash impairment charge was recorded in goodwill and intangible asset impairments in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the quarter ended March 27, 2009.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. Depreciation and Amortization Methods for Security Monitoring Related Assets Tyco considers assets related to the acquisition of new customers in its electronic security business in three asset categories: internally generated residential subscriber systems, internally generated commercial subscriber systems (collectively referred to as subscriber system assets) and customer accounts acquired through the ADT dealer program (referred to as dealer intangibles). Subscriber system assets include installed property, 51 Table of Contents plant and equipment for which Tyco retains ownership and deferred costs directly related to the customer acquisition and system installation. Subscriber system assets and any deferred revenue resulting from the customer acquisition are accounted for over the expected life of the subscriber. In certain geographical areas where the Company has a large number of customers that behave in a similar manner over time, the Company accounts for subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue using pools, with separate pools for the components of subscriber system assets and any related deferred revenue based on the month and year of acquisition. The Company depreciates its pooled subscriber system assets (primarily in North America) and related deferred revenue using an accelerated method with lives up to 15 years. The accelerated method utilizes declining balance rates based on geographical area ranging from 160% to 265% for residential subscriber pools and 135% to 360% for commercial subscriber pools and converts to a straight line methodology when the resulting depreciation charge is greater than that from the accelerated method. The Company uses a straight line method with a 14 year life for non pooled subscriber system assets (primarily in Europe and Asia) and related deferred revenue, with remaining balances written off upon customer termination. Revenue Recognition Contract sales for the installation of fire protection systems, large security intruder systems and other construction related projects are recorded primarily under the percentage of completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related total cost of the project at completion. The risk of this methodology is its dependence upon estimates of costs at completion, which are subject to the uncertainties inherent in long term contracts. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they become determinable. Sales of security monitoring systems may have multiple elements, including equipment, installation, monitoring services and maintenance agreements. We assess our revenue arrangements to determine the appropriate units of accounting. When ownership of the system is transferred to the customer, each deliverable provided under the arrangement is considered a separate unit of accounting. Revenues associated with sale of equipment and related installations are recognized once delivery, installation and customer acceptance is completed, while the revenue for monitoring and maintenance services are recognized as services are rendered. Amounts assigned to each unit of accounting are based on an allocation of total arrangement consideration using a hierarchy of estimated selling price for the deliverables. The selling price used for each deliverable will be based on Vendor Specific Objective Evidence ("VSOE") if available, Third Party Evidence ("TPE") if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price if neither VSOE or TPE is available. Revenue recognized for equipment and installation is limited to the lesser of their allocated amounts under the estimated selling price hierarchy or the non contingent up front consideration received at the time of installation, since collection of future amounts under the arrangement with the customer is contingent upon the delivery of monitoring and maintenance services. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience and trend analysis. Loss Contingencies Accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings, self insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on judgment, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates. Additionally, the Company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. Asbestos Related Contingencies and Insurance Receivables We and certain of our subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials. We estimate the liability and corresponding insurance recovery for pending and future claims and defense costs predominantly based on claim experience 52 Table of Contents over the past five years, and a projection which covers claims expected to be filed, including related defense costs, over the next seven years on an undiscounted basis. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the pattern and length of time over which claims will be made and then settled or litigated, we use multiple estimation methodologies based on varying scenarios of potential outcomes to estimate the range of loss. We have concluded that estimating the liability beyond the seven year period will not provide a reasonable estimate, as these uncertainties increase significantly as the projection period lengthens. In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are probable. The estimate of asbestos related insurance recoveries represents estimated amounts due to us for previously paid and settled claims and the probable reimbursements relating to estimated liability for pending and future claims. In determining the amount of insurance recoverable, we consider available insurance, allocation methodologies, solvency and creditworthiness of the insurers. Annually, we perform a detailed analysis with the assistance of outside legal counsel and other experts to review and update as appropriate the underlying assumptions used in the estimated asbestos related assets and liabilities. On a quarterly basis, we re evaluate the assumptions used to perform the annual analysis and record an expense as necessary to reflect changes in the estimated liability and related insurance asset. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of managements judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of asbestos related assets and liabilities. Income Taxes In determining taxable income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future pre tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We currently have recorded valuation allowances that we will maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense recorded in the future may be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction. Any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance could result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management records the affect of a tax rate or law change on the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period of enactment. Future tax rate or law changes could have a material effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and 53 Table of Contents other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Asset Impairments Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually and more frequently if triggering events occur. In performing these assessments, management relies on various factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections including expectations and assumptions regarding the timing and degree of any economic recovery, anticipated future cash flows, comparable market transactions (to the extent available) and other market data. We elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for all goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. In the first step of the goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. Fair value for the goodwill impairment test is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on forecast cash flows (including estimated underlying revenue and operating income growth rates) discounted using an estimated weighted average cost of capital for market participants. A market approach, utilizing observable market data such as comparable companies in similar lines of business that are publicly traded or which are part of a public or private transaction (to the extent available), is used to corroborate the discounted cash flow analysis performed at each reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered potentially impaired and further tests are performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. In the second step of the goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill. We recorded no goodwill impairments in conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment assessment performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Additionally, we determined as part of the assessment that our Water and Environmental Systems reporting unit within our Flow Control segment had limited recoverability of goodwill. The fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 6.9%. As of September 30, 2011, the Water and Environmental Systems goodwill balance was $298 million. While historical performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values of goodwill in excess of carrying values, if our assumptions are not realized, it is possible that in the future an impairment charge may need to be recorded. However, it is not possible at this time to determine if an impairment charge would result or if such a charge would be material. The Company will continue to monitor the recoverability of its goodwill. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the 54 Table of Contents underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of the aforementioned reporting units may include such items as follows: A prolonged downturn in the business environment in which the reporting units operate (i.e. sales volumes and prices) especially in the commercial construction and retailer end markets; An economic recovery that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing or degree; Volatility in equity and debt markets resulting in higher discount rates; and Unexpected regulatory changes. While historical performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values of goodwill in excess of carrying values, if our assumptions are not realized, it is possible that in the future an impairment charge may need to be recorded. However, it is not possible at this time to determine if an impairment charge would result or if such a charge would be material. Long Lived Assets Asset groups held and used by the Company, including property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be fully recoverable. Tyco performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if impairment exists. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, Tyco groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identified. If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Impairments to long lived assets to be disposed of are recorded based upon the fair value less cost to sell of the applicable assets. The calculation of the fair value of long lived assets is based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of long lived assets, there is a risk that the carrying value of our long lived assets may be overstated or understated. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations. Two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions resulting in actuarial gains and losses. For active plans, such actuarial gains and losses will be amortized over the average expected service period of the participants and in the case of inactive plans over the average remaining life expectancy of participants. The discount rate represents the market rate for high quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of pension obligations by approximately $75 million and increase our annual pension expense by approximately $2 million. We consider the relative weighting of plan assets by class, historical performance of asset classes over long term periods, asset class performance expectations as well as current and future economic conditions in determining the expected long term return on plan assets. A 25 basis point decrease in the expected long term return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately $4 million. 55  Table of Contents  Liquidity and Capital Resources A fundamental objective of the Company is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of its core businesses around the world. The primary source of funds to finance our operations and capital expenditures is cash generated by operations. In addition, we maintain a commercial paper program, have access to committed revolving credit facilities and have access to equity and debt capital from public and private sources. We continue to balance our operating, investing and financing uses of cash through investments and acquisitions in our core businesses, dividends and share repurchases. In addition, we currently estimate that we will incur approximately $700 million in costs related to the 2012 Separation. We believe our cash position, amounts available under our credit facilities and cash provided by operating activities will be adequate to cover our operational and business needs in the foreseeable future. We had $1.4 billion and $1.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively. Cash generated by operating activities decreased to $2.4 billion for the year ended September 30, 2011 compared to $2.6 billion for the year ended September 24, 2010. Cash used in investing activities was $1.3 billion for the year ended September 30, 2011 compared to $1.8 billion for the year ended September 24, 2010. Cash used in financing activities was $1.5 billion for the year ended September 30, 2011 compared to $1.4 billion for the year ended September 24, 2010. As of September 30, 2011, our shareholders equity was $14.2 billion and our total debt was $4.1 billion. In addition, we had lines of credit totaling approximately $1.5 billion, none of which were drawn. Our ratio of total debt to total capital (the sum of our short and long term debt and shareholders equity) was 23% as of both September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively. This ratio is a measure of our long term liquidity and is an indicator of financial flexibility. On January 12, 2011, TIFSA, our finance subsidiary, issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% notes due on January 15, 2018 and $250 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% notes due on January 15, 2023, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. TIFSA received net cash proceeds of approximately $494 million. The net proceeds, along with other available funds, were used to fund the repayment of all of our outstanding 6.75% notes due in February 2011 with a principal amount of $516 million. On March 24, 2011, TIFSA, as the Borrower, and the Company as the Guarantor, entered into a Four Year Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement, providing for revolving credit commitments in the aggregate amount of $750 million (the "Credit Agreement"). In connection with entering into the Credit Agreement, TIFSA and the Company terminated the existing Three Year Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement, dated June 24, 2008, which provided for revolving credit commitments in the aggregate amount of $500 million, and which was scheduled to expire in June 2011. At the same time, TIFSA also reduced the lenders commitments under its existing Five Year Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement, dated April 25, 2007, from an aggregate of $1.19 billion to $750 million, and which is scheduled to expire in April 2012. 56 Table of Contents Cash flow from operating activities The sources of our cash flow from operating activities and the use of a portion of that cash in our operations for the years ended September 30, 2011, September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009 are as follows ($ in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Cash flows from operating activities: Operating income (loss) $ 2,119 $ 1,598 $ (1,506 ) Goodwill and intangible asset impairments 2,705 Depreciation and amortization(1) 1,318 1,203 1,126 (Gain) loss on divestitures (230 ) (41 ) 13 Non cash compensation expense 110 120 103 Deferred income taxes 91 (129 ) (90 ) Provision for losses on accounts receivable and inventory 82 127 156 Other, net 67 37 80 Net change in working capital (584 ) 106 128 Interest income 34 31 44 Interest expense (244 ) (284 ) (301 ) Income tax expense (326 ) (138 ) (71 ) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,437 $ 2,630 $ 2,387 Other cash flow items: Capital expenditures, net(2) $ (779 ) $ (689 ) $ (690 ) Increase (decrease) in the sale of accounts receivable 1 (2 ) 10 Accounts purchased by ADT (614 ) (559 ) (543 ) Purchase accounting and holdback liabilities (10 ) (3 ) (2 ) Voluntary pension contributions 15 22 (1)Includes depreciation expense of $695 million, $654 million, and $610 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and amortization of intangible assets of $623 million, $549 million, and $516 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. (2)Includes net proceeds received for the sale/disposition of property, plant and equipment of $9 million, $29 million, and $12 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively The net change in working capital decreased operating cash flow by $584 million in 2011. The significant changes in working capital included a $271 million decrease in accrued and other liabilities, a $187 million increase in accounts receivable and a $137 million increase in inventories. The net change in working capital increased operating cash flow by $106 million in 2010. The significant changes in working capital included a $119 million increase in accounts payable and an $88 million decrease in prepaid and other current assets which were partially offset by a $108 million increase in inventories. The net change in working capital increased operating cash flow by $128 million in 2009. The significant changes in working capital included a $346 million decrease in inventory, a $191 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $106 million net decrease in contracts in progress, partially offset by a $337 million decrease in accounts payable and a $138 million decrease in income taxes, net. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, we paid approximately $114 million, $160 million (inclusive of $2 million relating to the French security business being classified as held for sale) and $152 million, respectively, in cash related to restructuring activities. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our restructuring activities. During the years ended September 30, 2011, September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009 we made required contributions of $78 million, $82 million and $60 million, respectively to our U.S. and 57 Table of Contents non U.S. pension plans. We also made voluntary contributions of approximately $15 million, nil and $22 million to our U.S. plans during the years ended September 30, 2011, September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009. We anticipate contributing at least the minimum required to our pension plans in fiscal year 2012 of $44 million for our U.S. plans and $60 million for our non U.S. plans. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, related to continuing operations were $196 million, $255 million, and $281 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net interest paid, related to continuing operations were $195 million, $234 million, and $249 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Cash flow from investing activities We made capital expenditures of $788 million, $718 million, and $702 million during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The level of capital expenditures in fiscal year 2012 is expected to exceed the spending levels in fiscal year 2011 and is also expected to exceed depreciation expense. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, we paid approximately $614 million, $559 million, and $543 million of cash, respectively, to acquire approximately 565,000, 501,000 and 512,000 customer contracts for electronic security services within our Tyco Security Solutions segment. During 2011, we paid cash for acquisitions included in continuing operations totaling $656 million, net of cash acquired of $4 million, which primarily related to the acquisitions of Signature Security Group within our Tyco Security Solutions segment, KEF Holdings Ltd. within our Tyco Flow Control segment and Chemguard within our Tyco Fire Protection segment. During 2010, cash paid for acquisitions included in continuing operations totaled $600 million, net of cash acquired of $137 million, which primarily related to the acquisition of Broadview Security within our Tyco Security Solutions segment and Hiter within our Tyco Flow Control segment. During 2011, we received cash proceeds, net of cash divested of approximately $1 billion for divestitures. The cash proceeds primarily related to the sale of a majority interest in our Electrical and Metal Products business of $713 million, which is presented in continuing operations and $264 million for the sale of our European water business which is presented in discontinued operations. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Cash flow from financing activities On January 12, 2011, TIFSA, our finance subsidiary, issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% notes due on January 15, 2018 and $250 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% notes due on January 15, 2023, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. TIFSA received net cash proceeds of approximately $494 million after deducting debt issuance costs and a debt discount. The net proceeds, along with other available funds, were used to fund the repayment of all of our outstanding 6.75% notes due in February 2011 with a principal amount of $516 million. In connection with the acquisition of KEF during the year ended September 30, 2011, the Company acquired $64 million of debt which was substantially paid as of September 30, 2011. During the second half of fiscal 2011, TIFSA issued commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2011, TIFSA had no commercial paper outstanding. During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, TIFSA had made payments of $200 million to extinguish all of its commercial paper outstanding. On May 5, 2010, TIFSA issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375% notes due, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. TIFSA received net proceeds of 58 Table of Contents approximately $495 million after deducting debt issuance costs and a debt discount. On May 28, 2010, the Company used the net proceeds of the aforementioned offering and additional cash on hand to redeem all of its 6.375% public notes due 2011, 7% notes due 2028 and 6.875% notes due 2029, outstanding at that time, which aggregated $878 million in principal amount. On October 5, 2009, TIFSA issued $500 million aggregate principle amount of 4.125% notes due 2014, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. TIFSA received net proceeds of approximately $495 million after deducting debt issuance costs and a debt discount.

TIFSA received net proceeds of approximately $745 million after underwriting discounts and offering expenses. On January 15, 2009, TIFSA made a payment of $215 million to extinguish all of its 6.125% notes, due 2009 which matured on the same date. Additionally, in November 2008, TIFSA made a payment of $300 million to extinguish all of its 6.125% notes due 2008. Pursuant to our share repurchase program, we may repurchase Tyco shares from time to time in open market purchases at prevailing market prices, in negotiated transactions off the market, or pursuant to an approved 10b5 1 trading plan in accordance with applicable regulations. During the year ended September 30, 2011, we repurchased approximately 30 million common shares for approximately $1.3 billion under the 2011, 2010 and 2008 share repurchase programs, which completed both the 2010 and 2008 programs. During the year ended September 24, 2010, we repurchased approximately 24 million common shares for approximately $900 million under the 2008 share repurchase program. On March 9, 2011, our shareholders approved an annual dividend on our common shares of $1.00 per share, to be paid from contributed surplus in four installments of $0.25 per share. During the 2011, 2010 and 2009 fiscal years, we paid cash dividends of approximately $458 million, $416 million and $388 million, respectively. See Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Management believes that cash generated by or available to us should be sufficient to fund our capital and operational business needs for the foreseeable future, including capital expenditures, quarterly dividend payments, share repurchases and separation related expenses. Commitments and Contingencies For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to tax and litigation matters and governmental investigations, see Notes 7 and 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations and commitments for debt, minimum lease payment obligations under non cancellable operating leases and obligations as of September 30, 2011 are as follows ($ in millions): Fiscal Year 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total Debt principal(1) $ $ $ 656 $ 500 $ 500 $ 2,379 $ 4,035 Interest payments(2) 240 240 220 190 171 571 1,632 Capital leases(3) 3 4 5 6 8 30 56 Operating leases 228 179 133 105 62 143 850 Purchase obligations(4) 492 32 5 1 530 Total contractual cash obligations(5) $ 963 $ 455 $ 1,019 $ 802 $ 741 $ 3,123 $ 7,103 (1)Excludes debt discount, swap activity and interest. 59 Table of Contents (2)Interest payments consist of interest on our fixed interest rate debt and exclude the impact of our interest rate swaps. As of September 30, 2011, we had swapped an aggregate of approximately $1.2 billion of fixed for floating rate debt. (3)Excludes interest. (4)Purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of goods and services. (5)Other long term liabilities excluded from the above contractual obligation table primarily consist of the following: pension and postretirement costs, income taxes, warranties and environmental liabilities. We are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items due to the inherent uncertainties related to these obligations. However, the minimum required contributions to our pension plans are expected to be approximately $104 million in 2012 and we expect to pay $5 million in 2012 related to postretirement benefit plans. As of September 30, 2011, we recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $270 million and gross interest and penalties of $60 million. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing for the remaining payments in future years; therefore, such amounts have been excluded from the above contractual obligation table. However, based on the current status of our income tax audits, we believe that is reasonably possible that between nil and $60 million in unrecognized tax benefits may be resolved in the next twelve months. As of September 30, 2011, we had total commitments of $1.5 billion under our revolving credit facilities, $750 million of which expires on March 24, 2015 and $750 million of which expires on April 25, 2012. As of September 30, 2011, there were no amounts drawn under these revolving credit facilities. TIFSAs bank credit agreements contain customary terms and conditions, and financial covenants that limit the ratio of our debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and that limit our ability to incur subsidiary debt or grant liens on our property. Our indentures contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges, subsidiary debt and sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are considered restrictive to our business. During the second half of fiscal 2011, TIFSA, the Companys finance subsidiary, issued commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, TIFSA had no commercial paper outstanding. In the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In connection with the 2007 Separation, we entered into a liability sharing agreement regarding certain actions that were pending against Tyco prior to the 2007 Separation. Under the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, we have assumed 27%, Covidien has assumed 42% and TE Connectivity has assumed 31% of certain Tyco pre Separation contingent and other corporate liabilities, which, as of September 30, 2011, primarily relate to tax contingencies and potential actions with respect to the spin offs or the distributions made or brought by any third party. Backlog We had a backlog of unfilled orders of $9.7 billion and $9.5 billion as of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively. We expect that approximately 88% of our backlog as of 60 Table of Contents September 30, 2011 will be filled during the next 12 months. Backlog by segment was as follows ($ in millions): September 30, 2011 September 24, 2010 Tyco Security Solutions $ 6,776 $ 6,610 Tyco Flow Control 1,744 1,482 Tyco Fire Protection 1,131 1,296 Electrical and Metal Products 88 $ 9,651 $ 9,476 Backlog increased $175 million, or 1.8%, to $9.7 billion as of September 30, 2011. The net increase in backlog was primarily related to an increase in recurring revenue in force in our Tyco Security Solutions segment and increased bookings in our Tyco Flow Control segment. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in bookings in our Tyco Fire Protection segment. Tyco Security Solutions backlog includes recurring revenue in force and long term deferred revenue for upfront fees paid by customers for Tyco Security Solutions owned security systems. Revenue in force represents 12 months revenue associated with monitoring and maintenance services under contract in the security business. Tyco Security Solutions backlog of $6.8 billion and $6.6 billion as of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively, consists primarily of $4.9 billion and $4.8 billion of recurring revenue in force as of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively, and $1.1 billion of deferred revenue for both September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010. Tyco Security Solutions backlog increased $166 million, or 2.5%. The net increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue in force, partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates by $36 million, or 0.5%. Tyco Flow Controls backlog increased by $262 million, or 17.7%. The net increase was primarily due to increased bookings for several large projects within our Valves and Controls and Thermal Controls businesses. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted Tyco Flow Controls backlog by $7 million, or 0.5%. These increases were partially offset by a decline in bookings in our Water and Environmental Systems business. Tyco Fire Protections backlog decreased by $165 million, or 12.7%. Tyco Fire Protections backlog was unfavorably impacted by the deconsolidation of a joint venture as a result of adopting a new accounting standard. In addition, backlog decreased in EMEA as a result of project selectivity resulting from a focus on higher margin projects. These decreases were partially offset by increases in our North American and global Fire Safety Products businesses. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates also favorably impacted Tyco Fire Protections backlog by $17 million, or 1.3%.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale of Accounts Receivable Certain of our international businesses utilize the sale of accounts receivable as short term financing mechanisms. The aggregate amount outstanding under our international accounts receivable programs was not material as of September 30, 2011 or September 24, 2010. Guarantees Certain of our business segments have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from the current fiscal year through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would typically be triggered in the event of nonperformance and performance under the guarantees, if required, would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 61 Table of Contents There are certain guarantees or indemnifications extended among Tyco, Covidien and TE Connectivity in accordance with the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Tax Sharing Agreement. The guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the Tax Sharing Agreement. At the time of the 2007 Separation, we recorded a liability necessary to recognize the fair value of such guarantees and indemnifications. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Tax Sharing Agreement. In addition, prior to the 2007 Separation we provided support in the form of financial and or performance guarantees to various Covidien and TE Connectivity operating entities. To the extent these guarantees were not assigned in connection with the 2007 Separation, we assumed primary liability on any remaining such support. These obligations were not material to us as of September 30, 2011. In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these liabilities. In the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. We record estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As of September 30, 2011, we had total outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees of approximately $724 million. For a detailed discussion of guarantees and indemnifications, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of conducting business, we are exposed to certain risks associated with potential changes in market conditions. These risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Accordingly, we have established a comprehensive risk management process to monitor, evaluate and manage the principal exposures to which we believe we are subject. We seek to manage these risks through the use of financial derivative instruments. Our portfolio of derivative financial instruments may, from time to time, include forward foreign currency exchange contracts, foreign currency options, interest rate swaps, commodity swaps and forward commodity contracts. Derivative financial instruments related to interest rate sensitivity of debt obligations, intercompany cross border transactions and anticipated non functional currency cash flows are used with the goal of mitigating a significant portion of these exposures when it is cost effective to do so. We do not execute transactions or utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, to reduce the risk that a counterparty will be unable to honor its contractual obligations to us, we only enter into contracts with counterparties having at least an A /A3 long term debt rating. These counterparties are generally financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one party. Foreign Currency Exposures We hedge our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates through the use of forward foreign currency exchange contracts. During 2011, our largest exposures to foreign exchange rates existed primarily with the Swiss franc, British pound, Euro, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. The market risk related to the forward foreign currency exchange contracts is measured by estimating the potential impact of a 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates. The rates used to perform this analysis were based on the market rates in effect on September 30, 2011. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in a $32 million net decrease in the fair value of the contracts. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in a $39 million net increase in the fair value of the contracts. However, gains or losses on these derivative instruments are economically offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. During the third quarter of 2010, Tyco International Finance, S.A. ("TIFSA"), the Companys finance subsidiary, entered into foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge its Euro denominated net investment. The aggregate notional amount of these hedges was approximately $224 million and $255 million as of September 30, 2011, and September 24, 2010, respectively. The potential impact from a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro would result in a $19 million net increase in other comprehensive income. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro would result in a $24 million net decrease in other comprehensive income. As of September 30, 2011, and September 24, 2010, $2.9 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, of intercompany loans have been designated as permanent in nature. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011, September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, we recorded $16 million of cumulative transaction gain, $24 million of cumulative translation loss and nil, respectively, through accumulated other comprehensive loss related to these loans. 64  Table of Contents Interest Rate Exposures Our long term debt portfolio primarily consists of fixed rate instruments. The Company manages its interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swap transactions with financial institutions acting as principal counterparties, which were designated as fair value hedges for accounting purposes. These interest rate swap transactions manage the exposure to interest rate risk by converting interest rates of fixed rate debt to variable rates. During the second quarter of 2011, TIFSA also entered into interest rate swaps contracts to hedge $155 million notional amount of the 4.125% public notes due 2014. In these contracts, TIFSA agrees with financial institutions acting as principal counterparties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated on an agreed upon notional principal amount. In connection with the maturity of the 6.75% public notes during the second quarter of 2011, TIFSA settled the corresponding interest rate swaps. As of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, the total gross notional amount of the Companys interest rate swap contracts was $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates as of September 30, 2011 would result in a $29 million net decrease in the fair value of the contracts. Conversely, a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates as of September 30, 2011 would result in a $30 million net increase in the fair value of the contracts. Commodity Exposures We are exposed to volatility in the prices of raw materials used in some of our products and may, in limited circumstances, enter into hedging contracts to manage those exposures. These exposures are monitored as an integral part of our risk management program. During 2011 and 2010, the Company entered into commodity swaps for copper which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. These swaps did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the price of copper as of September 30, 2011 would not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 65 Table of Contents
