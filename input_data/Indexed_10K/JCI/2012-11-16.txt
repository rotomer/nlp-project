Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the Companys financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the Selected Financial Data and our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The Companys actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those under the headings "Risk Factors" and "Forward Looking Information". Organization The Consolidated Financial Statements include the consolidated results of Tyco International Ltd., a company organized under the laws of Switzerland, and its subsidiaries (hereinafter collectively referred to as "we", the "Company" or "Tyco"). The financial statements have been prepared in United States dollars ("USD"), in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). Effective September 28, 2012, Tyco completed the spin offs of The ADT Corporation ("ADT") and Pentair Ltd. (formerly known as Tyco Flow Control International Ltd. ("Tyco Flow Control")), formerly our North American residential security and flow control businesses, respectively, into separate, publicly traded companies in the form of a distribution to Tyco shareholders. Immediately following the spin off, Pentair, Inc. was merged with a subsidiary of Tyco Flow Control in a tax free, all stock merger ("the Merger"), with Pentair Ltd. ("Pentair") succeeding Pentair Inc. as an independent publicly traded company. The distribution was made on September 28, 2012, to Tyco shareholders of record on September 17, 2012. Each Tyco shareholder received 0.50 of a common share of ADT and approximately 0.24 of a common share of Pentair for each Tyco common share held on the record date. The distribution was structured to be tax free to Tyco shareholders except to the extent of cash received in lieu of fractional shares. The distributions, the Merger and related transactions are collectively referred to herein as the "2012 Separation". As a result of the distribution, the operations of Tycos former flow control and North American residential security businesses are now classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented. After giving effect to the 2012 Separation, we operate and report financial and operating information in the following three segments: North America Systems Installation & Services ("NA Installation & Services") designs, sells, installs, services and monitors electronic security systems and fire detection and suppression systems for commercial, industrial, retail, institutional and governmental customers in North America. Rest of World Systems Installation & Services ("ROW Installation & Services") designs, sells, installs, services and monitors electronic security systems and fire detection and suppression systems for commercial, industrial, retail, residential, small business, institutional and governmental customers in the Rest of World ("ROW") regions. Global Products designs, manufactures and sells fire protection, security and life safety products, including intrusion security, anti theft devices, breathing apparatus and access control and video management systems, for commercial, industrial, retail, residential, small business, institutional and governmental customers worldwide, including products installed and serviced by our NA and ROW Installation & Services segments. We also provide general corporate services to our segments which will be reported as a fourth, non operating segment, Corporate and Other. Additionally, Corporate and Other includes the 42 Table of Contents Companys former Electrical and Metal Products business which was divested in the first quarter of 2011. References to the segment data are to the Companys continuing operations. As discussed above, as a result of the 2012 Separation, the Company reports under a new segment structure beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and accordingly has recast prior period segment amounts. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Business Overview We are a leading global provider of security products and services, fire detection and suppression products and services and life safety products. We utilize our extensive global footprint of over 1,200 locations, including manufacturing facilities, service and distribution centers, monitoring centers and sales offices, to provide solutions and localized expertise to our global customer base. We provide an extensive range of product and service offerings to over 3 million customers in more than 100 countries through multiple channels. Our revenues are broadly diversified across the United States and Canada (collectively "North America"); Central America and South America (collectively "Latin America"); Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (collectively "EMEA") and the Asia Pacific region. We refer to Latin America, EMEA, and Asia Pacific region collectively as "Rest of World" or "ROW". The following chart reflects our fiscal 2012 net revenue by region.  Fiscal 2012 Net Revenue by Region Our end use customers, to whom we may sell directly or through wholesalers, distributors, commercial builders or contractors, are also broadly diversified and include: Commercial customers, including residential and commercial property developers, financial institutions, food service businesses and commercial enterprises; Industrial customers, including companies in the oil and gas, power generation, mining, petrochemical and other industries; Retail customers, including international, regional and local consumer outlets, from national chains to specialty stores; Institutional customers, including a broad range of healthcare facilities, academic institutions, museums and foundations; 43 Table of Contents Governmental customers, including federal, state and local governments, defense installations, mass transportation networks, public utilities and other government affiliated entities and applications; Residential and small business customers outside of North America, including owners of single family homes and local providers of a wide range of goods and services. As a global business with a varied customer base and an extensive range of products and services, our operations and results are impacted by global, regional and industry specific factors, and by political factors. Our geographic diversity and the diversity in our customer base and our products and services has helped mitigate the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on our consolidated operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Due to the global nature of our business and the variety of our customers, products and services, no single factor is predominantly used to forecast Company results. Rather, management monitors a number of factors to develop expectations regarding future results, including the activity of key competitors and customers, order rates for longer lead time projects, and capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our customers. We also monitor trends throughout the commercial and residential fire and security markets, including building codes and fire safety standards. Our commercial installation businesses are impacted by trends in commercial construction starts, while our residential business, which is located outside of North America, is impacted by new housing starts. Recent Transactions As a result of the 2012 Separation, we incurred and expect to continue to incur, separation related costs including debt refinancing, tax restructuring, professional services, restructuring and impairment charges and employee related costs. During 2012, the Company incurred pre tax costs related to the 2012 Separation of $561 million recorded within continuing operations and $278 million within discontinued operations. Costs incurred within continuing operations in fiscal 2012 include a charge of $453 million due to the early extinguishment of debt, as the Company refinanced its long term debt as a result of the 2012 Separation. During fiscal 2012, the Company paid $186 million in separation costs, $18 million of which is included within continuing operations. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we determined that certain aged receivables in our ROW Installation & Services segment related to security contracts in China may not be collectible. After a formal investigation, we determined that certain records relating to those receivables were falsified by district level employees located in one region of China. We have concluded that the revenue recognition practices related to the aged receivables, which dated back to fiscal 2008, were inappropriate. We have evaluated and concluded that the identified amounts were not material to any of our previously issued annual and interim financial statements, including the effects of presenting ADT and Tyco Flow Control as discontinued operations. Although management has determined the amounts individually and in the aggregate are not material to prior periods, in accordance with authoritative accounting literature on considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in the current year, the financial statements included herein have been adjusted to correct for the impact of these items. As a result, we have revised our previously reported operating results to reflect certain immaterial adjustments, primarily related to revenue recognition and cost of goods sold. These adjustments reduced previously reported net revenue by approximately $49 million and $37 million for fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively, and reduced previously reported operating income by approximately $14 million and $2 million for fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. See Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, we reversed approximately $31 million of net revenue and reduced operating 44 Table of Contents income by $17 million during fiscal 2012, of which less than $1 million and $7 million of net revenue and operating income, respectively, were recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Results of Operations Consolidated financial information is as follows: For the Years Ended ($ in millions) September 28, 2012 September 30, 2011 September 24, 2010 Net revenue $ 10,403 $ 10,557 (1) $ 11,020 (1) Net revenue decline (1.5 )% (4.2 )% NA Organic revenue growth 2.4 % 4.8 % NA Operating income $ 685 $ 982 (2) $ 615 (2) Operating margin 6.6 % 9.3 % 5.6 % Interest income $ 19 $ 27 $ 25 Interest expense 209 240 279 Other expense, net 454 5 76 Income tax (expense) benefit (348 ) (134 ) 17 Equity (loss) income in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries (26 ) (12 ) (1)Net revenue includes $347 million and $1.4 billion for 2011 and 2010, respectively, related to the Companys former Electrical and Metal Products business which was sold during the first quarter of fiscal 2011. (2)Operating income includes $7 million and $100 million for 2011 and 2010, respectively, related to the Companys former Electrical and Metal Products business, which was sold during the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Additionally, operating income for 2011 includes a $248 million net gain on that sale. Net Revenue: Fiscal 2012 Net revenue for the year ended September 28, 2012 decreased by $154 million, or 1.5%, to $10.4 billion as compared to net revenue of $10.6 billion for the year ended September 30, 2011. On an organic basis, net revenue grew by $247 million, or 2.4% year over year, primarily driven by our Global Products segment. Net revenue was unfavorably impacted by the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of $71 million, or 0.7%, primarily due to the sale of a majority interest the Companys former Electrical and Metal Products business, which contributed $347 million of net revenue during the year ended September 30, 2011, partially offset by the acquisitions of Chemguard and Visonic within the Companys Global Products segment. Unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted net revenue by $226 million, or 2.1%. In addition, because the Companys fiscal year ends on the last Friday in September, fiscal 2012 consisted of 52 weeks as compared to 53 weeks in fiscal 2011. As a result, fiscal year 2011 includes an estimated $98 million of revenue from the additional week. Fiscal 2011 Net revenue for the year ended September 30, 2011 decreased by $463 million, or 4.2%, to $10.6 billion as compared to net revenue of $11.0 billion for the year ended September 24, 2010. On an organic basis, net revenue grew by $465 million, or 4.8% year over year, primarily driven by our Global Products and NA Installation & Services segments. Net revenue was unfavorably impacted by the net 45 Table of Contents impact of acquisitions and divestitures of $1.3 billion, or 11.8%, which was primarily the result of the sale of a majority interest in the Companys former Electrical and Metal Products business, which contributed approximately $1.4 billion of net revenue during the year ended September 24, 2010 and $347 million during the year ended September 30, 2011. Net revenue was also unfavorably impacted by $72 million, or 0.7%, due to the deconsolidation of a joint venture in our ROW Installation & Services segment due to the adoption of an accounting standard. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted net revenue by $306 million, or 2.8%. In addition, because the Companys fiscal year ends on the last Friday in September, fiscal 2011 consisted of 53 weeks, as compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2010. As a result, fiscal year 2011 includes an estimated $98 million, or 0.9%, of revenue from the additional week. Operating Income: Operating income for the year ended September 28, 2012 decreased $297 million, or 30.2%, to $685 million, as compared to operating income of $982 million for the year ended September 30, 2011. Operating income for the year ended September 28, 2012 declined primarily due to the net gain on divestitures of $224 million that was recognized in the prior year, primarily related to a $248 million net gain related to the sale of a majority interest in the Companys former Electrical and Metal products business. Operating income for the year ended September 30, 2011 increased $367 million, or 59.7%, to $982 million, as compared to operating income of $615 million for the year ended September 24, 2010. Operating income for the year ended September 30, 2011 improved due to the net gain on divestitures, pricing initiatives, improvement in mix driven by project selectivity, as well as the benefit of ongoing cost containment and restructuring actions. Items impacting operating income for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 are as follows: For the Years Ended ($ in millions) September 28, 2012 September 30, 2011 September 24, 2010 Separation costs included in SG&A $ 4 $ $ Separation costs 71 Loss (gain) on divestitures 14 (224 )(1) (39 ) Restructuring and asset impairment charges 104 78 103 Acquisition and integration costs 9 5 Notes receivable write off 5 Legacy legal items (4 ) 20 Asbestos related charges 111 10 77 (1)Includes a $248 million net gain on the divestiture of a majority interest in the Electrical and Metal Products business. Interest Income and Expense Interest income was $19 million in 2012, as compared to $27 million and $25 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Interest income decreased in 2012 primarily due to decreased investment yields compared to 2011 and 2010. Interest expense was $209 million in 2012, as compared to $240 million and $279 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on total debt outstanding as of September 28, 2012, September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010 was 6.5%, 5.9% and 6.3%, respectively. These decreases in interest expense and fluctuations in the weighted average interest rate are primarily related to savings realized from the $2.6 billion debt redemptions in 2012 and from the replacement of higher coupon notes with lower coupon notes during 2011. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 46  Table of Contents Other Expense, Net Significant components of Other expense, net for 2012, 2011 and 2010 are as follows ($ in millions): 2012 2011 2010 Loss on extinguishment of debt (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) $ (453 ) $ $ (87 ) 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement (loss) gain (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) (4 ) (7 ) 8 Other 3 2 3 Total $ (454 ) $ (5 ) $ (76 ) Effective Income Tax Rate Our effective income tax rate for the year ended September 28, 2012 was not meaningful primarily as a result of separation related charges which were incurred for which no tax benefit was recognized, as well as a valuation allowance of $235 million recorded due to net operating loss carryforwards which we do not expect to realize in future periods. Additionally, our effective income tax rate for the year ended September 28, 2012 was impacted by enacted tax law changes, favorable audit resolutions in multiple jurisdictions and a non recurring item generating a tax benefit. Our effective income tax rate was 17.5% and a benefit of 6.0% during the years ended September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively. The increase in our effective income tax rate was primarily related to the tax charge recorded in conjunction with the sale of a majority interest in our Electrical and Metal Products business during the first quarter of 2011, a non recurring transaction generating a tax benefit in 2010 and a release of a deferred tax valuation allowance in 2010. The effective income tax rate was positively impacted by favorable audit resolutions in multiple jurisdictions during 2011. The rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to discrete items such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, as well as recurring factors, such as the geographic mix of income before taxes. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $1,826 million and $1,149 million as of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. Specifically, the valuation allowance includes separation related charges associated with the early extinguishment of debt which further increased a net operating loss carryforward in 2012 which we do not expect to realize in future periods. The valuation allowance was calculated and recorded when we determined that it was more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets would not be realized. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as payment is not expected within one year. 47 Table of Contents Equity (Loss) Income in Earnings of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries Equity (loss) income in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2012 and 2011 reflects our share of Atkore International Group Inc.s ("Atkore") net loss which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Equity (loss) income in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries was nil in 2010. Segment Results The following chart reflects our fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 % of net revenue by operating segment. The above chart does not include net revenue related to the Companys former Electrical and Metal Products business which was divested in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 and is included within Corporate & Other. In 2011 and 2010, this represents 3.3% and 12.8%, respectively of net revenue. The segment discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in results for each of our segments included in continuing operations.

The net gain on divestiture of $253 million during the year ended September 30, 2011 is primarily related to the divestiture of a majority interest in the Companys former Electrical and Metal Products business in fiscal 2011. Additionally, corporate expense was favorably impacted by cost containment initiatives during the year ended September 30, 2011. 52  Table of Contents  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. Depreciation and Amortization Methods for Security Monitoring Related Assets Tyco considers assets related to the acquisition of new customers in its electronic security business in three asset categories: internally generated residential subscriber systems outside of North America, internally generated commercial subscriber systems (collectively referred to as subscriber system assets) and customer accounts acquired through the ADT dealer program primarily outside of North America (referred to as dealer intangibles). Subscriber system assets include installed property, plant and equipment for which Tyco retains ownership and deferred costs directly related to the customer acquisition and system installation. Subscriber system assets and any deferred revenue resulting from the customer acquisition are accounted for over the expected life of the subscriber. In certain geographical areas where the Company has a large number of customers that behave in a similar manner over time, the Company accounts for subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue using pools, with separate pools for the components of subscriber system assets and any related deferred revenue based on the month and year of acquisition. The Company depreciates its pooled subscriber system assets and related deferred revenue using an accelerated method with lives up to 15 years. The accelerated method utilizes declining balance rates based on geographical area ranging from 135% to 360% for commercial subscriber pools and dealer intangibles and converts to a straight line methodology when the resulting depreciation charge is greater than that from the accelerated method. The Company uses a straight line method with a 14 year life for non pooled subscriber system assets (primarily in Europe, Latin America and Asia) and related deferred revenue, with remaining balances written off upon customer termination. Revenue Recognition Contract sales for the installation of fire protection systems, large security intruder systems and other construction related projects are recorded primarily under the percentage of completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related total cost of the project at completion. The risk of this methodology is its dependence upon estimates of costs at completion, which are subject to the uncertainties inherent in long term contracts. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they become determinable. Sales of security monitoring systems may have multiple elements, including equipment, installation, monitoring services and maintenance agreements. We assess our revenue arrangements to determine the appropriate units of accounting. When ownership of the system is transferred to the customer, each deliverable provided under the arrangement is considered a separate unit of accounting. Revenues associated with sale of equipment and related installations are recognized once delivery, installation and customer acceptance is completed, while the revenue for monitoring and maintenance services are recognized as services are rendered. Amounts assigned to each unit of accounting are based on an allocation of total arrangement consideration using a hierarchy of estimated selling price for the deliverables. The selling price used for each deliverable will be based on Vendor Specific Objective Evidence ("VSOE") if available, Third Party Evidence ("TPE") if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price if neither VSOE or TPE is available. Revenue recognized for equipment and installation is limited to the lesser of their allocated amounts under the estimated selling price hierarchy or the non contingent up front consideration received at the time of installation, since collection of future amounts under the arrangement with the customer is contingent upon the delivery of monitoring and maintenance services. 53 Table of Contents Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience and trend analysis. Loss Contingencies Accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings, self insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on judgment, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates. Additionally, the Company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. Asbestos Related Contingencies and Insurance Receivables We and certain of our subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestos containing materials. We estimate the liability and corresponding insurance recovery for pending and future claims and defense costs based on the Companys historical claim experience, and estimates of the number and resolution cost of potential future claims that may be filed. The Companys legal strategy for resolving claims also impacts these estimates. The Company considers various trends and developments in evaluating the period of time (the look back period) over which historical claim and settlement experience is used to estimate and value claims reasonably projected to be made in the future during a defined period of time (the look forward period). As part of the Companys annual valuation process in the third quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company utilized a look back period of three years and a look forward period of fifteen years, except for claims made against a non operating subsidiary that the Company is pursuing alternatives for, including a negotiated settlement with representatives of all current and future asbestos claimants against such subsidiary. In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are probable. The estimate of asbestos related insurance recoveries represents estimated amounts due to us for previously paid and settled claims and the probable reimbursements relating to estimated liability for pending and future claims. In determining the amount of insurance recoverable, we consider available insurance, allocation methodologies, solvency and creditworthiness of the insurers. Annually, we perform an analysis with the assistance of outside counsel and other experts to update estimated asbestos related assets and liabilities. On a quarterly basis, we re evaluate the assumptions used to perform the annual analysis and record an expense as necessary to reflect changes in the estimated liability and related insurance asset. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of managements judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of asbestos related assets and liabilities. Income Taxes In determining taxable income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future pre tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We currently have recorded valuation allowances that we will maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense recorded in the future may be 54 Table of Contents reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction. Any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance could result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management records the effect of a tax rate or law change on the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period of enactment. Future tax rate or law changes could have a material effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Asset Impairments Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually and more frequently if triggering events occur. In performing these assessments, management relies on and considers a number of factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable market transactions (to the extent available), other market data and the Companys overall market capitalization. We elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for all goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. In the first step of the goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. Fair value for the goodwill impairment test is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on forecast cash flows (including estimated underlying revenue and operating income growth rates) discounted using an estimated weighted average cost of capital for market participants. A market approach, utilizing observable market data such as comparable companies in similar lines of business that are publicly traded or which are part of a public or private transaction (to the extent available), is used to corroborate the discounted cash flow analysis performed at each reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered potentially impaired and further tests are performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. In the second step of the goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill. 55 Table of Contents We recorded no goodwill impairments in conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment assessment performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of the aforementioned reporting units may include such items as follows: A prolonged downturn in the business environment in which the reporting units operate (i.e. sales volumes and prices) especially in the commercial construction and retailer end markets; An economic recovery that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing or degree; Volatility in equity and debt markets resulting in higher discount rates; and Unexpected regulatory changes. While historical performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values of goodwill in excess of carrying values, if our assumptions are not realized, it is possible that in the future an impairment charge may need to be recorded. However, it is not possible at this time to determine if an impairment charge would result or if such a charge would be material. Long Lived Assets Asset groups held and used by the Company, including property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be fully recoverable. Tyco performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if impairment exists. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, Tyco groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identified. If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Impairments to long lived assets to be disposed of are recorded based upon the fair value less cost to sell of the applicable assets. The calculation of the fair value of long lived assets is based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of long lived assets, there is a risk that the carrying value of our long lived assets may be overstated or understated. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations. Two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions resulting in actuarial gains and losses. For active plans, such actuarial gains and losses will be amortized over the average expected service period of the participants and in the case of inactive plans over the average remaining life expectancy of participants. The discount rate represents the market rate for high quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of pension obligations by approximately $77 million and increase our annual pension expense by approximately $1 million. We consider the relative weighting of plan assets by class, historical performance of asset classes over long term periods, asset class performance expectations as well as current and future economic conditions in determining the 56 Table of Contents expected long term return on plan assets. A 25 basis point decrease in the expected long term return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately $3 million.  Liquidity and Capital Resources A fundamental objective of the Company is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of its core businesses around the world. The primary source of funds to finance our operations and capital expenditures is cash generated by operations. In addition, we maintain a commercial paper program, have access to a committed revolving credit facility and have access to equity and debt capital from public and private sources. We continue to balance our operating, investing and financing uses of cash through investments and acquisitions in our core businesses, dividends and share repurchases. In addition, we believe our cash position, amounts available under our credit facility, commercial paper program and cash provided by operating activities will be adequate to cover our operational and business needs in the foreseeable future. As of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, our cash and cash equivalents, short and long term debt, and Tyco shareholders equity are as follows: As of ($ in millions) September 28, 2012 September 30, 2011 Cash and cash equivalents $ 844 (1) $ 1,229 Total debt $ 1,491 $ 4,106 Shareholders equity $ 4,994 $ 14,149 Total debt as a % of total capital 23.0 % 22.5 % (1)Cash and cash equivalents includes $175 million reserved for certain pre 2012 Separation related tax liabilities for which the timing of payment is uncertain. Sources and uses of cash In summary, our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing from continuing operations for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 were as follows: For the Years Ended ($ in millions) September 28, 2012 September 30, 2011 September 24, 2010 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 701 $ 661 $ 871 Net cash used in investing activities (582 ) (61 ) (343 ) Net cash used in financing activities (508 ) (938 ) (1,062 ) Cash flow from operating activities Cash flow from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for items such as restructuring activities, pension funding, income taxes and other items impact reported cash flow. The net change in working capital decreased operating cash flow by $489 million in 2012. The significant changes in working capital included a $172 million decrease in income taxes payable, an $80 million decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, a $128 million increase in accounts receivable, an $86 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a $72 million increase in inventories. The net change in working capital decreased operating cash flow by $348 million in 2011. The significant changes in working capital included a $216 million decrease in accrued and other liabilities, a $47 million increase in accounts receivable, a $42 million increase in inventories and a $33 million decrease in accounts payable. 57  Table of Contents The net change in working capital decreased operating cash flow by $239 million in 2010. The significant changes in working capital included a $268 million decrease in income taxes payable, a $127 million increase in inventories, partially offset by an $81 million increase in accounts payable and a $63 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets. During 2012, 2011 and 2010, we paid approximately $89 million, $90 million and $129 million (inclusive of $2 million relating to the French security business being classified as held for sale), respectively, in cash related to restructuring activities. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our restructuring activities. In connection with the 2012 Separation, we paid $18 million, nil and nil in separation costs during 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. During the years ended September 28, 2012, September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010 we made required contributions of $88 million, $63 million and $67 million, respectively, to our U.S. and non U.S. pension plans. We also made voluntary contributions of approximately nil, $12 million and nil to our U.S. plans during the years ended September 28, 2012, September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010. The Company anticipates that it will contribute at least the minimum required to its pension plans in 2013 of $11 million for the U.S. plans and $50 million for non U.S. plans. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, related to continuing operations were $147 million, $121 million and $127 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Net interest paid related to continuing operations were $201 million, $195 million and $234 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Cash flow from investing activities Cash flows related to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for capital expenditures and acquisitions, and proceeds derived from divestitures of businesses and assets. We made capital expenditures of $406 million, $371 million, and $351 million during 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The level of capital expenditures in fiscal year 2013 is expected to exceed the spending levels in fiscal year 2012 and is also expected to exceed depreciation expense. During 2012, we paid cash for acquisitions included in continuing operations totaling $217 million, net of cash acquired of $17 million, which primarily related to the acquisition of Visonic Ltd. within our Global Products segment. During 2011, we paid cash for acquisitions included in continuing operations totaling $353 million, net of cash acquired of $3 million, which primarily related to the acquisitions of Signature Security Group within our ROW Installation & Services segment and Chemguard within our Global Products segment. During 2010, cash paid for acquisitions included in continuing operations totaled $48 million, net of cash acquired of nil. During 2011, we received cash proceeds, net of cash divested of $709 million for divestitures. The cash proceeds primarily related to the sale of a majority interest in our Electrical and Metal Products business of $713 million. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Cash flow from financing activities Cash flows from financing activities relate primarily to proceeds received from incurring debt and issuing stock, and cash used to repay debt, repurchase stock and make dividend payments to shareholders. During the fourth quarter of 2012, in connection with the Separation, Tyco and its finance subsidiary, Tyco International Finance S.A. ("TIFSA"), redeemed various debt securities maturing from 58 Table of Contents 2013 to 2023 issued by TIFSA and or Tyco, in an aggregate principal amount of $2.6 billion. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. On April 25, 2012, the Company amended its existing Five Year Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement, dated April 25, 2007 ("the 2007 Credit Agreement"), to extend the expiration date of the facility from April 25, 2012 to September 30, 2012. Simultaneous with the extension, total commitments under the 2007 Credit Agreement facility were reduced from an aggregate of $750 million to $654 million. On June 22, 2012, the Company further amended the 2007 Credit Agreement to reduce the lenders commitments under the 2007 Credit Agreement from an aggregate of $654 million to $500 million. The 2007 Credit Agreement terminated on September 28, 2012. Additionally, on June 22, 2012, TIFSA, as the Borrower, and the Company as the Guarantor, entered into a Five Year Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement, expiring June 22, 2017, and providing for revolving credit commitments in the aggregate amount of $1.0 billion (the "2012 Credit Agreement"). In connection with entering into the 2012 Credit Agreement, TIFSA and the Company terminated the existing Four Year Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement, dated March 24, 2011, which provided for revolving credit commitments in the aggregate amount of $750 million. During 2012, TIFSA issued commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes. As of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, TIFSA had no commercial paper outstanding. The maximum aggregate amount of unsecured commercial paper notes available to be issued, on a private placement basis, under the commercial paper program is $1 billion as of September 28, 2012. On January 12, 2011, TIFSA, our finance subsidiary, issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% notes due on January 15, 2018 and $250 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% notes due on January 15, 2023, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. TIFSA received net cash proceeds of approximately $494 million. The net proceeds, along with other available funds, were used to fund the repayment of all of our outstanding 6.75% notes due in February 2011 with a principal amount of $516 million. On May 5, 2010, TIFSA issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375% notes due 2015, which were fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. TIFSA received net proceeds of approximately $495 million after deducting debt issuance costs and a debt discount. On May 28, 2010, the Company used the net proceeds of the aforementioned offering and additional cash on hand to redeem all of its 6.375% public notes due 2011, 7% notes due 2028 and 6.875% notes due 2029, outstanding at that time, which aggregated $878 million in principal amount. On October 5, 2009, TIFSA issued $500 million aggregate principle amount of 4.125% notes due 2014, which were fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. TIFSA received net proceeds of approximately $495 million after deducting debt issuance costs and a debt discount. Pursuant to our share repurchase program, we may repurchase Tyco shares from time to time in open market purchases at prevailing market prices, in negotiated transactions off the market, or pursuant to an approved 10b5 1 trading plan in accordance with applicable regulations. During the year ended September 28, 2012, we repurchased approximately 11 million common shares for approximately $500 million under the 2011 share repurchase program. As of September 28, 2012, approximately $200 million of share repurchases remain authorized under the 2011 share repurchase program. During the year ended September 30, 2011, we repurchased approximately 30 million common shares for approximately $1.3 billion under the 2011, 2010 and 2008 share repurchase programs, which completed both the 2010 and 2008 programs. During the year ended September 24, 2010, we repurchased approximately 24 million common shares for approximately $900 million under the 2008 share repurchase program. 59 Table of Contents On March 7, 2012, our shareholders approved a cash dividend of $0.50 per common share payable to shareholders in two quarterly installments of $0.25 each on May 23, 2012 and August 22, 2012. Additionally, on September 17, 2012, our shareholders approved another cash dividend of $0.30 per common share payable to shareholders in two quarterly installments of $0.15 per share to be paid November 15, 2012 and February 20, 2013. The $0.30 dividend reflects the impact of the 2012 Separation on the Companys dividend policy. During fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, we paid cash dividends of approximately $461 million, $458 million and $416 million, respectively. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Management believes that cash generated by or available to us should be sufficient to fund our capital and operational business needs for the foreseeable future, including capital expenditures, quarterly dividend payments and share repurchases.  Commitments and Contingencies For a detailed discussion of contingencies related to tax and litigation matters and governmental investigations, see Notes 7 and 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations and commitments for debt, minimum lease payment obligations under non cancelable operating leases and purchase obligations as of September 28, 2012 are as follows ($ in millions): Fiscal Year 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Thereafter Total Debt principal(1) $ $ $ $ 258 $ $ 1,178 $ 1,436 Interest payments(2) 93 93 93 88 84 212 663 Operating leases 162 121 102 80 47 79 591 Purchase obligations(3) 241 9 3 253 Total contractual cash obligations(4) $ 496 $ 223 $ 198 $ 426 $ 131 $ 1,469 $ 2,943 (1)Excludes debt discount, swap activity and interest. (2)Interest payments consist of interest on our fixed interest rate debt and exclude the impact of our interest rate swaps. As of September 28, 2012 we had settled all outstanding interest rate swaps. (3)Purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of goods and services. (4)Other long term liabilities excluded from the above contractual obligation table primarily consist of the following: pension and postretirement costs, income taxes, warranties and environmental liabilities. We are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items due to the inherent uncertainties related to these obligations. However, the minimum required contributions to our pension plans are expected to be approximately $61 million in 2013 and we do not expect to make any material contributions in 2013 related to postretirement benefit plans. As of September 28, 2012, we recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $121 million and gross interest and penalties of $38 million. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing for the remaining payments in future years; therefore, such amounts have been excluded from the above contractual obligation table. However, based on the current status of our income tax audits, we believe that is reasonably possible that between nil and $30 million in unrecognized tax benefits may be resolved in the next twelve months. 60 Table of Contents As of September 28, 2012, we had total commitments of $1.0 billion under our revolving credit facility, expiring on June 22, 2017. As of September 28, 2012, there were no amounts drawn under this revolving credit facility. TIFSAs revolving credit facility contains customary terms and conditions, and financial covenants that limit the ratio of our debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and that limit our ability to incur subsidiary debt or grant liens on our property. Our indentures contain customary covenants including limits on negative pledges, subsidiary debt and sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are considered restrictive to our business. In the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In connection with the 2012 Separation we entered into a liability sharing agreement regarding certain actions that were pending against Tyco prior to the 2012 Separation. Under the 2012 Tax Sharing Agreement, Pentair, Tyco and ADT share (i) certain pre Distribution income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to Tyco Flow Controls, Tycos and ADTs U.S. income tax returns, and (ii) payments required to be made by Tyco with respect to the 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement, excluding approximately $175 million of pre 2012 Separation related tax liabilities that were anticipated to be paid prior to the 2012 Separation (collectively, "Shared Tax Liabilities"). The Company will be responsible for the first $500 million of Shared Tax Liabilities. Pentair and ADT will share 42% and 58%, respectively, of the next $225 million of Shared Tax Liabilities. Pentair, ADT and Tyco will share 20%, 27.5% and 52.5%, respectively, of Shared Tax Liabilities above $725 million. In connection with the 2007 Separation, we entered into a liability sharing agreement regarding certain actions that were pending against Tyco prior to the 2007 Separation. Under the 2007 Separation and Distribution Agreement and 2007 Tax Sharing Agreement, we have assumed 27%, Covidien has assumed 42% and TE Connectivity has assumed 31% of certain Tyco pre Separation contingent and other corporate liabilities, which, as of September 28, 2012, primarily relate to tax contingencies and potential actions with respect to the spin offs or the distributions made or brought by any third party. Backlog We had a backlog of unfilled orders of $5,101 million and $4,711 million as of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, respectively. Backlog by segment was as follows ($ in millions): September 28, 2012 September 30, 2011 NA Installation & Services $ 2,507 $ 2,373 ROW Installation & Services 2,421 2,210 (1) Global Products 173 128 $ 5,101 $ 4,711 (1)As a result of the adjustments made for the China security contracts described in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, ROW Installation & Services backlog decreased by approximately $103 million as of the year ended September 30, 2011. The Companys backlog includes recurring revenue in force and long term deferred revenue for upfront fees. Revenue in force represents 12 months revenue associated with monitoring and maintenance services under contract in the security and fire business. The Companys backlog of $5,101 million and $4,711 million as of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, respectively, consists primarily of $2,723 million and $2,563 million of recurring revenue in force and $395 million 61 Table of Contents and $420 million of deferred revenue as of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, respectively. NA Installation & Services backlog of $2,507 million and $2,373 million, as of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, respectively, consists primarily of $1,227 million and $1,193 million of recurring revenue in force and $325 million and $348 million of deferred revenue as of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, respectively. ROW Installation & Services backlog of $2,421 million and $2,210 million, as of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, respectively, consists primarily of $1,496 million and $1,370 million of recurring revenue in force and $70 million and $72 million of deferred revenue as of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, respectively. Backlog increased $390 million, or 8.3%, to $5,101 million as of September 28, 2012 as compared to the prior year. The net increase in backlog was primarily related to an increase in recurring revenue in force in our ROW Installation & Services segment, as well as acquisitions within the Global Products businesses. Changes in foreign currency favorably impacted backlog by $41 million, or 0.9%. Guarantees Certain of our business segments have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from the current fiscal year through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would typically be triggered in the event of nonperformance and performance under the guarantees, if required, would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. There are certain guarantees or indemnifications extended among Tyco, Covidien, TE Connectivity, ADT and Pentair in accordance with the terms of the 2007 and 2012 Separation and Distribution Agreements and the Tax Sharing Agreements. The guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the Tax Sharing Agreement. At the time of the 2007 and 2012 Separations, we recorded liabilities necessary to recognize the fair value of such guarantees and indemnifications. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Tax Sharing Agreement. In addition, prior to the 2007 and 2012 Separations we provided support in the form of financial and or performance guarantees to various Covidien, TE Connectivity, ADT and Tyco Flow Control operating entities. To the extent these guarantees were not assigned in connection with the 2007 and 2012 Separations, we assumed primary liability on any remaining such support. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these liabilities. In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these liabilities. In the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. We record estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As of September 28, 2012, we had total outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees of approximately $425 million. For a detailed discussion of guarantees and indemnifications, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 62 Table of Contents  Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements.  Non U.S. GAAP Measure In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by U.S. GAAP, we also disclose the non U.S. GAAP measures of organic revenue growth (decline). We believe that this measure is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented. When read in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP revenue, it enables investors to better evaluate our operations without giving effect to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, which may be significant from period to period. In addition, organic revenue growth (decline) is a factor we use in internal evaluations of the overall performance of our business. This measure is not a financial measure under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for revenue as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Organic revenue growth (decline) presented herein is defined as revenue growth (decline) excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures and other changes that may not reflect underlying results and trends (for example, the 53rd week of operations in fiscal year 2011). Our organic growth (decline) calculations incorporate an estimate of prior year reported net revenue associated with acquired entities that have been fully integrated within the first year, and exclude prior year net revenue associated with entities that do not meet the criteria for discontinued operations which have been divested within the past year ("adjusted number"). We calculate the rate of organic growth (decline) based on the adjusted number to better reflect the rate of growth (decline) of the combined business, in the case of acquisitions, or the remaining business, in the case of dispositions. We base the rate of organic growth (decline) for acquired businesses that are not fully integrated within the first year upon unadjusted historical net revenue. We may use organic revenue growth (decline) as a component of our compensation programs. The table below details the components of organic revenue growth (decline) and reconciles the non U.S. GAAP measure to U.S. GAAP net revenue growth (decline).

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of conducting business, we are exposed to certain risks associated with potential changes in market conditions. These risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Accordingly, we have established a comprehensive risk management process to monitor, evaluate and manage the principal exposures to which we believe we are subject. We seek to manage these risks through the use of financial derivative instruments. Our portfolio of derivative financial instruments may, from time to time, include forward foreign currency exchange contracts, foreign currency options, interest rate swaps, commodity swaps and forward commodity contracts. Derivative financial instruments related to interest rate sensitivity of debt obligations, intercompany cross border transactions and anticipated non functional currency cash flows are used with the goal of mitigating a significant portion of these exposures when it is cost effective to do so. We do not execute transactions or utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, to reduce the risk that a counterparty will be unable to honor its contractual obligations to us, we only enter into contracts with counterparties having strong investment grade long term credit ratings from Standard & Poors and Moodys. These counterparties are generally financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one party. Foreign Currency Exposures We hedge our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates related to operating entities through the use of forward foreign currency exchange contracts. Additionally, for our corporate financing entities we manage the foreign currency exposure through a combination of multi currency notional pool and forward contracts. Our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the British pound, Euro, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar. The market risk related to the forward foreign currency exchange contract is measured by estimating the potential impact of a 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates. The rates used to perform this analysis were based on the market rates in effect on September 28, 2012. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in a $7 million net decrease in the fair value of the contracts. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates would result in a $9 million net increase in the fair value of the contracts. However, gains or losses on these derivative instruments are economically offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. Prior to the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we hedged net investments in certain foreign operations through the use of foreign currency exchange forward contracts. The objective was to minimize the exposure to changes in the value of the foreign currency denominated net investment. As of the quarter ended December 30, 2011, we terminated our net investment hedge. Accordingly, the aggregate notional amount of these hedges was nil and approximately $224 million as of September 28, 2012, and September 30, 2011, respectively. As of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, $2.0 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, of intercompany loans have been designated as permanent in nature. For the fiscal years ended September 28, 2012, September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, we recorded $48 million of cumulative transaction gain and $2 million and $34 million of cumulative translation losses, respectively, through accumulated other comprehensive loss related to these loans. Interest Rate Exposures We manage interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swap transactions with financial institutions acting as principal counterparties, which are designated as fair value hedges for accounting 66 Table of Contents purposes. Since the third quarter of 2009, TIFSA has been entering into interest rate swap transactions with the objective of managing the exposure to interest rate risk by converting interest rates of fixed rate debt to variable rates. In these contracts, TIFSA agrees with financial institutions acting as principal counterparties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated on an agreed upon notional principal amount. In connection with the debt tenders and redemption during the quarter ended September 28, 2012, TIFSA settled all outstanding interest rate swaps. Accordingly, as of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, the total gross notional amount of our interest rate swap contracts was nil and $1.2 billion, respectively.
