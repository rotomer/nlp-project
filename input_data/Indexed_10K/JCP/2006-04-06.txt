Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion, which presents the results of J. C. Penney Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company or JCPenney), should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto beginning on page F 3, along with the unaudited Five Year Financial and Operations Summaries on pages 10 and 11. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to earnings per share (EPS) are on a diluted basis and all references to years relate to fiscal years rather than to calendar years. Corporate Governance and Financial Reporting The Company remains committed to both maintaining the highest standard of corporate governance and continuously improving the transparency of its financial reporting, by providing stockholders with informative financial disclosures and presenting an accurate view of the Companys financial position and operating results. While the Company has always focused on excellence in corporate governance, management has continued to strengthen its well established programs and policies. Management also continues to employ a reporting matrix that requires written certifications on a quarterly basis from a cross discipline team of approximately 20 key members of management who have responsibility for verifying and reporting corporate results. For this Annual Report on Form 10 K, the Company made further enhancements to its financial reporting with expanded disclosures in several areas, such as including a comparative breakdown of capital expenditures, obligations related to future interest payments on long term debt and accounting policies for gift card revenue recognition, cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses. Based on the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes Oxley Act), the Company was required again in 2005 to report on the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting. In relation to these requirements, the Companys external auditors again expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment of, and the effective operation of, the Companys internal controls over financial reporting. Executive Overview 2005 marks the completion of the first year of the Companys 2005 2009 Long Range Plan and confirms solid progress toward achieving the Companys stated performance goals. The plan builds on the Companys accomplishments over the past five years and includes strategies, initiatives and execution points focused on the vision of making JCPenney the preferred shopping choice for Middle America and transitioning to a leadership position in financial performance within the retail sector. The four key strategies consist of: 1) making an emotional connection with the JCPenney customer; 2) making JCPenney an easy and exciting place to shop; 3) making JCPenney a great place to work; and 4) making JCPenney a leader in performance and execution. 12 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 2005 Accomplishments Fifth Consecutive Year of Comparable Department Store Sales Growth Comparable department store sales increased 2.9% in 2005, on top of a 4.9% increase in 2004, representing the fifth consecutive year of improvement. The Company experienced productivity improvements in its store portfolio with sales per gross square foot increasing 4.0% to $157 from $151 in 2004. Direct (catalog/Internet) sales increased 3.6% in 2005, the third year in a row of sales gains. Direct represented approximately 15% of total net retail sales in each of 2005, 2004 and 2003. Internet, the Companys fastest growing sales channel, increased nearly 28% in 2005. Internet sales now represent approximately 37% of total Direct sales and, in 2005, surpassed $1 billion in annual sales. Strong Operating Performance For 2005, operating profit increased 130 basis points to 8.4% of sales. Strong sales growth, continued improvements in gross margin and expense leverage contributed to this significant accomplishment. Operating Profit ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Gross margin $ 7,376 $ 6,989 $ 6,498 SG&A expenses 5,799 5,702 5,729 Operating profit(1) $ 1,577 $ 1,287 $ 769 As a percent of sales 8.4% 7.1% 4.4% (1) Operating profit (gross margin less SG&A expenses), which is a non GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) measure, is the key measurement on which management evaluates the financial performance of the retail operations. Operating profit excludes Net Interest Expense, Bond Premiums and Unamortized Costs and Real Estate and Other. Real estate activities, gains and losses on the sale of real estate properties, asset impairments, other charges associated with closing store and catalog facilities and other corporate charges, such as senior management transition costs in 2004, are evaluated separately from operations and are recorded in Real Estate and Other in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Income from continuing operations for 2005 increased approximately 49% to $977 million compared to $657 million in 2004. Diluted EPS from continuing operations of $3.83 for 2005 improved 74% compared to $2.20 in 2004. The 2005 results included a one time credit to income of $49 million, or $0.20 per share, which was principally attributable to eliminating the remaining state tax net operating loss valuation allowances as a result of the increased likelihood of the Companys ability to utilize the related net operating loss tax assets. Operating performance has improved year over year for each of the past five years, with operating profit increasing 710 basis points since 2000 and diluted EPS from continuing operations increasing to $3.83 for 2005 from $(0.78) in 2000. 13 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Operating Results from Continuing Operations ($ in millions, except EPS) 2005 2004 2003 Retail sales, net $ 18,781 $ 18,096 $ 17,513 Gross margin 7,376 6,989 6,498 SG&A expenses 5,799 5,702 5,729 Net interest expense 169 223 247 Bond premiums and unamortized costs 18 47 Real estate and other (income)/expense (54 ) 12 (17 ) Income from continuing operationsbefore income taxes 1,444 1,005 539 Income tax expense 467 348 179 Income from continuing operations $ 977 $ 657 $ 360 Diluted EPS from continuingoperations $ 3.83 $ 2.20 $ 1.20 Comparable department store sales(1)increase 2.9% 4.9% 0.8% Direct (catalog/Internet) sales increase 3.6% 3.3% (2) 1.5% (2) (1) Comparable department store sales are presented on a 52 week basis. Comparable department store sales include sales of stores after having been open for 12 full consecutive fiscal months. For 2005, the five stores that were closed for an extended period from the effects of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita are not included in the comparable department store sales calculation. Those stores represented approximately 0.5% of the Companys total 2004 sales. As of January 28, 2006, all but one of these stores had reopened. New and relocated stores, and the reopened stores impacted by the hurricanes, become comparable on the first day of the 13th full fiscal month of operation. (2) Excludes the effect of the 53rd week in 2003. Including sales of $46 million for the 53rd week in 2003, total Direct sales increased 1.5% and 3.3% for 2004 and 2003, respectively. Sixth Consecutive Year of Positive Free Cash Flow The Company generated $702 million of positive free cash flow from continuing operations in 2005, representing the sixth consecutive year of positive free cash flow. This improvement was principally the result of strong operating performance and the fact that no qualified pension plan contribution was made during 2005 due to the plans well funded status and Internal Revenue Service limitations on tax deductible contributions. 14 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The Companys calculation of free cash flow, which is defined on page 30, may differ from that used by other companies and therefore, comparability may be limited. The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities, a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) measure, to free cash flow from continuing operations (a non GAAP measure): Free Cash Flow from Continuing Operations ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Net cash provided by operatingactivities (GAAP)(1) $ 1,337 $ 1,111 $ 795 Less: Capital expenditures (535 ) (398 ) (359 ) Dividends paid (131 ) (150 ) (160 ) Plus: Proceeds from sale of assets 31 34 100 Free cash flow from continuingoperations (non GAAP measure) $ 702 $ 597 $ 376 (1) Includes $300 million ($190 million after tax) discretionary cash contributions to the Companys qualified pension plan in both 2004 and 2003. Improved Capital Structure and Credit Profile During 2005, the Company completed its 2005 and 2004 capital structure repositioning programs, which were initiated on July 31, 2004 in conjunction with the sale of Eckerd. The programs included an aggregate $4.15 billion of common stock repurchases and an aggregate $2.14 billion of debt reductions. To fund these programs, the Company used the $3.5 billion in net cash proceeds from the sale of the Eckerd drugstore operations, $260 million in net cash proceeds from the sale of Lojas Renner S.A. (Renner) shares, cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and existing cash and short term investment balances, including free cash flow generated in 2004. Based on these improvements in the capital structure and in the Companys related liquidity and coverage metrics, as well as the Companys improved operating performance and generation of free cash flow, several positive credit rating actions occurred in 2005. Fitch Ratings raised its credit rating on the Companys senior unsecured notes and debentures and its $1.2 billion revolving credit facility from BB+ to BBB , an investment grade credit rating. Moodys Investors Service, Inc. raised its senior unsecured credit rating for the Company from Ba2 to Ba1. Standard & Poors raised its outlook on the Company from Stable to Positive. Additional upgrades to the Companys credit ratings occurred in early 2006, which are addressed below under Current Developments. Closed on the Sale of Renner Shares On July 5, 2005, the Companys indirect wholly owned subsidiary, J. C. Penney Brazil, Inc., completed the sale of its shares in Renner, a Brazilian department store chain, through a public stock offering registered in Brazil, for net cash proceeds of approximately $260 million. Including a favorable fourth quarter adjustment of $1 million related to taxes, the sale resulted in a gain of $26 million pre tax, and a loss of $7 million on an after tax basis. Delivered Value to Stockholders In 2005, the Company provided a total return to its stockholders of 36%, on top of a 61% total stockholder return in 2004. Total stockholder return includes stock price appreciation and reinvestment 15 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements of dividends paid to stockholders. The stock price closed at $56.21 at the end of 2005, compared to $41.69 at the end of 2004. Between 2000, when the stock price closed at $12.81, and 2005, the Company has provided a total return to its stockholders of 383%. Current Developments New Common Stock Repurchase Program and Plan to Increase Dividend In February 2006, the JCPenney Board of Directors (Board) authorized a new program of common stock repurchases of up to $750 million, which will be funded with 2005 free cash flow and cash proceeds from stock option exercises. The program is expected to be completed by the end of 2006. In addition, the Board authorized a plan to increase the annual dividend from $0.50 per share to $0.72 per share, a 44% increase, beginning with the May 1 quarterly dividend. On March 21, 2006, the Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.18 per share to be paid on May 1, 2006. Credit Rating Action On February 16, 2006, Moodys Investors Service, Inc. raised its credit rating on the Companys senior unsecured notes and debentures and its $1.2 billion revolving credit facility from Ba1 to Baa3, an investment grade rating, citing the Companys continued strong liquidity, healthy free cash flow generation and solid leverage and coverage metrics. In addition, Moodys raised its corporate family debt rating from Ba1 to Baa3, revised its outlook for the Company to Stable and withdrew its speculative grade liquidity rating of SGL 1. On February 17, 2006, Standard & Poors placed the Company on a credit watch with positive rating implications. Virtual Store and Exclusive Retail Sponsorship of the Academy Awards In March 2006, the Company launched the largest branding event in its history by sponsoring the JCPenney Experience store, a showcase for its private and exclusive brands, at One Times Square in New York City. During its three week run, visitors from around the world found an exclusive assortment from the spring collections of the Companys private and exclusive brands such as: The Original Arizona Jean Company&reg;; Worthington&reg;; Stafford&reg;; nicole by Nicole Miller&reg;; Bisou Bisou&reg; by Michele Bohbot; Solitude&reg; by Shaun Tomson; Chris Madden for JCPenney Home Collection&reg; and others. Shoppers were able to make purchases in the store through interactive kiosks, which featured the full range of merchandise, more than 250,000 skus, available on www.jcp.com. The opening of this virtual store coincided with the Companys fifth annual exclusive retail sponsorship of the Academy Awards. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations added $0.43 per share to net income in 2005, principally related to favorable resolution of certain tax matters associated with the Companys former Eckerd Drugstore operations. For 2004 and 2003, discontinued operations resulted in charges of $0.44 per share and $4.33 per share, respectively. The 2004 charge resulted primarily from the loss on the sale of Eckerd combined with Eckerd operating losses to the date of sale, while the 2003 charge was primarily to reflect Eckerd at its estimated fair value less costs to sell. Lojas Renner S.A. As previously reported, on July 5, 2005, the Companys indirect wholly owned subsidiary, J. C. Penney Brazil, Inc., closed on the sale of its shares of Renner through a public stock offering registered in Brazil. The Company generated cash proceeds of $283 million from the sale of its interest in Renner. After taxes and transaction costs, net proceeds approximated $260 million. Proceeds from the sale were used for common stock repurchases, which are more fully discussed under Capital Structure Repositioning on pages 35 36. 16 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Including a favorable fourth quarter adjustment of $1 million related to taxes, the sale resulted in a pre tax gain of $26 million and a loss of $7 million on an after tax basis. The relatively high tax cost is largely due to the tax basis of the Companys investment in Renner being lower than its book basis as a result of accounting for the investment under the cost method for tax purposes. Included in the pre tax gain on the sale was $83 million of foreign currency translation losses that had accumulated since the Company acquired its controlling interest in Renner. Eckerd Drugstores On July 31, 2004, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries closed on the sale of its Eckerd drugstore operations to the Jean Coutu Group (PJC) Inc. (Coutu) and CVS Corporation and CVS Pharmacy, Inc. (together, CVS) and received net cash proceeds of approximately $3.5 billion. Proceeds from the sale were used for common stock repurchases and debt reduction, which are more fully discussed under Capital Structure Repositioning on pages 35 36. During 2005, the Company recorded an after tax credit of $103 million related to the Eckerd discontinued operations, which was primarily related to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters, as well as a reduction of the taxes payable on the sale of Eckerd due to adjustments in Eckerds tax basis. Through 2005, the cumulative loss on the sale was $714 million pre tax, or $1,330 million on an after tax basis. Of the total after tax loss on the sale, $108 million was recorded in 2004 to reflect revised estimates of certain post closing adjustments and resulting sales proceeds, and $1,325 million was recorded in 2003 to reflect Eckerd at its estimated fair value less costs to sell. The relatively high tax cost is a result of the tax basis of Eckerd being lower than its book basis because the Companys previous drugstore acquisitions were largely tax free transactions. Upon closing on the sale of Eckerd on July 31, 2004, the Company established reserves for estimated transaction costs and post closing adjustments. Certain of these reserves involved significant judgment and actual costs incurred over time could vary from these estimates. The more significant remaining estimates relate to the costs to exit the Colorado and New Mexico markets, assumption of the Eckerd Pension Plan and various post employment benefit obligations and environmental indemnifications. During the second quarter of 2005, the Company reached final settlement with both Coutu and CVS regarding the working capital adjustments as required in the respective sale agreements. The reserves that had been previously established were adequate to cover the respective payments under the settlements. Management continues to review and update the remaining reserves on a quarterly basis and believes that the overall reserves, as adjusted, are adequate at the end of 2005 and consistent with original estimates. Cash payments for the Eckerd related reserves are included in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as Cash Paid for Discontinued Operations, with tax payments included in operating cash flows and all other payments included in investing cash flows. Mexico Department Stores In November 2003, the Company closed on the sale of its six Mexico department stores and recorded a loss of $14 million, net of a $27 million tax benefit. In 2005 and 2004, the Company recognized after tax gains of $5 million and $4 million, respectively, related to reserve adjustments and additional tax benefits realized. The Companys financial statements, accompanying notes and other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10 K reflect these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented. 17 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis, consistent with all other financial data throughout this Annual Report on Form 10 K, focuses on the results of operations and financial condition from the Companys continuing operations. Income from Continuing Operations 2005 represented the Companys fifth consecutive year of earnings improvement. Income from continuing operations was $977 million, $657 million and $360 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Earnings increased as a result of continued strong sales growth, further gross margin improvement and leveraging of SG&A expenses, combined with lower interest expense and bond premiums and higher income reflected in Real Estate and Other. EPS from continuing operations increased 74% in 2005 to $3.83, compared to $2.20 in 2004 and $1.20 in 2003. EPS also benefited from the Companys 2005 and 2004 common stock repurchase programs, which were completed early in the fourth quarter of 2005. Retail Sales, Net ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Retail sales, net $ 18,781 $ 18,096 $ 17,513 Sales percent increase/(decrease): Total department stores 3.8% 4.7%(1) (0.7)%(1) Comparable department stores(2) 2.9% 4.9% 0.8% Direct (catalog/Internet) 3.6% 3.3%(3) 1.5%(3) (1) Excludes the effect of the 53rd week in 2003. Including sales of $152 million for the 53rd week in 2003, total department store sales increased 3.7% and 0.3% for 2004 and 2003, respectively. (2) Comparable department store sales are presented on a 52 week basis. Comparable department store sales include sales of stores after having been open for 12 full consecutive fiscal months. For 2005, the five stores that were closed for an extended period from the effects of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita are not included in the comparable department store sales calculation. Those stores represented approximately 0.5% of the Companys total 2004 sales. As of January 28, 2006, all but one of these stores had reopened. New and relocated stores, and the reopened stores impacted by the hurricanes, become comparable on the first day of the 13th full fiscal month of operation. (3) Excludes the effect of the 53rd week in 2003. Including sales of $46 million for the 53rd week in 2003, total Direct sales increased 1.5% and 3.3% for 2004 and 2003, respectively. Comparable department store sales increased for the fifth consecutive year on a portfolio of largely mature department stores. Department store sales reflect increases in all merchandise divisions in 2005, led by family footwear, womens accessories, fine jewelry and childrens apparel. While the womens apparel division experienced the smallest sales increase, results were strong in both junior and womens sportswear. From a regional perspective, all areas of the country experienced increases in 2005, with the strongest performance in the southeastern and western regions of the country, while the northeast experienced the smallest increase. Sales reflect good customer response to both fashion and basic merchandise and strong sales gains in the Companys key private brands. Department store sales have continued to benefit from positive customer response to the style, quality, selection and value offered in the Companys merchandise assortments, compelling marketing programs and continued improvement in the store shopping experience. 18 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Direct (catalog/Internet) sales, which offer customers multi channel convenience and a broader merchandise selection complementing that carried in the Companys department stores, increased 3.6% for 2005, compared to a 3.3% increase in 2004 and a 1.5% increase in 2003, all on a 52 week basis. Direct sales continue to reflect a focus on targeted specialty media and the expanded assortments and convenience of the Internet. The Direct channel represented approximately 15% of total net retail sales in each of 2005, 2004 and 2003. Consistent with customer shopping patterns, the Company continually reviews its catalog page counts and circulation to ensure that print catalogs remain productive, while planning for a gradual shift toward a higher level of shopping via the Internet. The Internet channel continues to experience strong sales growth, increasing nearly 28% in 2005 to $1,038 million, compared to $812 million in 2004 and $617 million in 2003. Internet sales represented approximately 37% of total Direct sales for 2005, compared to 30% in 2004 and 23% in 2003. As part of its 2005 2009 Long Range Plan, the Company has implemented lifestyle merchandising initiatives offering styles that inspire and reflect the lifestyles of its target customers. The Company has identified distinct categories that reflect its customers style preferences conservative, traditional, modern and trendy making JCPenney more relevant to an expanded customer base. The Company will continue to enhance its strong private, exclusive and national brands that develop customer loyalty by focusing its merchandise more closely on each of the customer lifestyles. Additional resources are being focused on each of the major brands to ensure consistency from design and lifestyle marketing to point of sale support. The brands launched in 2005 and planned for 2006 are the result of these merchandising initiatives. Private brand sales, including exclusive brands found only at JCPenney, totaled approximately 46%, 42% and 39% of total merchandise sales for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In late 2005, the Company introduced a new private brand, a.n.a, a casual weekend apparel line designed for the modern female customer. The Chris Madden for JCPenney Home Collection&reg;, originally launched in the second quarter of 2004, continues to perform well for the Company and has been expanded with new furniture, bedding and window coverings collections. In the first quarter of 2005, the Company launched two new casual dressy brands for women, nicole by Nicole Miller&reg; and W work to weekend, an extension of the Companys Worthington&reg; private brand. Management is pleased with customer response and sales results for the Companys new merchandise launches as well as the performance of the expanded Chris Madden offerings. In early 2006, the Company launched Solitude&reg; by Shaun Tomson, a California lifestyle inspired mens apparel brand, and Rule by Steve Madden in family footwear. The Company introduced the Miss Bisou&reg; clothing collection for juniors, an extension of the Bisou Bisou&reg; womens sportswear line, and Studio by the JCPenney Home Collection, a modern furniture collection. Also in 2006, the Company added the Chris Madden&reg; Hotel Collection, which features silk blend comforters and 600 thread count sheets. Gross Margin ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 First in first out (FIFO) gross margin $ 7,375 $ 6,971 $ 6,492 Last in first out (LIFO) credit 1 18 6 LIFO gross margin $ 7,376 $ 6,989 $ 6,498 As a percent of sales 39.3% 38.6% 37.1% 19 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Gross margin improved for the fifth consecutive year and was $7,376 million in 2005, compared to $6,989 million in 2004 and $6,498 million in 2003. As a percent of sales, gross margin improved 70 basis points over last year and represents a 770 basis point increase since 2000, which restores the Companys gross margin to competitive levels. The continued improvement in gross margin reflects better management of inventory flow and seasonal transition, better timing of clearance markdowns, continued strength in the performance of the Companys private brand merchandise, consistency of execution and continuing benefits from the centralized model. Benefits of the centralized model, which was substantially in place by the end of 2004, have included enhanced merchandise offerings, an integrated marketing plan, leverage in the buying and merchandising process and more efficient selection and allocation of merchandise to individual department stores. Gross margin also reflects initial benefits from the Companys new planning, allocation and replenishment systems, which were rolled out in the latter part of 2004. Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 SG&A expenses $ 5,799 $ 5,702 $ 5,729 As a percent of sales 30.9% 31.5% 32.7% SG&A expenses improved by 60 basis points in 2005 to 30.9% of sales, on top of a 120 basis point improvement in 2004. The Company experienced savings from continued improvements in productivity in the centralized store distribution centers, efficiencies from changes in the previously disclosed department store staffing model and efficiencies in the Direct channel. While expenditures for advertising were virtually flat with 2004, the Company shifted a portion of the marketing dollars spent in 2005 from promotional advertising to elevating the branding message of both JCPenney and the Companys private brands. Total SG&A expense dollars increased 1.7% in 2005 to $5,799 million, compared to $5,702 million in 2004 and $5,729 million in 2003. SG&A expenses for 2005 included $32 million, or about $0.08 per share, related to expensing employee stock options, which started in the first quarter of 2005 upon the early adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). SG&A expense increases in 2005 also included costs related to the new point of sale system rollout, costs to support new store openings and higher utility costs. In 2005, the Company recorded total contributions to its employee 401(k) savings plan of $71 million. This compares to Company contributions of $47 million and $45 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. 2005 SG&A expenses also reflected a previously announced one time credit of $13 million recorded in the third quarter related to the Companys share of expected proceeds from the Visa Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litigation settlement, which was essentially offset by hurricane related costs, net of probable insurance recoveries. SG&A expenses improved by 120 basis points in 2004. During 2004, the Company experienced savings in labor costs, centralized store expense management and a decline in non cash pension expense. SG&A reflected initial savings from the Companys cost savings initiatives that focused on supply chain efficiencies, store workload and expense management, more productive marketing events and other operating efficiencies. These initiatives delivered over $100 million of savings for 2004, or 60 basis points of improvement. 2004 SG&A expenses also included a fourth quarter pre tax charge of $8 million, or about $0.02 per share, related to lease accounting adjustments made primarily to synchronize depreciation and amortization periods with the related lease terms. SG&A expenses for 2003 included $65 million of expenses attributable to the 53rd week in 2003 and a $21 million charge for costs related to the implementation of the cost savings initiatives discussed above. 20 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Operating Profit ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Operating profit(1) $ 1,577 $ 1,287 $ 769 As a percent of sales 8.4% 7.1% 4.4% (1) See calculation of Operating Profit on page 13. Operating profit improved for the fifth straight year in 2005, increasing 23%, or 130 basis points as a percent of sales, driven by sales gains, continued improvement in gross margin and expense leverage. Operating profit (gross margin less SG&A expenses) is the key measurement on which management evaluates the financial performance of retail operations. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense totaled $169 million, $223 million and $247 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Net interest expense consists primarily of interest expense on long term debt, net of interest income earned on cash and short term investments. Net interest expense in 2005 benefited from higher short term interest rates on cash and short term investment balances, as well as the reduction in total debt. The weighted average interest rate on long term debt has remained relatively constant at 7.8%, 7.7% and 7.7% in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Interest income earned on short term investments increased significantly to an average annual interest rate of 3.2% in 2005, compared to 1.5% in 2004 and 1.1% in 2003. Total debt was reduced by $2.14 billion as part of the Companys debt reduction programs initiated in 2004 and completed by the end of the second quarter of 2005. For 2004 and 2003, net interest expense of $95 million and $159 million, respectively, was allocated to the operating results of Eckerd and recorded as discontinued operations. Bond Premiums and Unamortized Costs During 2005 and 2004, the Company incurred $18 million and $47 million, respectively, of premiums, commissions and unamortized costs related to the purchase of debt in the open market and redemption of securities under the capital structure repositioning program, which is discussed on pages 35 36. These costs are reflected in Bond Premiums and Unamortized Costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. No such costs were incurred by the Company in 2003. Real Estate and Other (Income)/Expense ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Real estate activities $ (39 ) $ (30 ) $ (28 ) Net gains from sale of real estate (27 ) (8 ) (51 ) Asset impairments, PVOL(1) and otherunit closing costs 12 19 57 Management transition costs 29 Other 2 5 Total $ (54 ) $ 12 $ (17 ) (1) Represents the present value of operating lease obligations. 21 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Real Estate Activities and Net Gains from Sale of Real Estate Real estate activities consist primarily of ongoing operating income from the Companys real estate subsidiaries. In addition, net gains were recorded from the sale of facilities and real estate that are no longer used in Company operations and investments in real estate partnerships. For 2005, approximately half of the gain from the sale of real estate was from the sale of a vacant merchandise processing facility that was made obsolete by the centralized network of store distribution centers put in place by mid 2003. Asset Impairments, PVOL and Other Unit Closing Costs In 2005, the Company recorded charges of $12 million, which consisted of $7 million of asset impairments and $5 million of expenses related to PVOL and other costs for closed units. Impairments relate primarily to department stores and are the result of the Companys ongoing process of evaluating the productivity of its asset base, as described under Valuation of Long Lived Assets on page 43. The Company recorded charges in 2004 of $19 million, which consisted of $12 million of asset impairments and $7 million of expenses related to PVOL and other costs for closed units. In 2003, the Company recorded charges of $57 million, which consisted of $26 million of asset impairments, $22 million of accelerated depreciation for closed catalog facilities and $9 million for PVOL and other unit closing costs. Management Transition Costs In 2004, the Company recorded a $29 million charge associated with the senior management transition. Income Taxes The overall effective tax rates for continuing operations were 32.3%, 34.6% and 33.2% for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 2005 rate decrease was primarily due to a fourth quarter one time credit of $49 million, or $0.20 per share on a full year basis, which was principally attributable to reversing the remaining state tax net operating loss valuation allowance. Management now believes it is more likely than not that the Company will generate sufficient income over the next several years in order to utilize the remaining state net operating loss tax assets. Also benefiting 2005 was a one time credit of $5 million related to changes in state income tax laws, which was reflected in the second quarter. The Companys improved earnings in 2005 and 2004 decreased the favorable tax rate impact of permanent adjustments, principally the deduction of dividends paid to the Companys savings plan. Additionally, the 2005 deduction for dividends paid decreased compared to 2004 due to the redemption, through conversion to common stock, of all shares of the Series B ESOP Convertible Preferred Stock that had been held by the savings plan, which occurred in the third quarter of 2004. With the elimination of the Companys remaining state tax net operating loss valuation reserve in 2005, the 2006 effective income tax rate is expected to increase to approximately 37%. Financial Condition The strength of the Companys financial condition is primarily dependent on the competitiveness of its customer value proposition and the level of operating performance relative to the capital resources invested in the business. Therefore, managements execution of the Long Range Plan will continue to be the key driver of the Companys consistent operating performance improvement, earnings per share growth, stock market valuation and overall financial condition. Financial Goals The Companys financial strategy will continue to focus on opportunities to deliver value to stockholders, strengthen the financial position and improve the credit profile. In order for the Company 22 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements to achieve its objective of becoming a leader in performance and execution, long range planning targets have been established related to operating financial goals, key financial metrics, cash flow, credit ratings, dividends and earnings per share growth, which are discussed below. Specific long range operating financial objectives include having low single digit comparable department store sales increases and low to mid single digit Direct sales increases each year, continuing to improve annual gross margin to more than 39% of sales and continuing to leverage SG&A expenses to a level that is less than 30% of sales. This results in an operating profit planning target of 9.0% to 9.5% of sales. With 2005 gross margin at 39.3% and SG&A expenses at 30.9% percent of sales, the Companys 2005 operating performance represented an acceleration of the planned performance levels in the 2005 2009 Long Range Plan. Going forward, the growth drivers for operating profit will continue to be sales productivity improvements, SG&A leverage and modest improvements in the gross margin rate. The Companys progress toward achieving its operating financial goals could be impacted by various risks, which are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, beginning on page 4 and under Risk Management beginning on page 36. Key financial metrics are utilized by investors, the rating agencies and banks to measure the competitiveness of a companys productivity of its capital resources. These measures include returns on stockholders equity and invested capital, and financial leverage metrics, including: long term debt to EBITDA, the fixed charge coverage ratio (EBITDA plus rent expense divided by rent expense plus net interest expense) and debt percent to total capital. With the Companys significant performance improvement in 2005, its key financial metrics are now in substantial alignment with retail industry leaders. The Company is targeting free cash flow to be positive each year, which should provide financial flexibility and ongoing support for the Long Range Plan. Continued strong operating performance, positive free cash flow and a strengthening capital structure should enable the Company to achieve competitive investment grade credit ratings on par with retail industry leaders. This should allow the Company to access the commercial paper market, thereby enhancing its financial flexibility. The goal of the Companys dividend policy is to deliver competitive value to stockholders consistent with retail industry leaders. The achievement of the financial goals should lead to consistent earnings per share growth at a level commensurate with retail industry leaders, reflecting the Companys customer value proposition within the overall retail sector. 2005 Key Financial Metrics The Companys 2005 performance represented significant strides in its progress toward industry leadership, resulting from continued improvement in operating results and the completion of the capital structure repositioning programs that commenced with the sale of Eckerd. Over the past three years, the Companys returns on capital have significantly improved, and its financial leverage has been dramatically reduced. The Companys operating performance in 2005 was one year ahead of the original 2005 2009 Long Range Plan. As a result, the Companys key financial metrics earnings growth, returns on capital and financial leverage are now in substantial alignment with retail industry leaders. 23 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Management utilizes these financial metrics to assess the Companys financial health and benchmark against planned targets as well as peers in the retail industry. The Companys calculations of these metrics are based on components of the GAAP financial statements and may vary from those of other companies, potentially limiting comparability. These measures are not considered GAAP measures, but management believes they provide the most comprehensive perspective of the Companys capital productivity and financial leverage. Return on Capital Metrics In 2005, the Companys return on stockholders equity (ROE) and return on invested capital (ROIC) improved significantly and are now in substantial alignment with retail industry leaders. In 2005, the Company achieved a 20.1% ROE, representing a threefold improvement since 2003. The Company uses an 11% ROIC as its target or hurdle rate for new capital investments, which represents the Companys estimated blended (debt and equity) long term cost of capital. In 2005, the Company exceeded this level with a ROIC of 13.3%. Further improvement in both ROE and ROIC is expected in future years with continued earnings growth and common stock repurchases. ROE and ROIC ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Long term debt, including current maturities, beginning of year $ 3,923 $ 5,356 $ 5,173 Stockholders equity, beginning of year 4,856 5,425 6,370 Total invested capital, beginning of year $ 8,779 $ 10,781 $ 11,543 Income from continuing operations $ 977 $ 657 $ 360 Interest expense on long term debt, net of incometax expense of $90, $129 and $142(1) 190 244 287 After tax return to investors $ 1,167 $ 901 $ 647 Return on stockholders equity (ROE)(2) 20.1% 12.1% 5.7% Return on invested capital (ROIC)(3) 13.3% 8.4% 5.6% (1) See Note 12 for interest expense on long term debt. (2) Represents income from continuing operations divided by stockholders equity, beginning of year. (3) Represents after tax return to investors (stockholders and long term debt holders) divided by total invested capital, beginning of year. Financial Leverage Metrics Stock and bond investors, the rating agencies and banks utilize financial leverage metrics as key capital productivity measures to assess a companys financial strength and its effective utilization of debt capital. The long term debt to EBITDA ratio and the fixed charge coverage ratio are included as covenants in the Companys five year $1.2 billion revolving credit facility that was put in place in April 2005 (2005 Credit Facility), which is discussed on page 33. Going forward, the Company expects that the rating agencies will continue to focus on consistent operating performance improvement, earnings growth and appropriate financial leverage ratios in making any further credit rating upgrade decisions. Ratio of Long Term Debt to Adjusted EBITDA of Continuing Operations This financial metric measures the amount of long term debt relative to the annual EBITDA generated by the Company. EBITDA is an operating cash flow measure and represents income from continuing 24 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements operations before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. The 2005 Credit Facility includes a requirement that the Company maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a maximum ratio of Funded Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA (Leverage Ratio, as defined in the 2005 Credit Facility), as measured on a trailing four quarters basis, of no more than 3.0 to 1.0. As presented in the table below, the Companys ratio of long term debt to adjusted EBITDA of continuing operations improved significantly during 2005, well within the covenant requirement of no more than 3.0 to 1.0. In 2003, the Company had approximately $4.80 of debt for each $1.00 of EBITDA generated by the business. In 2005, this leverage ratio improved to approximately $1.80 of debt per $1.00 of EBITDA and is expected to improve slightly in 2006 with continued earnings growth and no anticipated increase in long term debt. Long Term Debt to Adjusted EBITDA of Continuing Operations ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 1,444 $ 1,005 $ 539 Add back/(deduct): Net interest expense 169 223 247 Bond premiums and unamortized costs 18 47 Real estate and other (income)/expense (54 ) 12 (17 ) Depreciation and amortization 372 359 364 EBITDA of continuing operations 1,949 1,646 1,133 Debt covenant adjustments (1) 8 (28 ) (14 ) Adjusted EBITDA of continuing operations $ 1,957 $ 1,618 $ 1,119 Long term debt, including current maturities $ 3,465 $ 3,923 $ 5,356 Ratio of long term debt to adjusted EBITDA of continuing operations 1.8 to 1 2.4 to 1 4.8 to 1 (1) Adjustments required to conform EBITDA to the debt covenant requirements for the Companys 2005 Credit Facility. Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio The fixed charge coverage ratio is defined as the ratio of EBITDAR to fixed charges. EBITDAR is another operating cash flow measure and represents income from continuing operations before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and real property rent expense, while fixed charges consist of real property rent expense plus net interest expense. The 2005 Credit Facility requires that the Company maintain, for each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, a minimum ratio of Consolidated EBITDA plus Consolidated Rent Expense to Consolidated Interest Expense plus Consolidated Rent Expense (Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, as defined in the 2005 Credit Facility) of at least 3.2 to 1.0. 25 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements As presented in the table below, the Companys fixed charge coverage ratio improved significantly during 2005 and is comfortably in compliance with the requirement of at least 3.2 to 1.0. In 2003, the Company had $2.90 of EBITDAR generated by the business for every $1.00 of interest plus rent. In 2005, the coverage ratio improved to $5.50 of EBITDAR per $1.00 of interest plus rent and is expected to improve slightly in 2006 with improved earnings growth. Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Adjusted EBITDA of continuing operations $ 1,957 $ 1,618 $ 1,119 Real property rent expense 228 225 219 EBITDAR of continuing operations $ 2,185 $ 1,843 $ 1,338 Fixed charges: Real property rent expense $ 228 $ 225 $ 219 Net interest expense 169 223 247 Total fixed charges $ 397 $ 448 $ 466 Fixed charge coverage ratio 5.5 to 1 4.1 to 1 2.9 to 1 Debt Percent to Total Capital The Company manages its capital structure to ensure financial flexibility and access to capital, at a competitive cost, necessary to support the Long Range Plan. Management considers all on and off balance sheet debt in evaluating the Companys overall liquidity position and capital structure. Off balance sheet debt consists of the present value of operating leases (PVOL), which are a fundamental part of the Companys operations. The Companys capital structure in 2005 and 2004 was positively impacted by improved earnings and positive free cash flow of $702 million and $597 million, respectively, generated from continuing operations, as well as the Renner stock sale in 2005 and the sale of Eckerd in 2004. Additionally, the recently completed 2005 and 2004 capital structure repositioning programs served to strengthen the Companys financial position. The Companys debt percent to total capital improved over the 2003 to 2005 period. However, the common stock repurchases made under the capital structure repositioning programs reduced consolidated equity, which led to the 2005 increase in debt percent to total capital. Over the Long Range Plan period, the Company is planning for additional debt reductions, which will continue to improve its debt to capital ratio. 26 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Debt Percent to Total Capital ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Total debt(1) $ 3,465 $ 3,923 $ 5,356 PVOL(2) 857 761 704 Total debt, including PVOL 4,322 4,684 6,060 Consolidated equity 4,007 4,856 5,425 Total capital $ 8,329 $ 9,540 $ 11,485 Debt percent to total capital 46.4% 44.7% (3) 49.7% (3) Debt percent to total capital, including PVOL 51.9% 49.1% (3) 52.8% (3) (1) Includes all long term debt, including current maturities, capital leases and other. Due to the sale of Renner shares in 2005, short term debt of $22 million and $18 million at the end of 2004 and 2003, respectively, has been excluded since it is included in Liabilities of Discontinued Operations in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. There was no other short term debt at the end of 2005, 2004 or 2003. (2) PVOL is based on future minimum lease payments for non cancelable operating leases, including renewals determined to be reasonably assured. (3) Assuming the completion of the initial $3 billion of common stock repurchases, the debt percent to total capital would have been 50.7% and 68.8% for 2004 and 2003, respectively, and the debt percent to total capital, including PVOL, would have been 55.2% and 71.4% for 2004 and 2003, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Over the 2000 to 2005 period, the Companys liquidity and capital resources have strengthened significantly and created an increased level of financial flexibility to support the Companys Long Range Plan. Cash and Short Term Investments ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Cash and short term investments $ 3,016 $ 4,649 $ 2,964 At year end 2005, the Company had approximately $3.0 billion of cash and short term investments, which represented 87% of the $3.5 billion of outstanding long term debt, including current maturities. Cash and short term investments included restricted short term investment balances of $65 million as of January 28, 2006, which are pledged as collateral for a portion of casualty insurance program liabilities. In 2005, while cash and short term investments benefited from improved operating performance, positive free cash flow and the Renner stock sale, balances have been reduced as the Company continued the funding of its 2005 and 2004 capital structure repositioning programs, which were completed early in the fourth quarter of 2005. The increase in cash and short term investments in 2004 was primarily from the sale of Eckerd and free cash flow, offset by cash used to fund the 2004 capital structure repositioning program. The 2005 and 2004 capital structure repositioning programs are discussed in more detail on pages 35 36. In addition to cash and short term investments, the Companys liquidity position includes the 2005 Credit Facility. The 2005 Credit Facility is unsecured, and all collateral securing the previously existing $1.5 billion credit facility has been released. The dollar amount of the credit facility was reduced due to the sale of Eckerd. For further discussion on the credit facility, see page 33. The Companys liquidity is enhanced by the fact that the current debt portfolio and material lease agreements contain no provisions that could trigger acceleration of payments or collateral support in the event of adverse changes in the Companys financial condition. 27 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Cash Flows The following is a summary of the Companys cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities: ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Net cash provided by/(used in): Operating activities(1) $ 1,337 $ 1,111 $ 795 Investing activities (221 ) 4,302 (239 ) Financing activities (2,652 ) (2,660 ) 20 Cash (paid) for discontinued operations(2) (97 ) (1,068 )(3) (66 ) Net (decrease)/increase in cash and short term investments $ (1,633 ) $ 1,685 $ 510 (1) Includes $300 million ($190 million after tax) discretionary cash contributions to the Companys qualified pension plan in both 2004 and 2003. No contribution to the Companys qualified pension plan was made in 2005 due to the plans well funded status and Internal Revenue Service limitations on tax deductible contributions. (2) See the Companys Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows on page F 6 for a breakdown of cash (paid) for discontinued operations among operating, investing and financing activities. (3) Includes $822 million of income taxes paid related to the sale of Eckerd. Cash Flow from Operating Activities The Companys operations are seasonal in nature, with the business depending to a great extent on the last quarter of the year when a significant portion of the sales, profits and positive operating cash flows are realized. Cash requirements are highest in the third quarter as the Company builds inventory levels in preparation for the holiday season. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to improved operating performance and the fact that no tax deductible contribution was made to the Companys qualified pension plan during 2005, partially offset by higher income tax payments. In both 2004 and 2003, a $300 million discretionary contribution was made to the Companys qualified pension plan and reflected in cash provided by operating activities. Based on market conditions, the resulting well funded status of the plan and Internal Revenue Service rules limiting tax deductible contributions, the Company did not make a discretionary pension contribution to its qualified pension plan in 2005. Additionally, due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, $43 million of excess tax benefits from stock options exercised is reflected in cash flows from financing activities for 2005, whereas for 2004 and 2003, $76 million and $4 million, respectively, of excess tax benefits from stock options exercised were reflected in cash flows from operating activities. Cash Flow from Investing Activities Capital expenditures, including capitalized software costs, were $535 million, $398 million and $359 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Capital spending for 2005 was principally for new off mall stores, store renewals and modernizations and costs related to new point of sale technology. During 2005, the Company opened 18 new stores, 11 of which were store relocations, and closed five stores. The following provides a breakdown of capital expenditures: ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 New and relocated stores $ 173 $ 119 $ 80 Store renewals and updates 204 185 152 Technology 110 69 49 Other 48 25 78 Total $ 535 $ 398 $ 359 28 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Consistent with the Long Range Plan, new store growth is planned to accelerate beginning in 2006. Management expects 2006 capital expenditures to be approximately $800 million. Approximately 45% of the capital spending will relate to new or relocated stores, 30% for store renewals and updates, 20% for technology, including the remaining costs related to the new point of sale system rollout, and 5% on other routine projects. The Company currently plans to open 27 new and relocated stores in 2006, of which about 20 will be off mall. Incorporating relocations and store closures, net square footage growth is expected to increase approximately 1%. Cash proceeds of $283 million were received from the Renner stock sale, which closed on July 5, 2005. After deducting taxes, fees and other transaction costs, net cash proceeds approximated $260 million. For 2004, investing activities included approximately $4.7 billion in gross cash proceeds related to the sale of Eckerd and, for 2003, included $20 million in gross cash proceeds from the sale of the Companys six Mexico department stores. Proceeds from the sale of closed units were $31 million for 2005, compared to $34 million and $100 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Cash Flow from Financing Activities For 2005, cash payments for long term debt, including capital leases and bond premiums and commissions, totaled $474 million. During 2004, such payments totaled $856 million. These debt reductions are discussed further under Capital Structure Repositioning on pages 35 36. During 2003, the Company issued $600 million principal amount of unsecured 8.0% Notes Due 2010 at an effective interest rate of 8.125% and retired $450 million of long term debt, principally debt issues that matured during 2003. During 2005, the Company returned approximately $2.4 billion to stockholders through common stock repurchases and dividend payments. The Company repurchased 44.2 million shares of common stock for $2,201 million during 2005, including commissions. In addition, $51 million of cash was paid during the first quarter of 2005 for settlement of 2004 share repurchases. Common stock was retired on the same day it was repurchased, and the related cash settlements were completed on the third business day following the repurchase. During 2004, cash payments of $1,901 million were made related to share repurchases. No common stock repurchases were made during 2003. The Company paid quarterly dividends on its common stock of $0.125 per share in 2005, 2004 and 2003. The Board reviews the dividend policy and rate on a quarterly basis, and takes into consideration the overall financial and strategic outlook for the Company, earnings, liquidity and cash flow projections, as well as competitive factors. Based on the current outlook, in February 2006, the Board authorized a plan to increase the annual dividend from $0.50 per share to $0.72 per share, a 44% increase. On March 21, 2006, the Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.18 per share to be paid on May 1, 2006. Prior to August 26, 2004, the Company also paid semi annual dividends on its Series B ESOP Convertible Preferred Stock at an annual rate of $2.37 per common share equivalent. All outstanding shares of Series B ESOP Convertible Preferred Stock were converted to shares of common stock on August 26, 2004. Dividends are paid when, as, and if declared by the Board. Net proceeds from the exercise of stock options were $162 million in 2005, compared to $248 million in 2004 and $31 million in 2003. Due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R in 2005, excess tax benefits on stock option exercises of $43 million were reflected as cash inflows from financing activities. Previously, such amounts were included in cash flows from operating activities. 29 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Free Cash Flow from Continuing Operations ($ in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP)(1) $ 1,337 $ 1,111 $ 795 Less: Capital expenditures (535 ) (398 ) (359 ) Dividends paid (131 ) (150 ) (160 ) Plus: Proceeds from sale of assets 31 34 100 Free cash flow from continuing operations $ 702 $ 597 $ 376 (1) Includes $300 million ($190 million after tax) discretionary cash contributions to the Companys qualified pension plan in both 2004 and 2003. No contribution to the Companys qualified pension plan was made in 2005 due to the plans well funded status and Internal Revenue Service limitations on tax deductible contributions. In addition to cash flow from operating activities, management also evaluates free cash flow from continuing operations, an important financial measure that is widely used by investors, the rating agencies and banks. Free cash flow from continuing operations is defined as cash provided by operating activities less dividends and capital expenditures, net of proceeds from the sale of assets. The Companys calculation of free cash flow may differ from that used by other companies and therefore, comparability may be limited. While free cash flow is a non GAAP financial measure, it is derived from components of the Companys consolidated GAAP cash flow statement. Management believes free cash flow from continuing operations is important in evaluating the Companys financial performance and measuring the ability to generate cash without incurring additional external financing. Positive free cash flow generated by a company indicates the amount of cash available for reinvestment in the business, or cash that can be returned to investors through increased dividends, stock repurchase programs, debt retirements or a combination of these. Conversely, negative free cash flow indicates the amount of cash that must be raised from investors through new debt or equity issues, reduction in available cash balances or a combination of these. Based on the seasonality of the Companys business, cumulative free cash flow is generally negative the first three quarters of the year and becomes positive in the fourth quarter. The Company generated $702 million of free cash flow in 2005, which represented the sixth consecutive year of positive free cash flow. This improvement was principally the result of strong operating performance and the fact that no pension plan contribution was made during 2005 as discussed previously, partially offset by higher Company income tax payments and an increase in capital expenditures. Cash Flow and Financing Outlook In 2006, the Companys financing strategy will continue to focus on opportunities to deliver value to stockholders, strengthen the Companys financial position and improve its credit profile. The Companys strengthened financial position provides an increased level of financial flexibility to support the strategic growth objectives of the Long Range Plan. Consistent with the Companys goal of delivering value to stockholders, in February 2006, the Board approved a plan to increase the annual dividend from $0.50 to $0.72 per share, a 44% increase. On March 21, 2006, the Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.18 per share to be paid on May 1, 2006. Also, in February 2006, the Board 30 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements authorized a new $750 million common stock repurchase program, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2006, that will be funded by 2005 free cash flow, as well as a portion of the cash proceeds and tax benefits from associate stock option exercises. Free cash flow in 2006 is expected to be approximately $200 million, which reflects working capital needs, the planned increase in capital expenditures in order to accelerate the pace of new, principally off mall store openings, a $300 million discretionary pension contribution and the planned increase in dividends. The reduction in free cash flow from 2005 to 2006 will result primarily from increased capital expenditure levels and a planned pension contribution. In accordance with its financing strategy, the Company expects to maintain its strong liquidity position in 2006. Until all of the Companys credit ratings improve to competitive investment grade levels, access to the capital markets for cash needs will retain an element of uncertainty. As such, management intends to maintain sufficient cash investment levels to ensure support for operational business needs, strategic initiatives, including opportunistic purchase of selected real estate properties attributable to consolidation within the retail industry, long term debt maturities, dividends and contingency items, such as the cash contributions made to the Companys qualified pension plan. Under the Companys 2006 financing plan, no issuances or retirements of long term debt are planned. The Company does not expect to borrow under its credit facility except to support ongoing letters of credit. The Companys next long term debt maturities are in 2007, when approximately $425 million of long term debt is scheduled to mature. The Companys cash flows may be impacted by many factors, including the competitive conditions in the retail industry, the effects of the economic environment and consumer confidence levels. Based on the nature of the Companys business, management considers the above factors to be normal business risks. Inventory Total LIFO inventory was $3,210 million at the end of 2005 compared with $3,142 million at the end of 2004. FIFO inventory was $3,234 million at the end of 2005, an increase of 2.1% when compared to last years $3,167 million. After an effective transition from fall and holiday assortments, the Company was well positioned at the end of 2005 with fresh merchandise for the spring season. Inventory also reflected a good balance between fashion and basic merchandise. With new systems and its network of store distribution centers, the Company has continued to enhance its ability to allocate and flow merchandise to stores in season by recognizing sales trends earlier and accelerating receipts, replenishing individual stores based on rates of sale and consistently providing high in stock levels in basics and advertised items. This continued improvement of inventory management has helped to drive more profitable sales. With the elimination of global trade quotas, the Company may concentrate production in fewer countries and factories over time. The Company has implemented contingency plans that include the identification of alternate sources for product in order to provide uninterrupted access to merchandise. Cost reductions will allow the Company to invest in higher quality merchandise and thereby improve the value proposition to the Companys target customer. 31 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Contractual Obligations and Commitments Aggregated information about the Companys obligations and commitments to make future contractual payments, such as debt and lease agreements, and contingent commitments as of January 28, 2006 is presented in the following table. Contractual Obligations and Commitments ($ in millions) Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 After 5 Years Recorded contractual obligations: Long term debt, including current maturities and capital leases $ 3,465 $ 21 $ 434 $ 203 $ $ 506 $ 2,301 Trade payables 1,171 1,171 Contributions to non qualified supplemental retirement and postretirement medical plans(1) 378 75 71 72 21 20 119 $ 5,014 $ 1,267 $ 505 $ 275 $ 21 $ 526 $ 2,420 Unrecorded contractual obligations: Interest payments on long term debt and capital leases(2) $ 6,097 $ 276 $ 253 $ 222 $ 218 $ 198 $ 4,930 Operating leases(3) 1,664 201 162 146 134 119 902 Standby and import letters of credit(4) 139 139 Surety bonds(5) 59 59 Contractual obligations(6) 195 149 39 5 1 1 Guarantees(7) 56 8 7 3 38 $ 8,210 $ 832 $ 461 $ 373 $ 356 $ 317 $ 5,871 Total $ 13,224 $ 2,099 $ 966 $ 648 $ 377 $ 843 $ 8,291 (1) Includes expected payments through 2015. Based on the accounting rules for retirement and postretirement benefit plans, the liabilities reflected in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets differ from these estimated future payments. See Note 17. (2) The 2006 interest payments include $95 million that is reflected in Accrued Expenses and Other in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet at January 28, 2006. See Note 7.

(4) Standby letters of credit ($132 million at January 28, 2006) are issued as collateral to a third party administrator for self insured workers compensation and general liability claims. The remaining $7 million are outstanding import letters of credit. (5) Surety bonds are primarily for previously incurred and expensed obligations related to workers compensation and general liability claims. (6) Consists primarily of (a) minimum purchase requirements for exclusive merchandise and fixtures; (b) royalty obligations; and (c) minimum obligations for professional services, energy services, software maintenance and network services. (7) Includes (a) $18 million for certain personal property leases assumed by the purchasers of Eckerd; (b) $18 million on loans related to a real estate investment trust; and (c) $20 million related to a third party reinsurance guarantee. 32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The Company is predominantly engaged in the retailing business of buying and selling merchandise. In the normal course of business, the Company issues purchase orders to vendors/suppliers for merchandise inventory to meet customer demand for fashion, seasonal and basic merchandise. The Companys purchase orders are not unconditional commitments but, rather, represent executory contracts requiring performance by vendors/suppliers, including delivery of the merchandise prior to a specified cancellation date and meeting product specifications and other requirements. Failure to meet agreed upon terms and conditions may result in the cancellation of the order. Accordingly, the table above excludes outstanding purchase orders for merchandise inventory that has not been shipped. Under the terms of the purchase orders, merchandise is purchased on a F.O.B. (Free on Board) shipping point basis. As a result, the cost of merchandise shipped but not received by the Company as of year end (in transit merchandise) is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Merchandise Inventory with a corresponding offset in Trade Payables. As of January 28, 2006, the Company had approximately $400 million of domestic and foreign in transit merchandise, which together with trade payables for merchandise already received, is reflected in the table above. Additionally, the Company issues letters of credit for selected merchandise inventory sourced overseas, which are also included in the table above. Credit Agreement The Company, JCP and J. C. Penney Purchasing Corporation are parties to a five year $1.2 billion revolving credit facility (2005 Credit Facility) with a syndicate of lenders with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. The 2005 Credit Facility is unsecured, and all collateral securing the previously existing $1.5 billion credit facility has been released. The 2005 Credit Facility is available for general corporate purposes, including the issuance of letters of credit. Pricing under the 2005 Credit Facility is tiered based on JCPs senior unsecured long term debt ratings by Moodys and Standard & Poors. JCPs obligations under the 2005 Credit Facility are guaranteed by the Company. No borrowings, other than the issuance of trade and standby letters of credit, which totaled $139 million as of the end of 2005, have been made under this facility. The 2005 Credit Facility includes two financial leverage metric covenants, which are discussed on pages 24 26. Credit Ratings Improvements in the Companys operating performance and financial metrics led to its long term debt credit rating being raised to investment grade level by Fitch Ratings in 2005 and by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. in early 2006. Restoring competitive investment grade credit ratings, consistent with retail industry leaders, continues to be a financial goal for the Company. As of March 20, 2006, the Companys credit ratings and outlook were as follows: Corporate Family Rating Long Term Debt Outlook Moodys Investors Service, Inc. Baa3 Baa3 Stable Standard & Poors Ratings Services BB+ BB+ Positive Fitch Ratings N/A BBB Stable During February 2006, Moodys raised its senior unsecured credit rating for the Company from Ba1 to a Baa3 investment grade rating, citing the Companys continued strong liquidity, healthy free cash flow generation, solid leverage and coverage metrics and managements balanced approach to financial 33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements policy. In addition, Moodys raised its corporate family debt rating (previously named the senior implied rating) from Ba1 to Baa3, revised its outlook for the Company to Stable and withdrew its speculative grade liquidity rating of SGL 1. During 2005, Standard & Poors raised its credit rating outlook from Stable to Positive. Also during 2005, Fitch raised its credit rating on the Companys senior unsecured notes and debentures and its $1.2 billion revolving credit facility from BB+ to a BBB investment grade rating and revised its outlook for the Company to Stable. On February 17, 2006, Standard & Poors placed the Company on a credit watch with positive rating implications. Going forward, the Company expects that the rating agencies will continue to focus on operating performance consistency, earnings growth and financial leverage as key factors in any ratings decisions. Indenture Covenant The Company has an indenture covering approximately $254 million of long term debt that contains a financial covenant requiring the Company to have a minimum of 200% net tangible assets to senior funded indebtedness (as defined in the indenture). This indenture permits the Company to issue additional long term debt if it is in compliance with the covenant. As of year end 2005, the Companys percent of net tangible assets to senior funded indebtedness was 273%. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than operating leases, which are included in the Contractual Obligations and Commitments table on page 32, the Company does not have any off balance sheet financing. The Company has not created, and is not party to, any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating its business. As of January 28, 2006, the Company had guarantees of approximately $18 million for certain personal property leases assumed by the purchasers of Eckerd, which were previously reported as operating leases. Currently, management does not believe that any potential financial exposure related to these guarantees would have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. JCP, through JCP Realty, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, has investments in 14 partnerships that own regional mall properties, six as general partner and eight as limited partner. JCPs potential exposure to risk is greater in partnerships in which it is a general partner. Mortgages on the six general partnerships total approximately $325 million; however, the estimated market value of the underlying properties is approximately $782 million. These mortgages are non recourse to JCP, so any financial exposure is minimal. In addition, JCP Realty, Inc. has guaranteed loans totaling approximately $18 million related to an investment in a real estate investment trust. The estimated market value of the underlying properties significantly exceeds the outstanding mortgage loans, and the loan guarantee to market value ratio is less than 4% as of January 28, 2006. In the event of possible default, the creditors would recover first from the proceeds of the sale of the properties, next from the general partner, then from other guarantors before JCPs guarantee would be invoked. As a result, management does not believe that any potential financial exposure related to this guarantee would have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. As part of the 2001 sale of the assets of the Companys Direct Marketing Services subsidiary, JCP signed a guarantee agreement with a maximum exposure of $20 million. Any potential claims or losses are first recovered from established reserves, then from the purchaser and finally from any state insurance guarantee fund before JCPs guarantee would be invoked. As a result, management does not believe that any potential exposure would have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. 34 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The Company does not have any additional arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements. Capital Structure Repositioning By the end of 2005, the Company had completed its 2005 and 2004 equity and debt reduction programs, which focused on enhancing stockholder value, strengthening the Companys capital structure and improving its credit rating profile. The Company used the $3.5 billion in net cash proceeds from the sale of the Eckerd drugstore operations, $260 million in net cash proceeds from the sale of Renner stock, cash proceeds and tax benefits from the exercise of employee stock options and existing cash and short term investment balances, including free cash flow generated in 2004, to fund the programs, which consisted of common stock repurchases, debt reduction and redemption of all outstanding shares of Series B ESOP Convertible Preferred Stock (Preferred Stock). Common Stock Repurchases The Companys common stock repurchase programs totaled $4.15 billion, and consisted of 2005 authorizations of $750 million and $400 million, combined with a 2004 authorization of $3.0 billion. In total, the 94.3 million shares repurchased represented nearly 30% of the common share equivalents the Company had outstanding at the time of the Eckerd sale in 2004 when the program was initiated, including shares issuable under convertible debt securities. Share repurchases were made in open market transactions. Of the total share repurchases, 44.2 million shares of common stock were repurchased in 2005 for a total principal cost of $2.2 billion, and 50.1 million shares of common stock were repurchased in 2004 for a total principal cost of $1.95 billion. Debt Reduction The Companys debt reduction programs, which were completed by the end of the second quarter of 2005, consisted of approximately $2.14 billion of debt reductions. The Companys debt retirements included $250 million of open market debt repurchases in the first half of 2005, the payment of $193 million of long term debt at the scheduled maturity date in May 2005 and 2004 transactions that consisted of $650 million of debt converted to common stock, $822 million of cash payments and the termination of the $221 million Eckerd securitized receivables program. The Company incurred pre tax charges of $18 million in 2005 related to these early debt retirements. During 2004, the Company incurred total pre tax charges of $47 million related to early debt retirements. Series B Convertible Preferred Stock Redemption On August 26, 2004, the Company redeemed, through conversion to common stock, all of its outstanding shares of Preferred Stock. All of these shares were held by the Companys Savings, Profit Sharing and Stock Ownership Plan, a 401(k) savings plan. Each holder of Preferred Stock received 20 equivalent shares of JCPenney common stock for each share of Preferred Stock in their Savings Plan account in accordance with the original terms of the Preferred Stock. Preferred Stock shares, which were included in the diluted earnings per share calculation as appropriate, were converted into approximately nine million common stock shares. Annual dividend savings approximated $11 million after tax. 35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Common Stock Outstanding During 2005, the number of outstanding shares of common stock changed as follows, primarily as a result of the capital structure repositioning programs: (in millions) Outstanding Common Shares Balance as of January 29, 2005 271 Repurchase and retirement of common stock (44) Exercise of stock options 6 Balance as of January 28, 2006 233 Risk Management Management recognizes its ongoing responsibility to proactively manage risks effectively in order to maximize enterprise value (defined as the combined capital markets value of the Companys debt and equity) to investors. The Company is subject to risks inherent in operating a multi channel retailing organization. Management defines risk as the potential deviation from planned operating results that may have a negative impact on investor enterprise value in the short or long term. The deviation can arise from inadequate or ineffective internal processes or systems, external events or Company personnel. The key driver in managing strategic and operating risks in order to maximize enterprise value is consistent execution of the Long Range Plan initiatives, which are described below. During the 2001 2005 turnaround period, the Companys enterprise value increased significantly and its portfolio of risks was managed effectively. Managing strategic and operating risks provides both opportunities to capitalize on positive events and mitigate negative circumstances. Strategies of the Long Range Plan To transition the Company from a turnaround to a position of leadership within the retail industry, and realize the Companys vision of becoming the preferred choice for the American moderate shopper, the Company is focused on four key strategies: 1) making an emotional connection with the customer, 2) making JCPenney an easy and exciting place to shop, 3) making JCPenney a great place to work and 4) making JCPenney a leader in performance and execution. The first strategy making an emotional connection with the customer involves offering styles that inspire and reflect the lifestyles of the Companys target customer, building JCPenney private brands to develop customer loyalty, providing quality merchandise at smart prices and developing powerful marketing that attracts new and existing customers to visit JCPenney on a regular basis. Based on extensive customer research, the Company introduced lifestyle merchandising, which led to the 2005 launch of several new private and exclusive brands, including nicole by Nicole Miller&reg;, W Work to Weekend, a.n.a (a casual weekend line) and an expansion of the Chris Madden for JCPenney Home Collection&reg;. In addition, the Company shifted a portion of the marketing dollars spent in 2005 from promotional advertising to elevating the branding message of both JCPenney and the Companys private brands. This shift continued in 2006, with the most visible of these efforts being the JCPenney Experience, a 15,000 square foot virtual store that was opened in Times Square in New York City for three weeks in 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements March 2006, which coincided with the Companys exclusive retail sponsorship of the Academy Awards for the fifth year in a row. Key to the Companys success will be the customers response to these initiatives, including the effectiveness of marketing programs. The Company measures customer satisfaction on an ongoing basis through a customer scorecard, which benchmarks customer perceptions against key competitors. In addition, management continues to focus on measuring marketing productivity by utilizing post event analyses and other measurement tools. The Companys merchandise assortments consist of national brands, exclusive designer brands, such as nicole by Nicole Miller&reg;, and private brands, which represented over 40% of sales in 2005. Product development and sourcing is critical to the success of the private brand business. Management has established processes to optimize order flow by country and to reduce the cycle time, from the design stage to getting the merchandise to the department stores. The Company diversifies its sourcing and production by country, and even with the elimination of global trade quotas that could concentrate production in fewer countries, the Company believes it has sufficient diversification to minimize any potential negative impact on cycle time improvements. The Company has implemented contingency plans that include the identification of alternate sources for product and the uninterrupted access to product. Cost reductions will allow the Company to invest in higher quality merchandise, which will increase the value proposition to the Companys target customer. The Company could also be impacted by logistical or other issues faced by suppliers or have an interruption in one of the Companys store distribution centers. However, the Company has a diversified supplier base, both domestic and foreign, and is not dependent to any significant degree on any single supplier. Additionally, the Company has business continuity plans in place for all merchandise distribution centers that would provide rerouting of merchandise allocations to have uninterrupted flow of merchandise to both stores and direct to customers. The second strategy making JCPenney an easy and exciting place to shop relates to the Companys initiatives to interact with customers in a pleasant and efficient manner, communicate clearly, and add interest, newness and excitement to the shopping experience. The Company describes its target customer as having too little time, too little money, and two little kids. As a result, the Companys goal is to make the shopping experience as seamless as possible, whether the customer is in the store, shopping from one of the Companys many catalogs, or on jcp.com. Management has taken several actions to improve the customer shopping experience, including improving the connectivity of the shopping channels, by investing in renovating existing stores and enhancing and standardizing store layout and in store visual displays, investing in new stores, particularly the off mall format, as well as reconfiguring the store staffing model to better serve customers while providing cost efficiencies. The Company launched the rollout of a new point of sale (POS) system that reduces transaction time and will provide Internet connectivity to all in store POS devices to enhance the customer shopping experience. During 2005, more than 430 stores were converted to the new technology, with the remaining stores scheduled for conversion in 2006. In addition, the Company has strengthened its market presence by opening new stores and renovating existing stores. Performance of new stores (both mall and off mall) continues to exceed the Companys expectations. The Company opened 18 new stores in 2005, 11 of which were off mall, bringing the total off mall stores to more than 20. The Company has resources dedicated to conducting strategic market data research, including demographic and regional economic trends, prior to making a decision to enter or relocate into a 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements particular geographic area. The Company conducts ongoing benchmarking of key metrics for all geographic markets, including market share, sales growth, sales per square foot, and competitor and population trends. The success of store renovations and changes to visual presentations are dependent on whether customers find them appealing and exciting. As mentioned above, the Company regularly measures customer satisfaction through a customer scorecard, which benchmarks customer perceptions against key competitors. Also, as part of the new POS system, beginning in 2006, customers will be asked to rate their overall shopping experience with JCPenney at the point of sale. Benchmarking provides an opportunity to learn from best practices both outside and inside the Company, and thereby enhance the Companys ability to achieve its customer centered strategies to make an emotional connection with the JCPenney customer and make JCPenney an easy and exciting place to shop, with the ultimate goal of obtaining a higher market share within the retail sector. The third strategy making JCPenney a great place to work recognizes the importance of attracting, developing and retaining the best people in retail, and creating and sustaining a customer focused culture. Building on the Companys founding values, the current initiatives to make JCPenney a great place to work are embodied in principles that management has labeled Winning Together Principles. These principles relate to fostering an environment of teamwork, striving for excellence in the quality of products and services, acting with the highest level of integrity, coaching associates to perform at the highest level, encouraging creative thinking and innovation, recognizing individual contributions and fostering a sense of community. The ultimate goal of following the Winning Together Principles is to build lasting relationships with customers by offering a superior shopping experience and value, and delivering strong financial performance and value to the Companys stockholders. In connection with this initiative, during the fall of 2005, the Company conducted an associate engagement survey, which was designed to measure associate views of the Company and assist management in determining how best to achieve the Long Range Plan initiatives. In addition, in January 2006, the Company hosted all store managers for a two day meeting near the Companys Home Office. In response to associate survey results, the Company is launching a number of current initiatives that, combined with the positive operating performance in 2005, are expected to enhance a winning atmosphere. Management believes that being part of a winning team is something that all associates can be proud of and should contribute to the Companys ability, over time, to accomplish its strategy of making JCPenney a great place to work. The fourth strategy making JCPenney a leader in performance and execution focuses on earnings per share growth through maintaining consistent, competitive sales growth, increasing the productivity of assets, including inventory and selling space, optimizing operating speed and cycle time, improving gross margin, and leveraging the expense structure leading to top quartile performance in the retail industry. The Companys performance in 2005 represented significant strides in its progress toward industry leadership, and was the result of continued improvement in operating results and the completion of capital structure repositioning programs. As a result, the Companys operating performance and financial profile are effectively one year ahead of the original plan, and the Companys key financial metrics returns on capital and financial leverage are now in substantial alignment with retail industry leaders. Planning targets are established in all areas of the business, including those related to operating goals, key financial metrics, cash flow, credit ratings, dividends and earnings growth. Management regularly 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements evaluates actual results against planned targets to gauge the Companys progress in executing its Long Range Plan. Improvements in the Companys operating performance and financial metrics led to its long term debt credit rating being raised to investment grade by Fitch Ratings in 2005 and by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. in early 2006. On February 17, 2006, Standard & Poors placed the Company on a credit watch with positive rating implications. Until such time as the Company has steady and reliable access to commercial paper, it plans to maintain sufficient cash investment levels to cover peak seasonal inventory needs and contingencies. As part of its ongoing planning process, management measures key risks in terms of the potential impact on enterprise market value, operating performance, key financial metrics, and the Companys overall financial condition. This process utilizes scenario analysis and stress testing of risks that can cause variation from planned operating results and impact the Companys enterprise value. In connection with the move to a centralized business process during its turnaround period, the Company put in place state of the art merchandise planning and allocation systems. These new systems have allowed the Company to improve the planning of merchandise assortments, allocate inventory and stock stores, better track sales trends enabling prompt replenishment and make more timely pricing decisions. Key to meeting the Companys long term customer and financial goals is continued realization of the benefits from centralized buying and allocation. The effectiveness of these processes and systems is an important component of the Companys ability to have the right inventory at the right place, time and price. Another key Company initiative is reducing private brand cycle time the time it takes from concept until the merchandise hits the selling floor. With the Companys most recent private brand launch, a.n.a, management was able to substantially reduce the cycle time. As discussed under the first strategy above, the Companys substantial sourcing abilities should enable the Company to continue to reduce the product lead times and offer customers more relevant and timely merchandise. The Companys operations are dependent upon the integrity, security and consistent operation of various systems and data centers, including the new point of sale systems in the stores, data centers that process transactions, communication systems and various software applications used throughout the Company to track inventory flow, process transactions and generate performance and financial reports. The Company seeks to minimize operational risk associated with communication and information systems through the development of back up systems and emergency plans. The Company has disaster prevention and recovery plans in place should events occur that could interrupt operations. Ongoing assessment and testing is being conducted to minimize current and future risk. There is a process in place to provide regular associate training, operating instructions and site visits to help limit operational defects or mistakes. The Companys success depends on its effective execution of the four key strategies discussed above in progressing toward its overall vision to become the preferred shopping choice for Middle America. The Company also recognizes that to achieve these strategies it must maintain its reputation among many constituents customers, suppliers, investors and regulators, as well as the general public for business practices of the highest ethical quality. Attention to integrity and reputation has always been a key aspect of the Companys practices and maintenance of reputation is the responsibility of everyone in the organization. The Company supports this individual responsibility in many ways, including a code of ethics, training, policies, reporting mechanisms and oversight through the Companys Legal Compliance and Business Ethics Committee, which is discussed below. 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The Institutional Investor (II) magazine rankings for Americas Most Shareholder Friendly Companies were announced in February 2006. JCPenney was one of four award winners in the Retailing/Broadlines and Department Stores category. Rankings were determined by survey results from over a thousand portfolio managers, buy side and sell side analysts asked to name the companies in their areas of expertise that are the most attentive to shareholders. The survey instructed respondents to consider the quality of the companies governance and investor relations practices. Additionally, JCPenney was one of three companies recognized by buy side analysts and portfolio managers in IIs ranking of investor relations practices in the Retailing/Department Stores and Broadline Discounters category, which were announced in March 2006. Risk Management Framework The Company has an enterprise wide risk management framework in place to identify, measure and manage risks. The Companys organizational structure, both at the Board and management levels, plays a critical role in maintaining an effective overall risk management process, as highlighted by the risk management and monitoring processes described below. Independent Oversight Several Board committees oversee the risk governance activities of the senior management committees. The Audit Committee is responsible for discussion of guidelines and policies governing the process by which risk assessment and management is undertaken. In addition, the Audit Committee reviews with management the systems of internal control over financial reporting that are relied upon to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with the Companys operational risk management processes. The Finance Committee reviews the Companys overall financial policies, strategies and capital structure. The Human Resources and Compensation Committee oversees senior management committees responsible for retirement and welfare plans, equity and other compensation plans. The Corporate Governance Committee monitors developments in the governance area and recommends policies and practices to the Board of Directors. Executive Board The Executive Board, comprised of the top members of senior management, meets monthly and is involved in the development of corporate strategy, monthly review of operational and financial results, progress on planned initiatives and other matters that relate to the leadership and management of the Company. The Executive Board also provides direction for managing the portfolio of risks throughout the enterprise. Legal Compliance and Business Ethics Committee (Ethics Committee) This Committee provides assistance to the Chief Ethics Officer in ensuring that the Companys legal compliance and ethics program is effective under applicable laws and regulations. The Ethics Committees responsibilities include assessing the risks of non compliance with applicable law or regulation and of unethical conduct by associates or agents of the Company; determining how best to mitigate such risks through the promulgation and or revision of written compliance and ethics standards, including the Companys Statement of Business Ethics; and the communication of such standards through training, auditing, monitoring and other forms of checking; encouraging associates to report possible violations of Company compliance and ethics related standards. The Ethics Committee also oversees internal investigations into possible violations of law or Company policy and the discipline imposed for any violations of Company policy. The Ethics Committee also assists the Chief Ethics Officer in reporting, no less than annually, to the Board and the Audit Committee of the Board on the operation, content and effectiveness of the Companys legal compliance and ethics program. 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Human Resources Committee (HRC) The HRC, which is made up of senior executives of the Company, ensures appropriate management and fiduciary responsibilities are carried out with respect to retirement and welfare plans, and manages and provides direction for equity and compensation plan strategies. Capital Appropriations Committee (CAC) The CAC reviews and approves individual capital and systems projects, and ensures proper capital allocation consistent with the overall capital expenditure plan approved by the Board of Directors. Disclosure and Controls Review Committee (DCRC) and Sarbanes Oxley Compliance and Monitoring Group The DCRC is made up of senior executives of the Company, including the CEO and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO). The DCRC ensures that the Companys established disclosure controls and procedures and certification process are adhered to. The Company has a Sarbanes Oxley Compliance and Monitoring Group, which consists of associates dedicated full time to managing the ongoing process of monitoring and self testing key controls throughout the organization, documenting and testing significant changes to internal controls over financial reporting and meeting the related reporting requirements. Independent Support Functions Internal Audit, Legal and Finance support the Companys risk management function. They operate independently of the operating divisions of the Company. As an important component of the Companys control structure, the Internal Audit department reports functionally to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Internal Audit performs reviews and completes test work to ensure that: (a) risks are appropriately identified and managed; (b) interaction with various internal governance groups, such as the legal compliance coordinators, occurs as needed; (c) significant financial, managerial and operating information is reliable and timely; (d) associates actions are in compliance with policies, standards, procedures and applicable laws and regulations; (e) resources are acquired economically, used efficiently and adequately protected; (f) quality and continuous improvement are fostered in the organizations control process; and (g) significant legislative or regulatory issues impacting the organization are recognized and addressed appropriately. Legal compliance coordinators, working with Internal Audit, are responsible for ensuring that all areas of the Company maintain effective compliance procedures. Internal Control During 2005, the Company focused on further tightening its overall internal control structure by having Internal Audit conduct a comprehensive fraud risk assessment. Further enhancement of the Companys fraud controls include providing additional anti fraud training in both store and non store areas, embedding fraud considerations and audit procedures in Internal Audits ongoing processes and ongoing discussions between management and the Companys Audit Committee in their oversight role and discussing managements actions and programs to control and monitor the Companys major fraud risks. The Company is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting in order to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the timely and accurate preparation of financial statements for external purposes. Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, starting at year end 2004, management is required to report publicly on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting and has included Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting for 2005 on page 51. Additionally, the Companys external auditors are required to express an opinion on managements assessment as well as on the effectiveness 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. KPMG LLPs report as of year end 2005 is included beginning on page 51. Ineffective internal control over financial reporting would not allow the Company to adequately prevent or detect misstatement of its financial statements or adequately safeguard the use of its assets. In preparation for the initial reporting under Section 404, the Company established a Sarbanes Oxley Steering Committee to oversee the Companys progress and status. The Company dedicated significant internal resources in order to ensure that both its internal controls and the related documentation were sufficient and to test the effectiveness of identified key controls. The Company continues to dedicate full time resources in order to ensure that its internal control over financial reporting remains effective and adequately documented. Other Risk Factors The Companys business is subject to other risk factors, both internal and external, that may impact future operating and financial performance, such as regulatory and legal risks, changes in tax laws, inflation and the possibility of catastrophic events, including the occurrence of significant weather related or other natural disasters or human made disasters, such as those arising from acts of terrorism. The Company has a number of integrated programs in place to mitigate the financial impact from property losses or third party liability claims. Each year, management reviews the level of risk that will be retained by the Company and the portion of risk that will be supported by conventional insurance contracts. The Companys strong financial profile, business continuity plans, and third party insurance where appropriate, mitigate the risk that any single risk event would have a material impact on the Companys financial position or operations. Critical Accounting Policies The application of accounting policies necessarily involves judgment and, in certain instances, the use of estimates and assumptions. Different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Management believes that the accounting policies used to develop estimates that are the most critical to understanding and evaluating the Companys reported results relate to: inventory valuation under the retail method of accounting; valuation of long lived assets; estimation of reserves and valuation allowances, specifically related to closed stores, insurance, income taxes, litigation and environmental contingencies; and pension accounting. Although the Company also has other policies considered key accounting policies, such as revenue recognition, these policies do not require management to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective. The Companys management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board and its independent auditors. The Audit Committee has reviewed the Companys disclosures relating to these policies in this Managements Discussion and Analysis. For a complete list of the Companys significant accounting policies, see Note 1, which begins on page F 7. Inventory Valuation under the Retail Method Inventories are valued primarily at the lower of cost (using the last in, first out or LIFO method) or market, determined by the retail method for department stores and store distribution centers, and standard cost, representing average vendor cost, for Direct and regional warehouses. Under the retail method, inventory is segregated into groupings of merchandise having similar characteristics and is stated at its current retail selling value. Inventory retail values are converted to a cost basis by applying 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements specific average cost factors to each grouping of merchandise. Cost factors represent the average cost to retail ratio for each merchandise group based on the beginning of period inventory plus the current periods purchase activity, as calculated on a monthly basis, for each store location. Accordingly, a significant assumption under retail method accounting is that the inventory in each group of merchandise is similar in terms of its cost to retail relationship and has similar gross margin and turnover rates. Management monitors the content of merchandise in these groupings to ensure distortions that would have a material effect on inventory valuation do not occur. The retail method inherently requires management judgment and certain estimates that may significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost, as well as gross margin. Among others, two of the most significant estimates are permanent reductions to retail prices (markdowns) used to clear unproductive or slow moving inventory and inventory shortages (shrinkage). Permanent markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded at the point of decision, when the utility of inventory has diminished, versus the point of sale. Factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand, customer preferences, age of the merchandise and style trends. The corresponding reduction to gross margin is also recorded in the period the decision is made. Shrinkage is estimated as a percentage of sales for the period from the last inventory date to the end of the fiscal year. Physical inventories are taken at least annually for all department stores, store distribution centers, warehouses and Direct fulfillment centers on a staggered basis throughout the year, and inventory records are adjusted accordingly. The shrinkage rate from the most recent physical inventory, in combination with current events and historical experience, is used as the standard for the shrinkage accrual rate for the next inventory cycle. To estimate the effects of inflation/deflation on ending inventory, an internal index measuring price changes from the beginning to the end of the year is calculated using merchandise cost data at the item level. Valuation of Long Lived Assets Management evaluates recoverability of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, for example, when a stores performance falls below minimum Company standards. In the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, management reviews the performance of individual stores. Underperforming stores are selected for further evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying amounts. If the evaluation, done on an undiscounted cash flow basis, indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, the potential impairment is measured as the excess of carrying value over the fair value of the impaired asset. Management estimates fair value based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate that is considered to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the Companys current business model. Additional factors are taken into consideration, such as local market conditions, operating environment, mall performance and other trends. Impairment losses totaling $7 million, $12 million and $26 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, were recorded for underperforming department stores and underutilized Direct and other facilities. If different assumptions were made or different market conditions were present, any estimated potential impairment amounts could vary from recorded amounts. 43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Reserves and Valuation Allowances Based on an overall analysis of store performance and expected trends, management periodically evaluates the need to close underperforming stores. Reserves are established at the point of closure for the present value of any remaining operating lease obligations (PVOL), net of estimated sublease income, and at the point of decision for severance and other exit costs, as prescribed by SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. See further discussion in Note 1 on page F 16. Two key assumptions in calculating the reserve include the timeframe expected to terminate lease agreements and estimation of other related exit costs. If different assumptions were used regarding the timing and potential termination costs, the resulting reserves could vary from recorded amounts. Reserves are reviewed periodically and adjusted, when necessary. The Company records a provision for workers compensation and general liability risk based on historical experience, current claims data and independent actuarial best estimates, including incurred but not reported claims. The Company targets this provision above the midpoint of the actuarial range, and total estimated claim liability amounts are discounted using a risk free rate. Income taxes are estimated for each jurisdiction in which the Company operates. This involves assessing the current tax exposure together with temporary differences, which result from differing treatment of items for tax and book purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are provided for based on these assessments. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for recoverability based on estimated future taxable income. To the extent that recovery is deemed unlikely, a valuation allowance is recorded. During 2005, management determined that the Company will more likely than not generate sufficient income over the next several years to utilize state tax net operating losses for which a valuation allowance had been recorded. This valuation allowance was appropriately reversed. Tax reserves are provided for when the Company considers that it is probable that taxes will be due. Such reserves are evaluated and adjusted as appropriate, while taking into account the progress of audits of various taxing jurisdictions. Management does not expect the outcome of tax audits to have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. Many years of data have been incorporated into the determination of tax reserves, and the Companys estimates have historically been reasonable. The Company is involved in legal proceedings and governmental inquiries associated with employment and other matters. Reserves have been established based on managements best estimates of the Companys potential liability in these matters. These estimates have been developed in consultation with in house and outside counsel. Management does not believe that these proceedings and inquiries, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. See further discussion in Note 20. Reserves for potential environmental liabilities related to facilities, most of which the Company no longer operates, are adjusted based on the Companys experience, as well as consultation with independent engineering firms and in house legal counsel, as appropriate. Management continues to believe established reserves are adequate to cover estimated potential liabilities. Pension Pension Accounting JCP sponsors a non contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan (the primary pension plan), supplemental retirement plans for certain management associates and other postretirement benefit 44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements plans. Refer to Note 17 for further discussion of these plans. Major assumptions used in accounting for these plans include the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate. Assumptions are determined based on Company information and market indicators and are evaluated at each annual measurement date (October 31). A change in any of these assumptions could have a significant effect on the Companys pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs. These assumptions require significant judgment, and the calculation of pension costs is relatively complex. The Company utilizes third parties, including actuarial and investment advisory firms, to help evaluate the appropriateness of the expected rate of return, the discount rate and other pension plan assumptions annually. The following discussion relates to the primary pension plan only, since it represents the majority of the Companys recorded pension expense and related asset/liability amounts in its consolidated financial statements. Demographic Assumptions For purposes of estimating demographic mortality in the measurement of the Companys pension obligation, as of October 31, 2004, the Company began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives, projected to 2005, using Scale AA to forecast mortality improvements five years into the future to 2005. Previously, the Company had utilized the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table, which it continues to use for calculating funding requirements based on Internal Revenue Service regulations. This change did not have a material impact on the projected benefit obligation. Market Related Value of Plan Assets In accounting for pension costs, the Company uses fair value, which is the market value of plan assets as of the annual measurement date, to calculate the expected return on assets and gain/loss amortization components of net periodic pension expense. Return on Plan Assets To develop its expected return on plan assets, the Company considers its long term asset allocation policy, historical returns on plan assets and overall capital market returns, taking into account current and expected market conditions. The Companys primary pension plan is well diversified with an asset allocation policy that provides for a targeted 70%, 20% and 10% mix of equities (U.S., non U.S. and private), fixed income (investment grade and high yield) and real estate (private and public), respectively. This allocation provides the pension plan with the appropriate balance of investment return and volatility risk, given the funded nature of the plan, its present and future liability characteristics and its long term investment horizon. See Note 17 for a further discussion of the asset allocation strategy for plan assets. Since the inception of the Companys primary pension plan in 1966 through the October 31, 2005 measurement date, the average annual return has been 9.5%. After three years of decline in the fair value of pension assets during the 2000 2002 bear market, pension assets experienced significant increases due to three years of annual gains in global equity markets in 2003, 2004 and 2005. The one year return on plan assets was 13.2% through October 31, 2005, following one year returns on plan assets through October 31, 2004 and October 31, 2003 of 11.7% and 19.5%, respectively. Because the fair value of plan assets is measured as of a point in time, the change in fair value between measurement dates affects the subsequent years net pension expense. The increase in fair value in 2004 and 2003 positively impacted net pension expense in 2005 and 2004 and reversed the trend of net pension expense increases from 2001 to 2003. Net periodic pension expense was $69 million, $82 million and $130 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Since inception, the Companys primary pension plan has incurred cumulative pre tax expense of approximately $183 million. This is the result of cumulative pension expense during the 1966 1984 period of $366 million, cumulative 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements pension income during the 1985 2001 period of $488 million and pension expense in the 2002 2005 period totaling $305 million. In 2002, the Company lowered the expected rate of return from 9.5% to 8.9% to reflect lower historical and expected future rates of return among all asset classes. See discussion of the impact on earnings below. Discount Rate The Company lowered the discount rate used to measure the pension obligation from 5.85% to 5.80% in 2005, from 6.35% to 5.85% in 2004 and from 7.10% to 6.35% in 2003, based on the yield to maturity of a representative portfolio of AA rated corporate bonds as of the October 31 measurement dates in 2005, 2004 and 2003, with average cash flow durations similar to the pension liability. This methodology is consistent with guidance in SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, to use the rate currently available on high quality bonds and the subsequent guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission that high quality bonds should be those with at least AA rating by a recognized rating agency. Impact on Earnings and Sensitivity As a result of strong asset performance in 2004 and 2003, the Company incurred a significant decrease in 2005 and 2004 net pension costs, which incrementally improved EPS by approximately $0.03 and $0.10, respectively, compared to a reduction in EPS of $0.24 in 2003. While the 2005 positive return on plan assets is expected to lower the 2006 expense, this is somewhat offset by a lower discount rate in each of the last three years and that the Company did not make a voluntary pension contribution to its primary pension plan in 2005 due to the plans well funded position and Internal Revenue Service rules limiting tax deductible contributions. The sensitivity of the pension expense to a plus or minus one half of one percent of expected return on assets is a decrease or increase in expense of approximately $0.05 per share. The sensitivity of the pension expense to a plus or minus one half of one percent of the discount rate is a decrease or increase in expense of approximately $0.07 per share. Pension Funding Funding Policy The Companys funding policy is to maintain a well funded pension plan throughout all business and economic cycles. Maintaining a well funded plan over time provides additional financial flexibility to the Company, including lower pension expense and reduced cash contributions, especially in the event of a decline in the capital markets. In addition, a well funded plan assures associates of the plans and the Companys financial ability to continue to provide competitive retirement benefits, while at the same time being cost effective. The Company targets to maintain a funded ratio in the range of 110% to 130%, which is the plans assets as a percent of the actuarial funding liability under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Funding History Since the plans inception, the Company has contributed $1.7 billion, or approximately $1.0 billion on an after tax basis, to its primary pension plan. Over this timeframe, actual investment return on plan assets has generated a significant portion of the $7.1 billion in pension plan total value, defined as $2.8 billion in cumulative benefit payments to retired associates plus $4.3 billion in plan assets at the measurement date in 2005. In effect, the Companys cumulative after tax cash contributions over this timeframe represent approximately 14% of the plans total value (i.e., $1.0 billion as a percent of $7.1 billion). The remainder of the plans total value has been generated by the actual investment returns since inception. The Company targets to maintain its portion of the primary pension plans total value to a level of 20% or less, primarily through its funding policy and asset mix strategy. Targeting the 46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Companys portion of the pension plans total value at this level is important since cash contributions to the plan utilize capital resources from investors and have an associated cost of capital. The Company made cash contributions to its primary pension plan annually during the 1966 1983 period in order to provide an asset base to support the accelerating liability growth in the early years of the plan. Over the 1984 2005 period, the Company made cash contributions to the plan in seven years (1993 1996, 2002 2004) and no contributions in the other 15 years due to maintaining a well funded plan and the actual investment return on plan assets. Funded Status The Companys primary pension plan remains in a well funded position. Although no additional funding was required under ERISA, the Company made discretionary contributions of $300 million, or $190 million after tax, to its primary pension plan in October of 2004, 2003 and 2002. The Company did not make a discretionary contribution to the pension plan in 2005 due to the plans well funded position and Internal Revenue Service rules limiting tax deductible contributions. At October 31, 2005, plan assets of $4.3 billion were approximately 146% of the $2.9 billion ERISA funding liability. At October 31, 2004 and 2003, the funded ratios were 137% and 129%, respectively. The increase in the 2005 funded ratio resulted primarily from the improvements in the global equity markets. Expected Contributions Contributions subsequent to 2005 for the pension plan are dependent on asset returns and future discount rates and legislative changes. The Company does not anticipate mandatory funding requirements in 2006 under ERISA. It plans to make a discretionary contribution, however, if market conditions, the funded position of the pension plan, and any legislative developments allow such a contribution to be tax deductible. See Note 17 for further discussion. Accounting for Stock Based Compensation The Company has a stock based compensation plan for approximately 1,625 executives and senior management that provides for grants to associates of stock awards (stock or units, restricted or unrestricted), stock appreciation rights or options to purchase the Companys common stock. Stock Options Over the past three years, the Companys annual stock option grants under this program have averaged about 1.5% of outstanding shares, including the common stock equivalent of preferred shares. As of January 28, 2006, options to purchase 10.6 million shares of common stock, representing 4.6% of total shares, were outstanding, of which 6.0 million were exercisable. Of the exercisable options, about 85% were in the money, or had an exercise price below the closing end of year stock price of $56.21. Prior to 2005, the Company followed Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, which did not require expense recognition for stock options when the exercise price of an option equaled, or exceeded, the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Effective January 30, 2005, the Company early adopted SFAS No. 123R, which requires the use of the fair value method for accounting for all stock based compensation, including stock options. The statement was adopted using the modified prospective method of application. Under this method, in addition to reflecting compensation expense for new share based awards, expense is also recognized to reflect the remaining vesting period of awards that had been included in pro forma disclosures in prior periods. Accordingly, during 2005, the Company recorded compensation expense for stock options of $32 million ($20 million after tax), which resulted in a reduction in diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.08. This reflects the requirements of the final accounting rules to recognize 47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements compensation expense over the associate service period, which is to the earlier of the retirement eligibility date, if the grant contains provisions such that the award becomes fully vested upon retirement, or the normal vesting period. As of January 28, 2006, unrecognized or unearned compensation expense for stock options, net of estimated forfeitures, was $24 million, which will be recognized as expense over a weighted average period of approximately one year. Prior to 2005, the Company used the Black Scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of its stock option awards. For grants subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company estimates the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using a binomial lattice model developed by outside consultants who worked with the Company in the implementation of SFAS No. 123R. The Company believes that the binomial lattice model is a more accurate model for valuing employee stock options since it better reflects the impact of stock price changes on option exercise behavior. The expected volatility used in the binomial lattice model is based on an analysis of historical prices of JCPenneys stock and open market exchanged options, and was developed in consultation with an outside valuation specialist and the Companys financial advisors. The expected volatility reflects the volatility implied from a price quoted for a hypothetical call option with a duration consistent with the expected life of the options and the volatility implied by the trading of options to purchase the Companys stock on open market exchanges. As a result of the Companys recently completed turnaround that began in 2001 and the disposition of the Eckerd drugstore operations, a significant portion of historical volatility is not considered to be a good indicator of future volatility. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the binomial lattice model, and represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding. This model incorporates an early exercise assumption in the event of a significant increase in stock price. The risk free rate is based on zero coupon U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the date of grant with the same period as the expected option life. The dividend yield is assumed to increase ratably to the Companys expected dividend yield level based on targeted payout ratios over the expected life of the options. The Company has not adjusted prior year financial statements under the optional modified retrospective method of application, but has disclosed the pro forma impact of expensing stock options on 2004 and 2003 in Note 1. Stock Awards The Companys stock based compensation plan also provides for grants of restricted and non restricted stock awards (shares and units) to associates and non employee members of the Board. As of January 28, 2006, there was $14 million of compensation cost not yet recognized or earned related to associate restricted stock awards, which is expected to be recognized as earned over a weighted average period of 2.8 years. See Notes 1 and 15 for more details about the Companys stock based compensation. New Accounting Pronouncements On October 6, 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS 13 1, Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred during a Construction Period. FSP FAS 13 1 requires rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period to be treated as rental expense, as opposed to capitalizing them as a part of the building or leasehold improvement. The provisions of this FSP must be applied to the first reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005 and therefore, beginning in the first quarter of 2006, the 48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Company will no longer capitalize rental costs incurred during the construction period. The Company does not expect FSP FAS 13 1 to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements, and will not adjust prior year financial statements under the optional retrospective method of application. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143. FIN 47 clarifies that an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. The provisions of FIN 47 are effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. The Company adopted FIN 47 during the fourth quarter of 2005 and recorded an asset retirement obligation in the amount of $13 million related to asbestos. There was no cumulative effect adjustment reflected in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations, and the Company will not adjust prior interim 2005 financial statements under the optional retrospective method of application. Fiscal Year 2006 On February 16, 2006, management communicated the following initial guidance for 2006, which is a 53 week fiscal year, in the Companys fourth quarter and full year 2005 earnings release: Comparable department store sales are expected to increase low single digits for 2006, and Direct sales are expected to increase low to mid single digits for the year. Full year operating profit is expected to reflect moderate year over year improvement, with contributions from both gross margin and SG&A expenses. The effective income tax rate for the year is expected to increase to approximately 37%, due to the elimination of the state tax valuation allowances in 2005. Earnings from continuing operations are expected to be in the range of $4.14 to $4.24 per share for 2006. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information This Annual Report on Form 10 K may contain forward looking statements made within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which reflect the Companys current view of future events and financial performance. The words expect, plan, anticipate, believe, intent, should, will and similar expressions identify forward looking statements. Any such forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause the Companys actual results to be materially different from planned or expected results. Those risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to competition, consumer demand, seasonality, economic conditions, including the price and availability of oil and natural gas, impact of changes in consumer credit payment terms, changes in management, retail industry consolidations, acts of terrorism or war and government activity. For additional discussion on risks and uncertainties, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, beginning on page 4 and Risk Management beginning on page 36. The Company typically earns a disproportionate share of its operating income in the fourth quarter due to holiday buying patterns, and such buying patterns are difficult to forecast with certainty. While the Company believes that its assumptions are reasonable, it cautions that it is impossible to predict the degree to which any such factors could cause actual results to differ materially from predicted results. The Company intends the forward looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K to speak only as of the date of this report and does not undertake to update or revise these projections as more information becomes available. 49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The Company maintains a majority of its cash and short term investments in financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less. Such investments are subject to interest rate risk and may have a small decline in value if interest rates increase. Since the financial instruments are of short duration, a change of 100 basis points in interest rates would not have a material effect on the Companys financial condition. The Companys outstanding long term debt as of January 28, 2006 is at fixed interest rates and would not be affected by interest rate changes. Future borrowings under the Companys multi year revolving credit facility, to the extent that fluctuating rate loans were used, would be affected by interest rate changes. As of January 28, 2006, no cash borrowings were outstanding under the facility, and approximately $139 million in letters of credit were supported by this facility. The Company does not believe that a change of 100 basis points in interest rates would have a material effect on the Companys financial condition. The fair value of long term debt is estimated by obtaining quotes from brokers or is based on current rates offered for similar debt. At January 28, 2006, long term debt, excluding equipment financing, capital leases and other, had a carrying value of $3.4 billion and a fair value of $3.7 billion. At January 29, 2005, long term debt, excluding equipment financing, capital leases and other, had a carrying value of $3.9 billion and a fair value of $4.3 billion. The effects of changes in the U.S. equity and bond markets serve to increase or decrease the value of assets in the Companys qualified pension plan, which is well funded. At the October 31, 2005 measurement date, plan assets of $4.3 billion were approximately 146% of the $2.9 billion actuarial funding liability under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). The Company seeks to manage exposure to adverse equity and bond returns by maintaining diversified investment portfolios and utilizing professional investment managers. Previously, the Company had limited exposure to market risk associated with currency exchange rates due to the foreign operations of Renner. However, with the sale of the Companys controlling interest in Renner in the second quarter of 2005, the Company recognized the cumulative loss on foreign currency translation that previously had been reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss).
