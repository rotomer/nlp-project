Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion, which presents the results of JCPenney, should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto beginning on page F 3, along with the unaudited Five Year Financial and Operations Summaries on pages 10 and 11, the risk factors beginning on page 4 and the cautionary statement regarding forward looking information on page 39. Unless otherwise indicated, this Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) relates only to results from continuing operations, all references to earnings per share (EPS) are on a diluted basis and all references to years relate to fiscal years rather than to calendar years. Fiscal 2006 contained 53 weeks, while both 2005 and 2004 contained 52 weeks. Corporate Governance and Financial Reporting The Company remains committed to both maintaining the highest standard of corporate governance and continuously improving the transparency of its financial reporting, by providing stockholders with informative financial disclosures and presenting an accurate view of the Companys financial position and operating results. Management continues to employ a reporting matrix that requires written certifications on a quarterly basis from a cross discipline team of approximately 20 members of management who have responsibility for verifying and reporting corporate results. For this Annual Report on Form 10 K, the Company made further enhancements to its financial reporting with expanded disclosures in several areas, such as: providing a breakdown of net sales by merchandise category and service sales, as a percent of total sales; clarifying the definition of comparable department store sales to explain that remodels and minor expansions not requiring store closure remain in the calculation; and reporting statistics related to inventory turnover. Consistent with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes Oxley Act), the Company is required again to report on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. In relation to these requirements, the Companys external auditors expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment of, and the effective operation of, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Executive Overview 2006 marked the completion of the second year of the Companys 2005 2009 Long Range Plan and reflected an acceleration of progress towards attaining the Companys stated financial objectives set in 2005. This progress has resulted in the evolution of the Long Range Plans fundamental strategies into updated initiatives and new financial performance goals for the five year period ending in 2011 that will be publicly announced at the Companys Analyst Meeting on April 17 18, 2007. 2006 Accomplishments Achieved Sixth Consecutive Year of Comparable Department Store Sales Growth Comparable department store sales increased 3.7% in 2006, on top of a 2.9% increase in 2005, representing the sixth consecutive year of comparable department store sales increases, averaging more than a 3% increase per year. The Company also experienced productivity improvements in its store portfolio with sales per gross square foot increasing 4.5% to $164 in 2006 from $157 in 2005. The Companys off mall stores opened in the 2003 to 2005 timeframe experienced a higher level of productivity than the Company average with 2006 sales per gross square foot of approximately $200. In Direct (Internet/catalog), the Company continues to experience a transformation into an Internet portal that functions as the customers gateway to the Company and a shopping channel supported by print media. Internet sales in 2006 were $1.3 billion, an increase of approximately 24% (22% on a 52 week basis), on top of a nearly 28% increase in 2005. Print sales and Internet sales each represented approximately 45% of total Direct sales, with the remainder from catalog outlet stores. Total Direct sales increased 4.1% (2.4% on a 52 week basis) in 2006, the fourth consecutive year of sales gains. Direct sales were approximately 15% of total net retail sales in each of the last three years. 12 Table of Contents Further Strengthened Operating Performance For 2006, operating income increased 100 basis points to 9.7% of sales, driven by substantially higher gross margin. Operating Income ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Retail sales, net $ 19,903 $ 18,781 $ 18,096 Gross margin $ 7,825 $ 7,191 $ 6,792 Operating expenses: SG&A expenses 5,521 5,227 5,135 Depreciation and amortization expenses 389 372 359 Pre opening expenses 27 15 11 Real estate and other (income)/expense (34 ) (54 ) 12 Total operating expenses 5,903 5,560 5,517 Operating income(1) $ 1,922 $ 1,631 $ 1,275 As a percent of sales 9.7% 8.7% 7.0% (1) Operating Income excludes Net Interest Expense as well as Bond Premiums and Unamortized Costs. Beginning in 2006, Real Estate and Other was included as a component of Operating Income; all prior periods shown have been reclassified to reflect this presentation. Operating Income is the key measurement on which management evaluates the financial performance of the retail operations. Income from continuing operations for 2006 increased approximately 16% to $1,134 million compared to $977 million in 2005. Diluted EPS from continuing operations of $4.88 for 2006 improved 27% compared to $3.83 in 2005. The 2006 results reflected a credit of $32 million, or $0.14 per share, due primarily to the release of federal income tax reserves resulting from the favorable resolution of prior year tax matters, while the 2005 results included a one time credit to income of $49 million, or $0.20 per share, which was principally attributable to eliminating the remaining state tax net operating loss valuation allowances as a result of the significantly improved operating performance. Excluding these tax credits, 2006 income from continuing operations and EPS increased 19% and 31%, respectively. Operating performance has improved year over year for each of the past six years, with operating income margin increasing 860 basis points since 2000 and diluted EPS from continuing operations increasing to $4.88 for 2006 from $(0.78) in 2000.

Comparable department store sales include sales of new and relocated stores, and stores reopened after being closed for an extended period (e.g., stores closed due to 2005 hurricanes), after such stores have been open for 12 full consecutive fiscal months. Stores remodeled and minor expansions not requiring store closure remain in the comparable department store sales calculation. (2) Includes the effect of the 53rd week in 2006 and 2003. Excluding sales of $50 million for the 53rd week in 2006, total Direct sales increased 2.4% for 2006. Excluding sales of $46 million for the 53rd week in 2003, total Direct sales increased 3.3% for 2004. 13 Table of Contents Accelerated Store Growth Program During 2006, JCPenney announced that it expects to open approximately 50 new stores per year from 2007 through 2009, representing annual square footage growth of approximately 3%. Signaling the launch of the Companys accelerated growth strategy, during 2006, the Company opened 28 new stores, 23 of which are in what management believes is the successful off mall format. For the year, square footage grew 1.7%. 2006 Private and Exclusive Brand Launches The Company introduced a.n.atm, a new private brand in womens casual sportswear, in early 2006. It continues to exceed managements expectations, with first year sales of more than $300 million. In late 2006, the Company launched a joint initiative with Sephora U.S.A., Inc. (Sephora). Sephora began exclusively servicing JCPenney customers online beauty needs through a link to www.sephora.com from www.jcp.com, and in early October 2006, the first five Sephora inside JCPenney locations opened. Sephora inside JCPenney locations are expected to be added to approximately 19 more JCPenney stores in the first half of 2007, with additional locations planned for the second half of the year and an accelerated rollout starting in 2008. Improved Capital Structure and Credit Profile The Companys capital structure and credit profile continued to improve during 2006, principally as a result of improved operating performance and the completion of a $750 million common stock repurchase program. Combined with the 2005 and 2004 capital structure repositioning programs, which were initiated on July 31, 2004 in conjunction with the sale of Eckerd, the programs represent an aggregate $4.9 billion of common stock repurchases and an aggregate $2.14 billion of debt reductions. To fund the programs, the Company used the $3.5 billion in net cash proceeds from the sale of the Eckerd drugstore operations, $260 million in net cash proceeds from the sale of Lojas Renner S.A. (Renner) shares, cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and existing cash and short term investment balances. Based on improvements in the Companys capital structure and related liquidity and coverage metrics, as well as the Companys improved operating performance and operating cash flow generation, several positive credit rating actions occurred in 2006. Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys) raised its senior unsecured credit rating for the Company from Ba1 to Baa3 in February 2006. Standard & Poors Ratings Services (Standard & Poors) raised its senior unsecured credit rating for the Company from BB+ to BBB in March 2006. Fitch Ratings (Fitch) raised its credit rating on the Companys senior unsecured notes and debentures and its $1.2 billion revolving credit facility from BBB to BBB in October 2006. The Company now has investment grade credit ratings from all three major credit rating agencies. Delivered Value to Stockholders From 2000 to 2006, the Company has transitioned from a turnaround to a growth mode. During this timeframe, the Companys stock price has increased from $12.81 to $83.70 and total stockholder return, which includes both stock price appreciation and the reinvestment of dividends, grew at a compound annual growth rate of 39%. Over this same period, the Company had a 53% compound earnings per share growth rate. With the stock price closing at $83.70 at the end of 2006, compared to $56.21 at the end of 2005, the Companys market capitalization rose $5.8 billion during 2006 to reach $18.9 billion at the end of 2006. Current Developments New Common Stock Repurchase Program and Dividend Increase In March 2007, the Companys Board of Directors (Board) authorized a new program of common stock repurchases of up to $400 million, which will be funded with cash and short term investment balances. The new program, which is in addition to the $750 million program completed in 2006, is expected to be completed by the end of 2007. In addition, in February 2007, the Board approved a plan to increase the quarterly dividend rate from $0.18 to $0.20 per share beginning with the May 1 quarterly dividend, bringing the expected annual dividend rate from $0.72 per share to $0.80 per share, an 11% increase. This comes on top of the 44% dividend increase in 2006. On March 29, 2007, the Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share to be paid on May 1, 2007. The Company pays dividends if, when and as declared by the Board. 14 Table of Contents New Private and Exclusive Brand Launches In February 2007, the Company launched Ambrielletm, a new private label lingerie brand. In response to feedback from customers and research of direct competitors, Ambrielletm was created to fill a void in the marketplace for a sensual lingerie brand targeted to the modern customer at a smart price. Also in February 2007, the Company launched two new exclusive brands by Liz Claiborne, Inc., Liz & Co., a traditional casual womens apparel and accessories line, and CONCEPTS by Claibornetm, featuring casual sportswear as well as suits and accessories for the modern male customer. On February 1, 2007, the Company announced its plans to launch American Livingtm, a new lifestyle brand created exclusively for the JCPenney customer by Polo Ralph Laurens Global Brand Concepts. The launch is expected to be the largest in the Companys history and will include a full range of merchandise for women, men and children, as well as intimate apparel, accessories and home goods. Polo Ralph Laurens Global Brand Concepts will be responsible for the design, production, marketing and advertising of American Livingtm, which is expected to be available in JCPenneys stores, catalog and on jcp.com beginning in spring 2008. New JCPenney Brand Positioning In February 2007, JCPenney launched its new brand positioning: Every Day Matterstm. This new branding is expected to position JCPenney as a lifestyle solution for its target customers and will be evident in every aspect of the Companys business, from its approach to merchandising to its marketing and advertising, to most importantly, its enhanced customer service, with associates focused on moving from a transactional relationship to an emotional relationship with customers. This new positioning of the JCPenney brand was unveiled to the public with a new television advertising campaign, launched during JCPenneys sixth annual exclusive retail sponsorship of the Academy Awards on February 25, 2007. Recent Awards In March 2007, JCPenney scored highest in the Broadlines and Department Store sector in Institutional Investor magazines second annual ranking of Americas Most Shareholder Friendly Companies. Rankings were determined by survey results from more than 750 portfolio managers, buy side and sell side analysts asked to name the companies in their areas of expertise that are the most responsive to shareholders. This was in addition to JCPenney being one of four award winners named in the same survey last year. Additional awards include JCPenney being listed in Fortune Magazines 2007 list of Americas Most Admired Companies, and ranking third in the General Merchandisers category. Also in March 2007, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency named J. C. Penney Company, Inc. as the 2007 ENERGY STAR Retail Partner of the Year for outstanding energy management and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The award winners are selected from thousands of organizations that participate in the ENERGY STAR program. JCPenneys accomplishments were recognized at an awards ceremony in Washington, D.C., on March 21. 15 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis, consistent with all other financial data throughout this Annual Report on Form 10 K, focuses on the results of operations and financial condition from the Companys continuing operations. Income from Continuing Operations In 2006, the Company achieved its sixth consecutive year of earnings improvement. Income from continuing operations was $1,134 million, $977 million and $657 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Earnings increased as a result of continued strong sales growth and further gross margin improvement, combined with lower interest expense and bond premiums. EPS from continuing operations increased 27% in 2006 to $4.88, compared to $3.83 in 2005 and $2.20 in 2004. EPS also benefited from the Companys common stock repurchase programs. Retail Sales, Net ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Retail sales, net $ 19,903 $ 18,781 $ 18,096 Sales percent increase: Total department stores 6.3% (1) 3.8% 3.7% (1) Comparable department stores(2) 3.7% 2.9% 4.9% Direct (Internet/catalog) 4.1% (3) 3.6% 1.5% (3) (1) Includes the effect of the 53rd week in 2006 and 2003.

Excluding sales of $152 million for the 53rd week in 2003, total department store sales increased 4.7% for 2004. (2) Comparable department store sales are presented on a 52 week basis. Comparable department store sales include sales of new and relocated stores, and stores reopened after being closed for an extended period (e.g., stores closed due to 2005 hurricanes), after such stores have been open for 12 full consecutive fiscal months. Stores remodeled and minor expansions not requiring store closure remain in the comparable department store sales calculation. (3) Includes the effect of the 53rd week in 2006 and 2003. Excluding sales of $50 million for the 53rd week in 2006, total Direct sales increased 2.4%. Excluding sales of $46 million for the 53rd week in 2003, total Direct sales increased 3.3% for 2004. Comparable department store sales increased for the sixth consecutive year, driven primarily by an increase in sales transactions, coupled with positive trends in both units per transaction and average unit retail. Department store sales increased in all merchandise divisions and across all geographic regions in 2006, reflecting positive customer response to the style, quality, selection and smart pricing offered in the Companys merchandise assortments, compelling marketing programs and continued improvement in the store shopping experience. Management was pleased with the performance of all apparel areas, especially womens. Private brand sales, including exclusive brands found only at JCPenney, totaled approximately 48%, 46% and 42% of total department store merchandise sales for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and contributed significantly to the overall 2006 sales gains. Sales for the 28 stores opened in 2006 were approximately $216 million, including $72 million for the 10 stores that were relocated. The Direct channel represented approximately 15% of total net retail sales in each of the last three years. Direct sales continue to reflect a transformation into an Internet dominated shopping channel supported by targeted specialty print media, with sales increasing 4.1%, 3.6% and 1.5% for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Internet sales increased approximately 24% in 2006 to $1,292 million, compared to $1,038 million in 2005 and $812 million in 2004. On a 52 week basis, Internet sales increased approximately 22%. Internet sales represented approximately 44% of total Direct sales for 2006, compared to 37% in 2005 and 30% in 2004. Consistent with customer shopping patterns, the Company continually reviews its catalog page counts and circulation to ensure that print catalogs remain productive. 16 Table of Contents Retail Sales Mix The following percentages represent the mix of consolidated net retail sales: 2006 2005 2004 Womens apparel 22% 22% 23% Home 21% 22% 21% Mens apparel and accessories 20% 20% 20% Childrens apparel 11% 11% 11% Womens accessories 10% 10% 9% Family footwear 6% 6% 6% Fine jewelry 5% 5% 5% Services and other 5% 4% 5% 100% 100% 100% Merchandise Initiatives Central to the Companys merchandising initiatives is the objective to become the leading retailer in offering style and quality at smart prices with merchandise that inspires and reflects the lifestyles of the Companys target customer, to continue building key JCPenney private and exclusive brands and to be a leader in offering the most desired national destination brands. Recent brand launches, which are discussed below, support these merchandising initiatives. The Company introduced a.n.atm, a private brand in womens casual sportswear and accessories, in early 2006. In September 2006, the Company launched east5thtm, a new private brand in womens traditional career wear. During the 2006 Back To School season, the Company launched X Games boys apparel as an exclusive line in over 600 JCPenney department stores and Stevies by Steve Maddentm in girls apparel. This followed other recent launches such as Vans for the young surf and skate customer, Solitude by Shaun Tomson, a California lifestyle inspired mens apparel brand, and an expanded assortment of bedding and accessories for student dorm rooms. The Company continues to experience strength in the Miss Bisou clothing collection for juniors, an extension of the Bisou Bisou womens sportswear line, and Studio by the JCPenney Home Collectiontm, a modern furniture collection, which were launched in early 2006. Also in early 2006, the Company added the Chris Madden Hotel Collection, which features silk blend comforters and 600 thread count sheets. Management is pleased with customer response and sales results for all of the Companys new and expanded merchandise launches. In April 2006, the Company announced a joint initiative with Sephora U.S.A., Inc. (Sephora), under which JCPenney has begun to sell beauty and fragrance products in its stores through Sephora inside JCPenney locations and through the Internet. In early October 2006, the first five Sephora inside JCPenney locations opened. Management is pleased with initial results and favorable customer reaction to the broad assortment of beauty brands available in these locations. Sephora inside JCPenney locations are expected to be added to approximately 19 more JCPenney stores in the first half of 2007, with additional locations planned for the second half of the year and an accelerated rollout starting in 2008. Store Shopping Experience Based on ongoing customer feedback, the Company has taken several actions to improve the customer shopping experience across all channels, including more closely aligning stores and Direct promotions to improve effectiveness while maintaining the capability to address unique customer needs in each channel. To enhance customers in store experience, the Company has invested in renovating existing stores, and enhancing and standardizing store layout and in store visual displays, accelerated the investment in new stores, particularly the off mall format, as well as reconfigured the store staffing model to better serve customers while providing cost efficiencies. The Company opened 28 new stores in 2006, 23 of which were off mall, bringing the total new off mall stores concept to more than 40 locations. Performance of new stores (both mall and off mall) continues to exceed the Companys expectations. During 2006, the Company completed its rollout of a new point of sale (POS) system to all stores. The 17 Table of Contents POS system reduces transaction time and will provide Internet connectivity to all 35,000 in store POS devices to enhance the customer shopping experience. In support of making the stores an easy and exciting place to shop, during 2006, the Company began utilizing an online survey to accumulate customer feedback on the store shopping experience. Information has been obtained in such areas as associate interactions with customers, availability of associates, attractiveness of displays and fixtures, overall store cleanliness and pricing and signing accuracy. The results are used by stores to focus efforts on improvements that will better meet their customers needs. Gross Margin ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 First in first out (FIFO) gross margin $ 7,809 $ 7,190 $ 6,774 Last in first out (LIFO) credit 16 1 18 Gross margin $ 7,825 $ 7,191 $ 6,792 As a percent of sales 39.3% 38.3% 37.5% Costs associated with the Companys 13 store merchandise distribution centers were reclassified from SG&A expenses into cost of goods sold in the fourth quarter of 2006 and are reflected as such for all periods presented to better reflect logistics costs associated with the Companys high percentage of private brand merchandise. As a percent of sales, gross margin improved 100 basis points in 2006, on top of an 80 basis point improvement in 2005. The continued improvement in gross margin reflects continued strength in the performance of the Companys private brands, ongoing improvement in inventory management, including better flow of seasonal goods resulting in lower markdowns, and a larger contribution to sales from higher margin merchandise divisions. The higher LIFO credit in 2006 was the result of favorable costing, coupled with higher inventory levels. Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 SG&A expenses $ 5,521 $ 5,227 $ 5,135 As a percent of sales 27.7% 27.8% 28.4% In order to provide more clarity on the impact of growth initiatives, depreciation and amortization, as well as pre opening expenses, have been presented as separate components of operating expenses. Accordingly, these expenses are not included in the table above, but are discussed under separate headings below. SG&A expenses improved by 10 basis points in 2006 to 27.7% of sales, on top of a 60 basis point improvement in 2005. As a percentage of sales, advertising costs increased 30 basis points, while total retirement related benefit plan expenses decreased 30 basis points. Increased advertising expenses included costs related to the March 2006 virtual store at One Times Square in New York City, which showcased an exclusive assortment of the Companys private and exclusive brands, as well as marketing costs related to the Companys fifth annual exclusive retail sponsorship of the Academy Awards and retail sponsorships of the Teen Choice Awards and the MTV Video Music Awards. The decrease in retirement related benefit plan expenses was driven by the $60 million decrease in qualified pension plan expense, which resulted from strong investment returns on the plans assets. See a further discussion of the pension expense beginning on page 34. SG&A expenses for 2006 included $26 million related to expensing stock options in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). Total SG&A expense dollars increased 5.6% in 2006, driven by marketing and store staffing expenditures made to support a successful holiday season, operating costs for the 28 new stores added during the year, as well as incremental operating expenses related to the 53rd week of 2006, which were approximately $65 million. SG&A expenses improved by 60 basis points in 2005, with savings driven by efficiencies from changes in the department store staffing model and efficiencies in the Direct channel. While expenditures for advertising were virtually flat with 2004, the Company shifted a portion of the marketing dollars spent in 2005 from promotional 18 Table of Contents advertising to elevating the branding message of both JCPenney and the Companys private brands. SG&A expenses for 2005 included $32 million, or about $0.08 per share, related to expensing employee stock options, which started in the first quarter of 2005 upon the early adoption of SFAS No. 123R. 2005 SG&A expenses also reflected a previously disclosed one time credit of $13 million recorded in the third quarter related to the Companys share of expected proceeds from the Visa Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litigation settlement, which was essentially offset by hurricane related costs, net of probable insurance recoveries. Depreciation and Amortization Expenses As expected with the accelerated store growth and investments in improving existing stores, depreciation and amortization expenses increased to $389 million in 2006, compared to $372 million in 2005 and $359 million in 2004. As a percentage of sales, depreciation and amortization expenses were consistent from year to year at approximately 2%. Pre Opening Expense Pre opening expense includes costs such as advertising, hiring and training costs for new associates, processing and stocking initial merchandise inventory and rental costs. With the launch of the Companys accelerated store growth strategy in 2006, pre opening expense increased to $27 million in 2006, compared to $15 million and $11 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company opened 28, 18 and 14 new stores, in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Real Estate and Other (Income)/Expense ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Real estate activities $ (37 ) $ (39 ) $ (30 ) Net gains from sale of real estate (8 ) (27 ) (8 ) Asset impairments 2 7 12 PVOL and other unit closing costs 2 5 7 Management transition costs 7 29 Other 2 Total $ (34 ) $ (54 ) $ 12 Real estate and other consists primarily of ongoing operating income from the Companys real estate subsidiaries. In addition, net gains were recorded from the sale of facilities and real estate that are no longer used in Company operations and investments in real estate partnerships. For 2005, approximately half of the gain from the sale of real estate was from the sale of a vacant merchandise processing facility that was made obsolete by the centralized network of store distribution centers put in place by mid 2003. Impairments relate primarily to department stores and are the result of the Companys ongoing process of evaluating the productivity of its asset base, as described under Valuation of Long Lived Assets on page 33. PVOL represents the present value of operating lease obligations on closed units. In addition, in 2006 and 2004, the Company recorded charges of $7 million and $29 million, respectively, associated with senior management transition. Operating Income ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Operating income(1) $ 1,922 $ 1,631 $ 1,275 As a percent of sales 9.7% 8.7% 7.0% (1) See definition of Operating Income on page 13. Operating income improved for the sixth straight year in 2006, increasing 17.8%, or 100 basis points as a percent of sales, driven by sales gains and continued improvement in gross margin. This reflects the ongoing significant improvements the Company has made in merchandise assortments, as well as further refinements to the Companys planning and allocation systems to ensure that the merchandise is in the right place at the right time. Operating 19 Table of Contents income is the key measurement on which management evaluates the financial performance of the Companys retail operations. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense totaled $130 million, $169 million and $223 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Net interest expense consists primarily of interest expense on long term debt, net of interest income earned on cash and short term investments. Net interest expense in 2006 primarily benefited from higher short term interest rates on cash and short term investment balances. The weighted average interest rate on long term debt has remained relatively constant at 7.8%, 7.8% and 7.7% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Interest income earned on short term investments increased in 2006 to an average annual interest rate of 5.0%, compared to 3.2% in 2005 and 1.5% in 2004. Total debt was reduced by $2.14 billion as part of the Companys debt reduction programs initiated in 2004 and completed by the end of the second quarter of 2005. For 2004, net interest expense of $95 million was allocated to the operating results of Eckerd and recorded as discontinued operations. Bond Premiums and Unamortized Costs During 2005 and 2004, the Company incurred $18 million and $47 million, respectively, of premiums, commissions and unamortized costs related to the purchase of debt in the open market and redemption of securities under the 2005 and 2004 debt reduction programs, which are discussed on pages 28 29. These costs are reflected in Bond Premiums and Unamortized Costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. No such costs were incurred by the Company in 2006. Income Taxes The overall effective tax rates for continuing operations were 36.7%, 32.3% and 34.6% for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2006 rate was favorably impacted by the release of $32 million, or $0.14 per share, of federal income tax reserves resulting from the favorable resolution of prior year tax matters. The 2005 rate reflected a credit of $49 million, or $0.20 per share, which was principally attributable to reversing the remaining state tax net operating loss valuation allowance. Also benefiting 2005 was a one time credit of $5 million related to changes in state income tax laws. The 2007 effective income tax rate is expected to increase to approximately 38.6%. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations added $0.08 per share to net income in 2006, principally related to positive variances on tax reserves that had been provided for in connection with the sale of previously owned businesses. For 2005, discontinued operations added $0.43 per share to net income, while in 2004, discontinued operations resulted in a charge of $0.44 per share. The 2005 credit was principally related to favorable resolution of certain tax matters associated with the Companys former Eckerd drugstore operations, and the 2004 charge resulted primarily from the loss on the sale of Eckerd combined with Eckerd operating losses to the date of sale. Lojas Renner S.A. On July 5, 2005, the Companys indirect wholly owned subsidiary, J. C. Penney Brazil, Inc., closed on the sale of its shares of Lojas Renner S. A. (Renner), a Brazilian department store chain, through a public stock offering registered in Brazil. The Company generated cash proceeds of $283 million from the sale of its interest in Renner. After taxes and transaction costs, net proceeds approximated $260 million. Proceeds from the sale were used for common stock repurchases, which are more fully discussed under Equity and Debt Restructuring on pages 28 29. Including an $8 million credit related to taxes that was recorded in 2006, the sale resulted in a cumulative pre tax gain of $26 million and an after tax gain of $1 million. The relatively high tax cost is largely due to the tax basis of the Companys investment in Renner being lower than its book basis as a result of accounting for the investment under the cost method for tax purposes. Included in the pre tax gain on the sale was $83 million of foreign currency translation losses that had accumulated since the Company acquired its controlling interest in Renner. Eckerd Drugstores On July 31, 2004, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries closed on the sale of its Eckerd drugstore operations to the Jean Coutu Group (PJC) Inc. (Coutu) and CVS Corporation and CVS Pharmacy, Inc. and received net cash 20 Table of Contents proceeds of approximately $3.5 billion. Proceeds from the sale were used for common stock repurchases and debt reduction, which are more fully discussed under Equity and Debt Restructuring on pages 28 29. During 2006, the Company recorded an after tax credit of $4 million related to the Eckerd discontinued operations, which was primarily related to taxes. Through 2006, the cumulative loss on the sale was $715 million pre tax, or $1,326 million on an after tax basis. The relatively high tax cost is a result of the tax basis of Eckerd being lower than its book basis because the Companys previous drugstore acquisitions were largely tax free transactions. Of the total after tax loss on the sale, $108 million was recorded in 2004 to reflect revised estimates of certain post closing adjustments and resulting sales proceeds, and $1,325 million was recorded in 2003 to reflect Eckerd at its estimated fair value less costs to sell. These charges were partially offset by an after tax credit of $103 million recorded in 2005, which was primarily related to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters, as well as a reduction of the taxes payable on the sale of Eckerd due to adjustments in Eckerds tax basis. Upon closing on the sale of Eckerd on July 31, 2004, the Company established reserves for estimated transaction costs and post closing adjustments. Certain of these reserves involved significant judgment and actual costs incurred over time could vary from these estimates. The more significant remaining estimates relate to the costs to exit the Colorado and New Mexico markets and environmental indemnifications. Management continues to review and update the remaining reserves on a quarterly basis and believes that the overall reserves, as adjusted, are adequate as of February 3, 2007 and consistent with original estimates. Cash payments for the Eckerd related reserves are included in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as Cash Paid for Discontinued Operations, with tax payments included in operating cash flows and all other payments included in investing cash flows. Mexico Department Stores In November 2003, the Company closed on the sale of its six Mexico department stores and recorded a loss of $14 million, net of a $27 million tax benefit. In 2005 and 2004, the Company recognized after tax gains of $5 million and $4 million, respectively, related to reserve adjustments and additional tax benefits realized. Direct Marketing Services In 2006, 2005 and 2004, after tax gains of $7 million, $3 million and $1 million, respectively, were recorded related to the sale of J. C. Penney Direct Marketing Services, Inc.s assets due to favorable resolution of certain past tax issues, tax regulation changes and tax audits. The Companys financial statements, accompanying notes and other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10 K reflect these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Financial Condition The strength of the Companys financial condition is primarily dependent on the competitiveness of its customer value proposition and the level of operating performance relative to the capital resources invested in the business. Therefore, managements successful execution of the Long Range Plan will continue to be the key driver of the Companys consistent operating performance improvement, earnings per share growth, market valuation and overall financial condition. Financial Goals The Companys financial strategy will continue to focus on opportunities to deliver value to stockholders, strengthen the financial position and improve the credit rating profile. Long range planning targets have been established related to operating financial goals, key financial metrics, cash flow, credit ratings, dividends and earnings per share growth, which are discussed below. At the April 2006 Analyst Meeting, management provided updated profitability targets to the original 2005 to 2009 Long Range Plan. Specific long range operating financial objectives include generating annual low single digit comparable department store sales increases and mid single digit Direct sales increases, with total sales increasing mid single digits, continued improvement in annual gross margin and leveraging of SG&A expenses, with the objective of reaching an operating income target of 10.0% to 10.5% of sales in 2009, and achieving 16% annual 21 Table of Contents EPS growth through 2009. With the 2006 operating income margin at 9.7%, the Companys 2006 operating performance came close to achieving in just two years the planned performance levels in its original 2005 2009 Long Range Plan. Management will communicate operating performance targets for a new 2007 to 2011 Long Range Plan at its April 2007 Analyst Meeting. Going forward, the growth drivers for operating income will continue to be new store growth, sales productivity improvements, continued improvements in the gross margin rate and SG&A leverage. The Companys progress toward achieving its operating financial goals could be impacted by various risks, which are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, beginning on page 4, and the cautionary statement regarding forward looking information on page 39. The Company expects cash flow from operating activities (operating cash flow) to increase each year, resulting principally from higher net income. Operating cash flow is targeted to exceed planned capital spending levels, in order to provide financial flexibility and ongoing support for the Long Range Plan. Continued strong operating performance, increasing operating cash flows and a strengthening capital structure should enable the Company to achieve competitive investment grade credit ratings, allowing access to the commercial paper market, thereby enhancing the Companys financial flexibility. The goal of the Companys dividend policy is to deliver competitive value to stockholders. The Companys Board of Directors (Board) increased the cash dividends to stockholders by 44% in 2006 and a plan to increase the cash dividend by 11% was approved by the Board for 2007. 2006 Key Financial Metrics The Companys 2006 performance represented further progress toward industry leadership, resulting from continued improvement in operating results and the completion of a $750 million stock repurchase program. Over the past several years, the Companys returns on capital have significantly improved, and its financial leverage has been dramatically reduced. The Companys operating performance in 2006 was well ahead of schedule in achieving the objectives established in the original 2005 2009 Long Range Plan. Management and the investment community utilize these financial metrics to assess the Companys financial health and benchmark against planned targets as well as peers in the retail industry. The Companys calculations of these metrics are based on components of the GAAP financial statements and may vary from those of other companies, potentially limiting comparability. These measures are not considered GAAP measures, but management believes they provide the most comprehensive perspective of the Companys capital productivity and financial leverage. Return on Capital Metrics In 2006, the Companys return on stockholders equity (ROE) and return on invested capital (ROIC) improved significantly. In 2006, the Company achieved a 28.3% ROE, representing a 31% improvement since 2000. The Company calculates ROE as income from continuing operations divided by beginning of year stockholders equity. The Company uses an 11% ROIC as its target, or hurdle, rate for new capital investments, which represents the Companys blended (debt and equity) long term cost of capital estimate. In 2006, the Company exceeded this level with a ROIC of 17.4%. The Company calculates ROIC as income from continuing operations plus after tax interest expense on long term debt divided by the sum of beginning of year stockholders equity and long term debt, including current maturities. Beginning in 2007, return metrics will reflect the 2006 reduction to equity resulting from a change in pension accounting rules (discussed in Note 1 on pages F 12 and F 13). Notwithstanding the equity adjustment, further improvements in both ROE and ROIC are expected in future years with continued earnings growth. Debt Percent to Total Capital After significant improvement during the 2001 to 2005 turnaround period, the Companys capital structure as of year end 2006 remains competitive. As of year end 2006, the Companys debt percent to total capital improved to a level of 44.5%, compared to 46.4% and 44.7% in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The improvement in 2006 was primarily a result of higher net income. No material changes in long term debt occurred during 2006. Credit Agreement Covenants Under the Companys 2005 Credit Agreement, discussed on page 27, the Company is required to satisfy a leverage ratio covenant and a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant, which are discussed in Note 10. The leverage ratio 22 Table of Contents continued to improve during 2006 to a level of 1.5 to 1.0, and remained in compliance with the 2005 Credit Agreement covenant requirement of no more than 3.0 to 1.0. The fixed charge coverage ratio also improved during 2006 to a level of 6.9 to 1.0, and remained in compliance with the 2005 Credit Agreement covenant requirement of at least 3.2 to 1.0. Liquidity and Capital Resources Over the 2000 to 2006 period, the Companys liquidity and capital resources have strengthened significantly and created an increased level of financial flexibility to support the Companys Long Range Plan. The Company manages its capital structure to ensure financial flexibility and access to capital, at a competitive cost, necessary to support the Long Range Plan. Management considers all on and off balance sheet debt in evaluating the Companys overall liquidity position and capital structure. See the discussion of off balance sheet arrangements on pages 27 28 and the detailed disclosure regarding operating leases and their off balance sheet present value in Note 16. Cash and Short Term Investments At year end 2006, the Company had approximately $2.7 billion of cash and short term investments, which represented nearly 80% of its $3.4 billion of outstanding long term debt, including current maturities. Cash and short term investments included restricted short term investment balances of $58 million as of February 3, 2007, pledged as collateral for a portion of casualty insurance program liabilities. In 2006, the cash and short term investment balance was reduced by the completion of a $750 million common stock repurchase program. In addition to cash and short term investments, the Companys liquidity position includes a five year $1.2 billion revolving credit facility that was put in place in April 2005 (2005 Credit Agreement). The 2005 Credit Agreement is unsecured, and all collateral securing the previously existing $1.5 billion credit facility has been released. The dollar amount of the credit facility was reduced due to the sale of Eckerd. For further discussion of the credit facility, see page 27. The Companys liquidity is enhanced by the fact that the current debt portfolio and material lease agreements contain no provisions that could trigger acceleration of payments or collateral support in the event of adverse changes in the Companys financial condition. Cash Flows The following is a summary of the Companys cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for both continuing and discontinued operations: ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Net cash provided by/(used in): Continuing operations: Operating activities(1) $ 1,255 $ 1,337 $ 1,111 Investing activities (752 ) (221 ) 4,302 Financing activities (751 ) (2,652 ) (2,660 ) Discontinued operations: Operating activities 11 82 (792 )(2) Investing activities (32 ) (187 ) (263 ) Financing activities 8 (13 ) Net (decrease)/increase in cash and short term investments $ (269 ) $ (1,633 ) $ 1,685 (1) Includes $300 million discretionary cash contributions to the Companys qualified pension plan in both 2006 and 2004. The approximately $110 million tax benefit related to the 2006 contribution will not be realized until fiscal 2007; the 2004 contribution was $190 million after tax. No contribution to the Companys qualified pension plan was made in 2005 due to the plans well funded status and Internal Revenue Service limitations on tax deductible contributions. (2) Includes $822 million of income taxes paid related to the sale of Eckerd. Significantly improved operating performance over the past few years has provided the financial flexibility to increase capital expenditures for new store growth, store renewals and updates, with additional liquidity allowing the Company to increase funding to its qualified pension plan. 23 Table of Contents Cash Flow from Operating Activities Continuing Operations The Companys operations are seasonal in nature, with the business depending to a great extent on the last quarter of the year when a significant portion of the sales, profits and positive operating cash flows are realized. Cash requirements are highest in the third quarter as the Company builds inventory levels in preparation for the holiday season. In both 2006 and 2004, the Company made $300 million discretionary contributions to its qualified pension plan. Based on market conditions, the resulting well funded status of the pension plan and Internal Revenue Service rules limiting tax deductible contributions, the Company did not make a discretionary pension contribution to its qualified pension plan in 2005. Additionally, due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R in 2005, $39 million and $43 million, respectively, of excess tax benefits from stock options exercised are reflected in cash flows from financing activities for 2006 and 2005, whereas for 2004, $76 million of excess tax benefits from stock options exercised were reflected in cash flows from operating activities. Cash Flow from Investing Activities Continuing Operations Capital expenditures, including capitalized software costs, were $772 million, $535 million and $398 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase was principally for new off mall stores, store renewals and modernizations and costs related to new point of sale technology at each of the Companys 35,000 registers. During 2006, the Company opened 28 new stores, 10 of which were store relocations, and closed four stores. The following provides a breakdown of capital expenditures: ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 New and relocated stores $ 365 $ 173 $ 119 Store renewals and updates 266 204 185 Technology 110 110 69 Other 31 48 25 Total $ 772 $ 535 $ 398 Consistent with the Long Range Plan, new store growth is planned to further accelerate in 2007. Management expects 2007 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.2 billion. Approximately 55% of the capital spending will relate to new or relocated stores, 30% to store renewals and updates, 10% to technology, and 5% to other routine projects. The Company currently plans to open 50 new and relocated stores in 2007, of which over 80% are expected to be off mall. Incorporating relocations and store closures, net square footage growth is expected to increase approximately 3%. Proceeds from the sale of real estate assets were $20 million for 2006, compared to $31 million and $34 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Cash Flow from Financing Activities Continuing Operations For 2006, cash payments for long term debt, including capital leases, totaled $21 million. During 2005, such payments totaled $474 million and are discussed further under Equity and Debt Restructuring on pages 28 29. During 2006, the Company returned approximately $900 million to stockholders through common stock repurchases and dividend payments. The Company repurchased 11.3 million shares of common stock for $750 million during 2006. Common stock was retired on the same day it was repurchased, and the related cash settlements were completed on the third business day following the repurchase. JCPenney raised the quarterly dividend on its common stock to $0.18 per share beginning with the May 1, 2006 dividend. The Company paid quarterly dividends of $0.125 per share in 2005 and 2004. The Board reviews the dividend policy and rate on a quarterly basis, taking into consideration the overall financial and strategic outlook for the Company, earnings, liquidity and cash flow projections, as well as competitive factors. Based on the current outlook for earnings, cash flow and liquidity, in February 2007, the Board approved a plan to increase the quarterly dividend by 11%, from $0.18 per share to $0.20 per share, to be effective with the dividend to be paid on May 1, 2007. Prior to August 26, 2004, the Company also paid semi annual dividends on its Series B ESOP Convertible 24 Table of Contents Preferred Stock at an annual rate of $2.37 per common share equivalent. All outstanding shares of Series B ESOP Convertible Preferred Stock were converted to common shares on August 26, 2004. Net proceeds from the exercise of stock options were $135 million in 2006, compared to $162 million in 2005 and $248 million in 2004. Due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R in 2005, $39 million and $43 million, respectively, of excess tax benefits from stock options exercised are reflected in cash flows from financing activities for 2006 and 2005, whereas for 2004, $76 million of excess tax benefits from stock options exercised were reflected in cash flows from operating activities. Cash Flow and Financing Outlook In 2007, the Companys financing strategy will continue to focus on opportunities to deliver value to stockholders, strengthen the financial position and improve the credit profile. The Companys strengthened financial position provides an increased level of financial flexibility to support the strategic growth objectives of the Long Range Plan. Consistent with the Companys goal of delivering value to stockholders, in February 2007, the Board approved a plan to increase the quarterly dividend by 11%, from $0.18 per share to $0.20 per share, to be effective with the dividend to be paid on May 1, 2007. On March 29, 2007, the Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share to be paid on May 1, 2007. In addition, the Board authorized a new $400 million common stock repurchase program, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2007 and will be funded by a portion of the cash proceeds and tax benefits from associate stock option exercises and cash and short term investment balances. In accordance with its financing strategy, the Company expects to maintain its strong liquidity position in 2007. The Company expects operating cash flow to increase each year, resulting principally from higher net income. Operating cash flow is targeted to exceed planned capital spending levels, which should provide financial flexibility and ongoing support for the Long Range Plan. Until all of the Companys credit ratings improve to competitive investment grade levels, access to the capital markets for cash needs will retain an element of uncertainty. As such, management intends to maintain sufficient cash investment levels to ensure support for operational business needs, strategic initiatives, long term debt maturities, dividends and contingency items, such as the opportunistic purchase of selected real estate properties attributable to consolidation within the retail industry. The Company does not expect to borrow under its credit facility except to support ongoing letters of credit. The Company has $425 million of notes scheduled to mature in 2007, and an additional $200 million scheduled to mature in fiscal 2008. In accordance with its long term financing strategy, the Company manages its financial position on a multi year basis and may access the capital markets opportunistically. The Companys cash flows may be impacted by many factors, including the competitive conditions in the retail industry, the effects of the economic environment and consumer confidence levels. Based on the nature of the Companys business, management considers the above factors to be normal business risks. Inventory Total LIFO inventory was $3,400 million at the end of 2006 compared with $3,210 million at the end of 2005. FIFO inventory was $3,408 million at the end of 2006, which increased 5.4% when compared to last years $3,234 million, primarily as a result of new store openings in 2006 and new stores planned for the first quarter of 2007. After an effective transition from fall and holiday assortments, the Company was well positioned at the end of 2006 with fresh merchandise for the spring season and less clearance merchandise than the prior year. Inventory also reflected a good balance between fashion and basic merchandise. With new systems and its network of store distribution centers, the Company has continued to enhance its ability to allocate and flow merchandise to stores in season by recognizing sales trends earlier and accelerating receipts, replenishing individual stores based on rates of sale and consistently providing high in stock levels in basics and advertised items. This continued improvement of inventory management has helped to drive more profitable sales and improvements in inventory turnover, which for 2006, 2005 and 2004 was 3.33, 3.28 and 3.21, respectively. With the elimination of global trade quotas on apparel and textiles, the Company expects to concentrate production of private brand merchandise in fewer countries and with fewer manufacturers. On an ongoing basis, the Company develops contingency plans to provide for alternate sources for product in order to ensure uninterrupted access to 25 Table of Contents merchandise. Cost reductions will allow the Company to invest in higher quality merchandise and thereby improve the value proposition to the Companys target customer. Contractual Obligations and Commitments Aggregated information about the Companys obligations and commitments to make future contractual payments, such as debt and lease agreements, and contingent commitments as of February 3, 2007 is presented in the following table. After ($ in millions) Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 5 years Recorded contractual obligations: Long term debt, including current maturities and capital leases $ 3,444 $ 434 $ 203 $ $ 506 $ $ 2,301 Trade payables 1,366 1,366 Contributions to non qualified supplemental retirement and postretirement medical plans(1) 425 74 76 79 27 26 143 $ 5,235 $ 1,874 $ 279 $ 79 $ 533 $ 26 $ 2,444 Unrecorded contractual obligations: Interest payments on long term debt and capital leases(2) $ 5,822 $ 253 $ 222 $ 218 $ 198 $ 178 $ 4,753 Operating leases(3) 1,948 213 197 170 137 112 1,119 Standby and import letters of credit(4) 122 122 Surety bonds(5) 56 56 Contractual obligations(6) 317 208 97 11 1 Guarantees(7) 42 8 3 31 $ 8,307 $ 860 $ 516 $ 402 $ 335 $ 290 $ 5,904 Total $ 13,542 $ 2,734 $ 795 $ 481 $ 868 $ 316 $ 8,348 (1) Represents expected payments through 2016. Based on the accounting rules for retirement and postretirement benefit plans, the liabilities reflected in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets differ from these estimated future payments. See Note 17. (2) The 2007 interest payments include $84 million that is reflected in Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet at February 3, 2007. See Note 7. (3) Represents future minimum lease payments for non cancelable operating leases, including renewals determined to be reasonably assured. (4) Standby letters of credit ($116 million) are issued as collateral to a third party administrator for self insured workers compensation and general liability claims. The remaining $6 million are outstanding import letters of credit. (5) Surety bonds are primarily for previously incurred and expensed obligations related to workers compensation and general liability claims. (6) Consists primarily of (a) minimum purchase requirements for exclusive merchandise and fixtures; (b) royalty obligations and (c) minimum obligations for professional services, energy services, software maintenance and network services. (7) Includes (a) $11 million for certain personal property leases assumed by the purchasers of Eckerd; (b) $11 million on loans related to a real estate investment trust and (c) $20 million related to a third party reinsurance guarantee. The Company is predominantly engaged in the retailing business of buying and selling apparel, accessories and home merchandise. In the normal course of business, the Company issues purchase orders to vendors/suppliers for merchandise inventory to meet customer demand for fashion, seasonal and basic merchandise. The Companys purchase orders are not unconditional commitments, but rather represent executory contracts requiring performance by vendors/suppliers, including delivery of the merchandise prior to a specified cancellation date and meeting product specifications and other requirements. Failure to meet agreed upon terms and conditions may result in the 26 Table of Contents cancellation of the order. Accordingly, the table above excludes outstanding purchase orders for merchandise inventory that has not been shipped. Under the terms of the purchase orders, merchandise is purchased on a Free on Board (F.O.B.) shipping point basis, which means ownership of the merchandise passes to the Company upon shipment. As a result, the cost of merchandise shipped but not received by the Company as of year end (in transit merchandise) is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Merchandise Inventory with a corresponding offset in Trade Payables. As of February 3, 2007, the Company had approximately $392 million of domestic and foreign in transit merchandise, which together with trade payables for merchandise already received, is reflected in the table above. Additionally, the Company issues letters of credit for selected merchandise inventory sourced overseas, which are also included in the previous table. Credit Agreement The Company, JCP and J. C. Penney Purchasing Corporation are parties to a five year $1.2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (2005 Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of lenders with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. The 2005 Credit Agreement is available for general corporate purposes, including the issuance of letters of credit. Pricing is tiered based on JCPs senior unsecured long term debt ratings by Moodys and Standard & Poors. JCPs obligations under the 2005 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company. No borrowings, other than the issuance of trade and standby letters of credit, which totaled $122 million as of the end of 2006, have been made under this facility. The 2005 Credit Agreement includes two financial leverage metric covenants, which are discussed in Note 10. Credit Ratings Improvements in the Companys operating performance and financial metrics led to its long term debt credit rating being raised to investment grade level by Fitch in 2005 and by Moodys and Standard & Poors in early 2006. Restoring competitive investment grade credit ratings, consistent with retail industry leaders, continues to be a financial goal for the Company. As of March 19, 2007, the Companys credit ratings and outlook were as follows: Long Term Debt Outlook Moodys Investors Service, Inc. Baa3 Positive Standard & Poors Ratings Services BBB Stable Fitch Ratings BBB Stable During the first quarter of 2006, both Moodys and Standard & Poors raised the Companys credit ratings to investment grade. In February 2006, Moodys raised its senior unsecured credit rating for the Company from Ba1 to an investment grade rating of Baa3. In April 2006, Standard & Poors raised its credit rating on the Companys long term corporate credit and senior unsecured debt from BB+ to an investment grade rating of BBB . In October 2006, Fitch raised its credit rating on the Companys senior unsecured notes and debentures and its $1.2 billion 2005 Credit Agreement from BBB to BBB, both investment grade credit ratings. In December 2006, Moodys raised its outlook on the Companys long term debt rating from Stable to Positive. Going forward, the Company expects that the rating agencies will continue to focus on operating performance consistency, earnings growth and financial leverage as key factors in any ratings decisions. Indenture Covenant The Company has an indenture covering approximately $255 million of long term debt that contains a financial covenant requiring the Company to have a minimum of 200% net tangible assets to senior funded indebtedness (as defined in the indenture). This indenture permits the Company to issue additional long term debt if it is in compliance with the covenant. As of year end 2006, the Companys percent of net tangible assets to senior funded indebtedness was 292%. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than operating leases, which are included in the Contractual Obligations and Commitments table on page 26, the Company does not have any off balance sheet financing. The Company has not created, and is not party to, any 27 Table of Contents special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating its business. As of February 3, 2007, the Company had guarantees of approximately $11 million for certain personal property leases assumed by the purchasers of Eckerd, which were previously reported as operating leases. Currently, management does not believe that any potential financial exposure related to these guarantees would have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. JCP, through JCP Realty, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, has investments in 14 partnerships that own regional mall properties, six as general partner and eight as limited partner. JCPs potential exposure to risk is greater in partnerships in which it is a general partner. Mortgages on the six general partnerships total approximately $353 million; however, the estimated market value of the underlying properties is approximately $842 million. These mortgages are non recourse to JCP, so any financial exposure is minimal. In addition, JCP Realty, Inc. has guaranteed loans totaling approximately $11 million related to an investment in a real estate investment trust. The estimated market value of the underlying properties significantly exceeds the outstanding mortgage loans, and the loan guarantee to market value ratio is less than 3% as of February 3, 2007. In the event of possible default, the creditors would recover first from the proceeds of the sale of the properties, next from the general partner, then from other guarantors before JCPs guarantee would be invoked. As a result, management does not believe that any potential financial exposure related to this guarantee would have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. As part of the 2001 sale of the assets of the Companys Direct Marketing Services subsidiary, JCP signed a guarantee agreement with a maximum exposure of $20 million. Any potential claims or losses are first recovered from established reserves, then from the purchaser and finally from any state insurance guarantee fund before JCPs guarantee would be invoked. As a result, management does not believe that any potential exposure would have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company does not have any additional arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements. Equity and Debt Restructuring In order to enhance stockholder value, strengthen the Companys capital structure and improve its credit rating profile, since 2004, the Company has implemented programs to repurchase common stock, reduce debt and redeem all outstanding shares of Series B ESOP Convertible Preferred Stock (Preferred Stock). In order to fund these programs, the Company used the $3.5 billion in net cash proceeds from the sale of the Eckerd drugstore operations, $260 million in net cash proceeds from the sale of Renner stock, cash proceeds and tax benefits from the exercise of employee stock options and existing cash and short term investment balances. Stock Repurchases During the 2004 to 2006 period, the Company purchased a combined $4.9 billion of its common stock through open market transactions as follows: (in millions) Shares Cost(1) 2004 50.1 $ 1,951 2005 44.2 2,199 2006 11.3 750 Total 105.6 $ 4,900 (1) Excludes commissions. Of the total repurchases, the Companys Board authorized $3.0 billion in 2004, $1.15 billion in 2005 and $750 million in 2006. Debt Reduction The Companys debt reduction programs, which were completed by the end of the second quarter of 2005, consisted of approximately $2.14 billion of debt reductions. 28 Table of Contents The Companys debt retirements included $250 million of open market debt repurchases in the first half of 2005, the payment of $193 million of long term debt at the scheduled maturity date in May 2005 and 2004 transactions that consisted of $650 million of debt converted to common stock, $822 million of cash payments and the termination of the $221 million Eckerd securitized receivables program. The Company incurred pre tax charges of $18 million and $47 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to these early debt retirements. Series B Convertible Preferred Stock Redemption On August 26, 2004, the Company redeemed, through conversion to common stock, all of its outstanding shares of Preferred Stock. All of these shares were held by the Companys Savings, Profit Sharing and Stock Ownership Plan, a 401(k) savings plan. Each holder of Preferred Stock received 20 equivalent shares of JCPenney common stock for each share of Preferred Stock in their Savings Plan account in accordance with the original terms of the Preferred Stock. Preferred Stock shares, which were included in the diluted earnings per share calculation as appropriate, were converted into approximately nine million common stock shares. Annual dividend savings approximated $11 million after tax. Risk Management Management is committed to proactively managing enterprise risks as the strategies and initiatives of the Long Range Plan are executed in order to maximize enterprise value (defined as the combined capital markets value of the Companys debt and equity) to investors. The success to date in implementing the 2005 2009 Long Range Plan has resulted in strategic and operational initiatives that have associated and ever changing performance opportunities, both upside and downside. Over the past six years, the Companys enterprise value increased significantly as its portfolio of risks was managed effectively. Management defines risk as the potential deviation from planned operating results that may have a negative impact on investor enterprise value in the short or long term. The deviation can arise from inadequate or ineffective internal processes or systems, external events or Company personnel. The Company is subject to risks inherent in operating a multi channel retailing organization. For a detailed discussion on risks and uncertainties, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, beginning on page 4 and the cautionary statement regarding forward looking information on page 39. The key driver in managing strategic and operating risks in order to maximize enterprise value is consistent execution of the Long Range Plan strategies and initiatives. Managing strategic and operating risks provides opportunities, both to capitalize on positive events and mitigate negative circumstances. Risk Mitigating Factors The Company conducts extensive customer research. During 2006, the Company began utilizing an online survey to accumulate customer feedback on the store shopping experience. Information has been obtained in such areas as associate interactions with customers, availability of associates, attractiveness of displays and fixtures, overall store cleanliness and pricing and signing accuracy. The results are used by stores to focus efforts on improvements that will better meet their customers needs. The Company also regularly measures customer satisfaction through a customer scorecard, which benchmarks customer perceptions against key competitors. Exit surveys are regularly conducted to better understand customer shopping habits and whether they are finding what they want at JCPenney. In addition, management continues to focus on measuring marketing productivity by utilizing post event analyses and other measurement tools. The Company has resources dedicated to monitoring the external environment, which includes retail competitors, retail industry and consumer trends, as well as the current economic outlook. The deeper the Companys understanding is of competitors strategies, performance, and strengths and weaknesses, the better it can develop appropriate responses to compete more effectively, enhance the Companys competitive position, and achieve and sustain top quartile performance. Management conducts ongoing strategic geographic market research, including demographic and regional economic trends, prior to making a decision to enter or relocate into a particular geographic area. The Company conducts ongoing benchmarking of key metrics for all geographic markets, including market share, sales growth, sales per square foot, and competitor and population trends. 29 Table of Contents Product development and sourcing are critical to the success of the private brand business. Another key Company initiative is reducing private brand cycle time the time it takes from concept until the merchandise hits the selling floor. With the Companys most recent private brand launches, management has been able to demonstrate that it can significantly reduce the cycle time. The Companys substantial sourcing abilities should enable it to continue to reduce the product lead times and offer customers more relevant and timely merchandise. Management has established processes to optimize order flow by country and to reduce the cycle time from the design stage to having the merchandise available for sale to customers. The Company has a diversified supplier base, both domestic and foreign, and is not dependent to any significant degree on any single supplier. Additionally, the Company has business continuity plans in place for all merchandise distribution centers that would provide rerouting of merchandise allocations to have uninterrupted flow of merchandise to both stores and direct to customers. In order to ensure that associates have the tools and skills needed to support the Companys strategies and initiatives, senior management has been developing new training programs and has been involved in delivering these programs to associates. This includes Retail Academy, a week long program for high potential associates focused on retail strategy and team building, and WINNING TOGETHER Leading Together, a course led by the Companys Chief Executive Officer focused on improving leadership skills for the Companys most senior 500 managers. The Company seeks to minimize operational risk associated with communication and information systems through the development of back up systems and emergency plans. The Company has disaster prevention and recovery plans in place should events occur that could interrupt operations. Ongoing assessment and testing is being conducted to minimize current and future risk. There is a process in place to provide regular associate training, operating instructions and site visits to help limit operational defects or mistakes. The Company has a number of integrated programs in place to mitigate the financial impact from property losses or third party liability claims. Each year, management reviews the level of risk that will be retained by the Company and the portion of risk that will be supported by conventional insurance contracts. The Companys strong financial profile, business continuity plans, and third party insurance where appropriate, mitigate the risk that any single risk event would have a material impact on the Companys financial position or operations. As part of its ongoing planning process, management measures key risks in terms of the potential impact on enterprise market value, operating performance, key financial metrics, and the Companys overall financial condition. This process utilizes scenario analysis and stress testing of risks that can cause variation from planned operating results and impact the Companys enterprise value. Until such time as the Company has steady and reliable access to commercial paper, it plans to maintain sufficient cash investment levels to cover peak seasonal inventory needs and contingencies. The Company also recognizes that to achieve its strategies, it must maintain its reputation among many constituents customers, suppliers, investors and regulators, as well as the general public for business practices of the highest ethical quality. Attention to integrity and reputation has always been a key aspect of the Companys practices and maintenance of reputation is the responsibility of everyone in the organization. The Company supports this individual responsibility in many ways, including a code of ethics, training, policies, reporting mechanisms and oversight through the Companys Legal Compliance and Business Ethics Committee, which is discussed below. Risk Management Framework The Company has an enterprise wide risk management framework in place to identify, measure and manage risks. The Companys organizational structure, both at the Board and management levels, plays a critical role in maintaining an effective overall risk management process, as highlighted by the risk management and monitoring processes described below. Independent Oversight Several Board committees oversee the risk governance activities of the senior management committees. The Audit Committee is responsible for discussion of guidelines and policies governing the process by which risk assessment and management is undertaken. In addition, the Audit Committee reviews with management the systems of internal control over financial reporting that are relied upon to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with the Companys operational risk management processes. The Finance Committee 30 Table of Contents reviews the Companys overall financial plans, policies, strategies and capital structure. The Human Resources and Compensation Committee oversees senior management committees responsible for retirement and welfare plans, equity and other compensation plans. The Corporate Governance Committee monitors developments in the governance area and recommends policies and practices to the Board of Directors. Executive Board The Executive Board, comprised of the top members of senior management, meets monthly and is involved in the development of corporate strategy, monthly review of operational and financial results, progress on planned initiatives and other matters that relate to the leadership and management of the Company. The Executive Board also provides direction for managing the portfolio of risks throughout the enterprise. Legal Compliance and Business Ethics Committee (Ethics Committee) This Committee provides assistance to the Chief Ethics Officer in ensuring that the Companys legal compliance and ethics program is effective under applicable laws and regulations. The Ethics Committees responsibilities include assessing the risks of non compliance with applicable laws or regulations and of unethical conduct by associates or agents of the Company; determining how best to mitigate such risks through the promulgation and or revision of written compliance and ethics standards, including the Companys Statement of Business Ethics; and the communication of such standards through training, auditing, monitoring and other forms of checking; encouraging associates to report possible violations of Company compliance and ethics related standards. The Ethics Committee also oversees internal investigations into possible violations of law or Company policy and the discipline imposed for any violations of Company policy. The Ethics Committee also assists the Chief Ethics Officer in reporting, no less than annually, to the Board and the Audit Committee of the Board on the operation, content and effectiveness of the Companys legal compliance and ethics programs. Human Resources Committee (HRC) The HRC, which is made up of senior executives of the Company, ensures appropriate management and fiduciary responsibilities are carried out with respect to retirement and welfare plans, and manages and provides direction for equity and compensation plan strategies. Capital Appropriations Committee (CAC) The CAC, which is made up of senior executives of the Company, reviews and approves individual capital and systems projects, and ensures proper capital allocation consistent with the overall capital expenditure plan approved by the Board of Directors. Disclosure and Controls Review Committee (DCRC) and Sarbanes Oxley Compliance and Monitoring Group The DCRC is made up of senior executives of the Company, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO). The DCRC ensures that the Companys established disclosure controls and procedures and certification process are adhered to. The Company has a Sarbanes Oxley Compliance and Monitoring Group, which consists of associates dedicated full time to managing the ongoing process of monitoring and self testing key controls throughout the organization, documenting and testing significant changes to internal control over financial reporting and meeting the related reporting requirements. Independent Support Functions Internal Audit, Legal and Finance support the Companys risk management function. They operate independently of the operating divisions of the Company. As an important component of the Companys control structure, the Internal Audit department reports functionally to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Internal Audit performs reviews and completes test work to ensure that: (a) risks are appropriately identified and managed; (b) interaction with various internal governance groups, such as the legal compliance coordinators, occurs as needed; (c) significant financial, managerial and operating information is reliable and timely; (d) associates actions are in compliance with policies, standards, procedures and applicable laws and regulations; (e) resources are acquired economically, used efficiently and adequately protected; (f) quality and continuous improvement are fostered in the organizations control process; and (g) significant legislative or regulatory issues impacting the organization are recognized and addressed appropriately. Legal compliance coordinators, working with Internal Audit, are responsible for ensuring that all areas of the Company maintain effective compliance procedures. Internal Control Structure During 2006, the Company continued to focus on further tightening its overall internal control structure by having ongoing discussions between management and the Companys Audit Committee in their oversight role and discussing managements actions and programs to control and monitor the Companys major fraud risks. In 31 Table of Contents addition, Internal Audit completed a review of the Companys different whistleblower hotlines to identify ways to improve the effectiveness for associates and external stakeholders to report suspected wrongdoings and other concerns related to ethics, legal compliance, accounting complaints, loss prevention and human resources issues. The Company is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting in order to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the timely and accurate preparation of financial statements for external purposes. Since 2004, under Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, management has reported publicly on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting and has included Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting for 2006 on page 40. Additionally, the Companys external auditors are required to express an opinion on managements assessment as well as on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. KPMG LLPs report as of year end 2006 is included on page 41. Critical Accounting Policies The application of accounting policies necessarily involves judgment and, in certain instances, the use of estimates and assumptions. Different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Management believes that the accounting policies used to develop estimates that are the most critical to understanding and evaluating the Companys reported results relate to: inventory valuation under the retail method of accounting; valuation of long lived assets; estimation of reserves and valuation allowances, specifically related to closed stores, insurance, income taxes, litigation and environmental contingencies; and pension accounting. Historically, actual results have not been materially different than the estimates that are discussed below. Although the Company also has other policies considered key accounting policies, such as revenue recognition, these policies do not require management to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective. The Companys management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board and its independent auditors. The Audit Committee has reviewed the Companys disclosures relating to these policies in this MD&A. For a complete list of the Companys significant accounting policies, see Note 1, which begins on page F 7. Inventory Valuation under the Retail Method Inventories are valued primarily at the lower of cost (using the last in, first out or LIFO method) or market, determined by the retail method for department stores and store distribution centers, and standard cost, representing average vendor cost, for Direct and regional warehouses. Under the retail method, inventory is segregated into groupings of merchandise having similar characteristics and is stated at its current retail selling value. Inventory retail values are converted to a cost basis by applying specific average cost factors to each grouping of merchandise. Cost factors represent the average cost to retail ratio for each merchandise group based on the beginning of period inventory plus the current periods purchase activity, as calculated on a monthly basis, for each store location. Accordingly, a significant assumption under retail method accounting is that the inventory in each group of merchandise is similar in terms of its cost to retail relationship and has similar gross margin and turnover rates. Management monitors the content of merchandise in these groupings to ensure distortions that would have a material effect on inventory valuation do not occur. The retail method inherently requires management judgment and certain estimates that may significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost, as well as gross margin. Among others, two of the most significant estimates are permanent reductions to retail prices (markdowns) used to clear unproductive or slow moving inventory and inventory shortages (shrinkage). Permanent markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded at the point of decision, when the utility of inventory has diminished, versus the point of sale. Factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand, customer preferences, age of the merchandise and style trends. The corresponding reduction to gross margin is also recorded in the period the decision is made. Shrinkage is estimated as a percentage of sales for the period from the last inventory date to the end of the fiscal year. Physical inventories are taken at least annually for all department stores, store distribution centers, warehouses and Direct fulfillment centers on a staggered basis throughout the year, and inventory records are adjusted accordingly. The shrinkage rate from the most recent physical inventory, in combination with current events and historical experience, is used as the standard for the shrinkage accrual rate for the next inventory cycle. 32 Table of Contents To estimate the effects of inflation/deflation on ending inventory, an internal index measuring price changes from the beginning to the end of the year is calculated using merchandise cost data at the item level. Valuation of Long Lived Assets Management evaluates recoverability of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, for example, when a stores performance falls below minimum Company standards. In the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, management reviews the performance of individual stores. Underperforming stores are selected for further evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying amounts. If the evaluation, done on an undiscounted cash flow basis, indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, the potential impairment is measured as the excess of carrying value over the fair value of the impaired asset. Management estimates fair value based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate that is considered to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the Companys current business model. Additional factors are taken into consideration, such as local market conditions, operating environment, mall performance and other trends. Impairment losses totaling $2 million, $7 million and $12 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, were recorded for underperforming department stores and underutilized Direct and other facilities. If different assumptions were made or different market conditions were present, any estimated potential impairment amounts could vary from recorded amounts. Reserves and Valuation Allowances Based on an overall analysis of store performance and expected trends, management periodically evaluates the need to close underperforming stores. Reserves are established at the point of closure for the present value of any remaining operating lease obligations (PVOL), net of estimated sublease income, and at the point of decision for severance and other exit costs, as prescribed by SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. See further discussion in Note 1 on page F 13. Two key assumptions in calculating the reserve include the timeframe expected to terminate lease agreements and estimation of other related exit costs. If different assumptions were used regarding the timing and potential termination costs, the resulting reserves could vary from recorded amounts. Reserves are reviewed periodically and adjusted, when necessary. The Company records a provision for workers compensation and general liability risk based on historical experience, current claims data and independent actuarial best estimates, including incurred but not reported claims. The Company targets this provision above the midpoint of the actuarial range, and total estimated claim liability amounts are discounted using a risk free rate. Income taxes are estimated for each jurisdiction in which the Company operates. This involves assessing the current tax exposure together with temporary differences, which result from differing treatment of items for tax and book purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are provided for based on these assessments. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for recoverability based on estimated future taxable income. To the extent that recovery is deemed unlikely, a valuation allowance is recorded. During 2005, management determined that the Company will more likely than not generate sufficient income over the next several years to utilize state tax net operating losses for which a valuation allowance had been recorded. This valuation allowance was appropriately reversed. Tax reserves are provided for when the Company considers that it is probable that taxes will be due. Such reserves are evaluated and adjusted as appropriate, while taking into account the progress of audits of various taxing jurisdictions. Management does not expect the outcome of tax audits to have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. Many years of data have been incorporated into the determination of tax reserves, and the Companys estimates have historically been reasonable. The Company is involved in legal proceedings and governmental inquiries associated with employment and other matters. Reserves have been established based on managements best estimates of the Companys potential liability in these matters. These estimates have been developed in consultation with in house and outside counsel. Management does not believe that these proceedings and inquiries, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. See further discussion in Note 20. 33 Table of Contents Reserves for potential environmental liabilities related to facilities, some of which the Company no longer operates, are adjusted based on the Companys experience, as well as consultations with independent engineering firms and in house legal counsel, as appropriate. Management believes the established reserves, as adjusted, are adequate to cover estimated potential liabilities. Pension Pension Accounting JCP sponsors a non contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan (the primary pension plan), supplemental retirement plans for certain management associates and other postretirement benefit plans. Refer to Note 17 for further discussion of these plans. Effective January 1, 2007, the Company implemented certain changes to its retirement benefits, which are discussed on pages 37 38. As of February 3, 2007, the Company adopted the recognition provisions of SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). Refer to Note 1 for a discussion of the impact of adopting SFAS No. 158. Major assumptions used in accounting for retirement plans include the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate. Assumptions are determined based on Company information and market indicators and are evaluated at each annual measurement date (October 31). A change in any of these assumptions could have a significant effect on the Companys pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs. These assumptions require significant judgment, and the calculation of pension costs is relatively complex. The Company utilizes third parties, including actuarial and investment advisory firms, to help evaluate the appropriateness of the expected rate of return, the discount rate and other pension plan assumptions annually. The following discussion relates to the primary pension plan only, since it represents the majority of the Companys recorded pension expense and related asset/liability amounts in its consolidated financial statements. Demographic Assumptions For purposes of estimating demographic mortality in the measurement of the Companys pension obligation, as of October 31, 2004, the Company began using the Retirement Plans 2000 Table of Combined Healthy Lives (RP 2000 Table), projected to 2005, using Scale AA to forecast mortality improvements five years into the future to 2005. Previously, the Company had utilized the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table, which it continued to use for calculating funding requirements through 2006 based on Internal Revenue Service regulations. This change did not have a material impact on the projected benefit obligation. Beginning in 2007, for funding purposes, the Company will begin using a projected version of the RP 2000 Table. Market Related Value of Plan Assets In accounting for pension costs, the Company uses fair value, which is the market value of plan assets as of the annual measurement date, to calculate the expected return on assets and gain/loss amortization components of net periodic pension expense. Return on Plan Assets and Impact on Earnings ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004 One year actual return on plan assets 17.6% 13.2% 11.7% Expected return on plan assets assumption 8.9% 8.9% 8.9% Pension expense $ 9 $ 69 $ 82 As a result of strong asset performance over the past few years, combined with voluntary Company contributions of $300 million in 2006, 2004, 2003 and 2002 totaling $1.2 billion, pension expense has decreased each year since 2003. Since the inception of the Companys primary pension plan in 1966 through the October 31, 2006 measurement date, the average annual return has been 9.7%. After three years of decline in the fair value of pension assets during the 2000 2002 bear market, pension assets experienced significant increases due to consecutive annual gains in global equity markets during the last four years. Because the fair value of plan assets is measured as of a point in time, the change in fair value between measurement dates affects the subsequent years net pension expense. Since 34 Table of Contents inception, the Companys primary pension plan has incurred cumulative pre tax expense of approximately $192 million. This is the result of cumulative pension expense during the 1966 1984 period of $366 million, cumulative pension income during the 1985 2001 period of $488 million and pension expense in the 2002 2006 period totaling $314 million. The Company has maintained an expected rate of return of 8.9% over the last three years, consistent with historical returns and managements long term view of expected returns. Pension expense, which is a non cash item, will decline in 2007 by approximately $100 million primarily as a result of 2006 positive return on plan assets. To develop its expected return on plan assets, the Company considers its long term asset allocation policy, historical returns on plan assets and overall capital market returns, taking into account current and expected market conditions. The Companys primary pension plan is well diversified with an asset allocation policy that provides for a targeted 70%, 20% and 10% mix of equities (U.S., non U.S. and private), fixed income (investment grade and high yield) and real estate (private and public), respectively. This allocation provides the pension plan with the appropriate balance of investment return and volatility risk, given the funded nature of the plan, its present and future liability characteristics and its long term investment horizon. See Note 17 for a further discussion of the asset allocation strategy for plan assets. Discount Rate 2006 2005 2004 Discount rate for pension expense 5.80% 5.85% 6.35% Discount rate for pension obligation 5.85% 5.80% 5.85% The Company increased the discount rate used to measure the pension obligation from 5.80% to 5.85% in 2006. In the previous two years, the Company lowered the discount rate. The discount rate is based on the yield to maturity of a representative portfolio of AA rated corporate bonds as of the October 31 measurement date each year, with an average cash flow duration similar to the pension liability. This methodology is consistent with guidance in SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, to use the rate currently available on high quality bonds and the subsequent guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission that high quality bonds should be those with at least a AA rating by a recognized rating agency. Sensitivity The sensitivity of the pension expense to a plus or minus one half of one percent of expected return on assets is a decrease or increase in expense of approximately $0.06 per share. Increasing the discount rate by one half of one percent would decrease expense by approximately $0.03 per share, while decreasing the discount rate by one half of one percent would increase the expense by approximately $0.11 per share. The variability of the impact on pension expense of a change in the discount rate is due to the resulting level of net gains or losses that are amortized only to the extent they exceed 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets (the 10 percent corridor under SFAS No. 87). Pension Funding Funding Policy The Companys funding policy is to maintain a well funded pension plan throughout all business and economic cycles. Maintaining a well funded plan over time provides additional financial flexibility to the Company, including lower pension expense and reduced cash contributions, especially in the event of a decline in the capital markets. In addition, a well funded plan assures associates of the plans and the Companys financial ability to continue to provide competitive retirement benefits, while at the same time being cost effective. The Company targets to maintain a funded ratio, which is the plans assets as a percent of the actuarial funding liability under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), in the range of 120% to 150%. The Pension Protection Act (PPA), a 2006 amendment to ERISA, increases the limit on maximum deductible contributions from 100% of the actuarial funding liability to 150%. Increasing the funding limit provides the Company enhanced flexibility to make discretionary pension contributions and to maintain the plans funded ratio within the funding policy target range. The PPA enabled the Company to make a discretionary $300 million pre tax contribution to the plan in the fourth 35 Table of Contents quarter of 2006. In 2005, the Company did not make a discretionary contribution to the pension plan due to the plans well funded position and Internal Revenue Service rules limiting tax deductible contributions. Funding History The Company made cash contributions to its primary pension plan annually during the 1966 1983 period in order to provide an asset base to support the accelerating liability growth in the early years of the plan. Over the 1984 2006 period, the Company made cash contributions to the plan in eight years (1993 1996, 2002 2004, 2006) and no contributions in the other 15 years due to maintaining a well funded plan and the actual investment return on plan assets. Since the plans inception, the Company has contributed $2.0 billion, or approximately $1.2 billion on an after tax basis, to its primary pension plan, including the contribution made in the fourth quarter of 2006. Over this timeframe, the actual investment return on plan assets has generated a significant portion of the $8.3 billion in pension plan total value, defined as $3.0 billion in cumulative benefit payments to retired associates plus $5.3 billion in plan assets as of fiscal year end 2006. In effect, the Companys cumulative after tax cash contributions over this timeframe represent approximately 14% of the plans total value (i.e., $1.2 billion as a percent of $8.3 billion). The remainder of the plans total value has been generated by the actual investment returns since inception. ERISA Funded Status The Companys primary pension plan remains in a well funded position. Although no additional funding was required under ERISA, the Company made discretionary pre tax contributions of $300 million to its primary pension plan in the fourth quarter of 2006 and in the third quarter of 2004. The Company did not make a discretionary contribution to the pension plan in 2005 due to the plans well funded position and Internal Revenue Service rules limiting tax deductible contributions. At October 31, 2006, plan assets of $4.8 billion were 124% of the $3.9 billion ERISA funding liability. Reflecting the fourth quarter 2006 contribution to the plan, the funded status as of year end 2006 was 137%. Expected Contributions Future contributions to the pension plan will be dependent on asset returns and future discount rates impacting the plans actuarial funding liability. The Company does not anticipate mandatory funding requirements in 2007 under ERISA. It plans to make a discretionary contribution, however, if market conditions and the funded position of the pension plan allow such a contribution to be tax deductible. See Note 17 for further discussion. Accounting for Stock Based Compensation The Company has a stock based compensation plan for approximately 1,700 executives and senior management that provides for grants to associates of stock awards (stock or units, restricted or unrestricted), stock appreciation rights or options to purchase the Companys common stock. Over the past three years, the Companys annual stock option grants have averaged about 1.4% of outstanding shares, including the common stock equivalent of preferred shares. As of February 3, 2007, options to purchase 8.3 million shares of common stock, representing 3.7% of total shares, were outstanding, of which 4.3 million were exercisable. Of the exercisable options, 100% were in the money, or had an exercise price below the closing end of year stock price of $83.70. Prior to 2005, the Company followed Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, which did not require expense recognition for stock options when the exercise price of an option equaled, or exceeded, the quoted market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Effective January 30, 2005, the Company early adopted SFAS No. 123R, which requires the use of the fair value method for accounting for all stock based compensation, including stock options. The statement was adopted using the modified prospective method of application. Under this method, in addition to reflecting compensation expense for new share based awards, expense is also recognized to reflect the remaining vesting period of awards that had been included in pro forma disclosures in prior periods. The Company did not adjust prior year financial statements under the optional modified retrospective method of application, but has disclosed the pro forma impact of expensing stock options on 2004 in Note 1. 36 Table of Contents Stock Based Compensation Cost in the Consolidated Statements of Operations ($ in millions) 2006 2005 2004(1) Stock awards (shares and units) $ 34 $ 6 $ 23 Stock options 26 32 Total stock based compensation cost in the Consolidated Statements of Operations $ 60 $ 38 $ 23 Total income tax benefit recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for stock based compensation arrangements $ 23 (2) $ 15 (2) $ 9 (1) See Note 1 for the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the fair value method had been applied to all outstanding awards in 2004. (2) Of the total, $10 million and $12 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, related to stock options. Prior to 2005, the Company used the Black Scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of its stock option awards. For grants subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company estimates the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using a binomial lattice model developed by outside consultants who worked with the Company in the implementation of SFAS No. 123R. The Company believes that the binomial lattice model is a more accurate model for valuing employee stock options since it better reflects the impact of stock price changes on option exercise behavior. The expected volatility used in the binomial lattice model is based on an analysis of historical prices of JCPenneys stock and open market exchanged options, and was developed in consultation with an outside valuation specialist and the Companys financial advisors. The expected volatility reflects the volatility implied from a price quoted for a hypothetical call option with a duration consistent with the expected life of the options and the volatility implied by the trading of options to purchase the Companys stock on open market exchanges. As a result of the Companys recently completed turnaround that began in 2001 and the disposition of the Eckerd drugstore operations, a significant portion of historical volatility is not considered to be a good indicator of future volatility. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the binomial lattice model, and represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding. This model incorporates an early exercise assumption in the event of a significant increase in stock price. The risk free rate is based on zero coupon U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the date of grant with the same period as the expected option life. The dividend yield is assumed to increase ratably to the Companys expected dividend yield level based on targeted payout ratios over the expected life of the options. As of February 3, 2007, there was $25 million and $33 million of compensation cost not yet recognized or earned related to stock options and associate restricted stock (share and unit) awards, respectively, which is expected to be recognized as earned over weighted average periods of 1.0 and 1.2 years, respectively. See Notes 1 and 15 for more details about the Companys stock based compensation. Retirement and Medical Benefit Plan Changes In April 2006, the Companys Board of Directors approved several benefit plan changes in recognition of the declining prevalence of defined benefit pension plans in the retail industry and the increasing value that associates place on portability of retirement benefits. The overarching goal was to provide competitive benefits that are cost effective for both the Company and its associates. These changes include replacing the current Company matching contribution of 4.5% of available profits with a fixed Company matching contribution of 50 cents on each dollar contributed up to 6% of pay to the Companys 401(k) defined contribution plan. The Company will retain the flexibility to make additional discretionary matching contributions. The pension plan was closed to associates hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2007. A replacement benefit is being provided to those associates in the form of a retirement account, a component of the defined contribution 401(k) plan, whereby the Company will contribute an amount equal to 2% of participants annual pay after one year of service. Participating associates will be fully vested after three years. Associates hired or rehired on or prior to December 31, 2006 will remain in the Companys pension plan and continue to earn credited service. 37 Table of Contents Finally, medical benefits for active associates were modified to increase the percentage of costs borne by the Company. These benefit plan changes were communicated to associates in May 2006 and became effective January 1, 2007. The changes did not have a significant impact on fiscal year 2006 retirement benefit and medical plan expenses, and going forward, the aggregate impact is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. For a further discussion of these changes, see Note 17. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued two standards that address accounting for income taxes: FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS 13 2, Accounting for a Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction, and FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. FSP FAS 13 2 requires a recalculation of returns on leveraged leases if there is a change or projected change in the timing of cash flows relating to income taxes generated by the leveraged lease. The adoption of FSP FAS 13 2 effective at the beginning of 2007 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. FIN 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for recognizing, measuring, presenting and disclosing in the financial statements uncertain tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take in its tax returns. It applies to all tax positions accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 109 and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company will apply the provisions of this interpretation beginning in the first quarter of 2007, and currently expects that its adoption will not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial position. The Company does, however, expect to make certain balance sheet reclassifications upon the adoption of this interpretation. In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, this Statement does not require any new fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 will be effective as of the beginning of the Companys fiscal 2008. The Company does not expect that the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 (SAB 108), Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements. SAB 108 addresses how the effect of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be evaluated when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements. SAB 108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using a balance sheet and income statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantified error that is material in light of the relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The provisions of SAB 108 became effective during the fourth quarter of 2006 but had no impact on the financial position or operating results of the Company. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities. This statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. If the fair value option is elected, unrealized gains and losses will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this adoption on its consolidated financial statements. 38 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2007 Guidance On February 22, 2007, management communicated the following initial guidance for 2007 in the Companys fourth quarter and full year 2006 earnings release: Total department store sales are expected to increase mid single digits for 2007, while comparable department store sales are expected to increase low single digits. Direct sales are expected to increase low single digits for the year. Full year operating income margin is expected to reflect moderate year over year improvement, with contributions from both gross margin and expense leverage. The effective income tax rate for the year is expected to increase to approximately 38.6%. Earnings from continuing operations are expected to be in the area of $5.44 per share for 2007. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information This Annual Report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements made within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which reflect the Companys current view of future events and financial performance. The words expect, plan, anticipate, believe, intent, should, will and similar expressions identify forward looking statements. Any such forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause the Companys actual results to be materially different from planned or expected results. Those risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, competition, consumer demand, seasonality, economic conditions, including the price and availability of oil and natural gas, impact of changes in consumer credit payment terms, changes in management, retail industry consolidations, a pandemic, acts of terrorism or war and government activity. Furthermore, the Company typically earns a disproportionate share of its operating income in the fourth quarter due to holiday buying patterns, and such buying patterns are difficult to forecast with certainty. While the Company believes that its assumptions are reasonable, it cautions that it is impossible to predict the degree to which any such factors could cause actual results to differ materially from predicted results. For additional discussion on risks and uncertainties, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, beginning on page 4. The Company intends the forward looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K to speak only as of the date of this report and does not undertake to update or revise these projections as more information becomes available. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The Company maintains a majority of its cash and short term investments in financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less. Such investments are subject to interest rate risk and may have a small decline in value if interest rates increase. Since the financial instruments are of short duration, a change of 100 basis points in interest rates would not have a material effect on the Companys financial condition. All of the Companys outstanding long term debt as of February 3, 2007 is at fixed interest rates and would not be affected by interest rate changes. Future borrowings under the Companys multi year revolving credit facility, to the extent that fluctuating rate loans were used, would be affected by interest rate changes. As of February 3, 2007, no cash borrowings were outstanding under the facility, and approximately $122 million in letters of credit were supported by this facility. The Company does not believe that a change of 100 basis points in interest rates would have a material effect on the Companys financial condition. The fair value of long term debt is estimated by obtaining quotes from brokers or is based on current rates offered for similar debt. At February 3, 2007, long term debt, excluding equipment financing, capital leases and other, had a carrying value of $3.4 billion and a fair value of $3.6 billion. At January 28, 2006, long term debt, excluding equipment financing, capital leases and other, had a carrying value of $3.4 billion and a fair value of $3.7 billion. The effects of changes in the U.S. equity and bond markets serve to increase or decrease the value of assets in the Companys qualified pension plan, which is well funded. At the October 31, 2006 measurement date, plan assets of $4.8 billion were approximately 124% of the $3.9 billion actuarial funding liability under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). The Company seeks to manage exposure to adverse equity and bond returns by maintaining diversified investment portfolios and utilizing professional investment managers. 39 Table of Contents
