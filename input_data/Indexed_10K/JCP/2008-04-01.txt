Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion, which presents the results of JCPenney, should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto beginning on page F 3, along with the unaudited Five Year Financial and Operations Summaries on pages 11 and 12, the risk factors beginning on page 4 and the cautionary statement regarding forward looking information on page 38. Unless otherwise indicated, this Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) relates only to results from continuing operations, all references to earnings per share (EPS) are on a diluted basis and all references to years relate to fiscal years rather than to calendar years. Fiscal 2007 and 2005 each contained 52 weeks, while 2006 contained 53 weeks. Corporate Governance and Financial Reporting The Company remains committed to maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance and continuously improving the transparency of its financial reporting, by providing stockholders with informative financial disclosures and presenting a clear and balanced view of the Companys financial position and operating results. Management continues to employ a reporting matrix that requires written certifications on a quarterly basis from a cross disciplined team of approximately 20 senior members of its management team who have responsibility for preparing, verifying and reporting corporate results. For this Annual Report on Form 10 K, the Company made further enhancements to its financial reporting with expanded disclosures in several areas, such as: adding a description of key performance indicators evaluated by senior management; providing quantification of the estimated range of potential environmental exposures and discussion of the underlying judgments and assumptions; including outstanding merchandise purchase orders issued to suppliers in the contractual obligation table; adding further sensitivity analysis to the discussion of the Companys critical accounting policies; and disclosing the amount of cooperative advertising reimbursements netted against gross advertising costs. Consistent with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes Oxley Act), the Company is required to report on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting each fiscal year. In relation to these requirements, the Companys external auditors expressed an unqualified opinion regarding the effective operation of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Executive Overview Key Performance Indicators In evaluating the Companys results, senior management reviews the following key performance indicators: Comparable store sales Comparable store sales, which are presented on a 52 week basis, provide a measure of existing store sales productivity and performance. Beginning in 2008, the Company changed its sales reporting methodology to include online sales, through jcp.com, in comparable store 13 Table of Contents sales. This change better reflects the Companys current initiative to consolidate the merchandising and marketing for department stores, jcp.com and catalog and is consistent with the sales reporting practices of key retail competitors. Under this new methodology, comparable store sales include sales from new stores, relocated stores and stores reopened after being closed for an extended period after having been open for 12 full consecutive fiscal months, as well as online sales from jcp.com. Stores remodeled and minor expansions not requiring store closure remain in the comparable store sales calculation. Management considers comparable store sales to be a key indicator of the Companys current performance measuring the growth in sales and sales productivity of existing stores. Positive comparable store sales contribute to greater leveraging of costs, particularly payroll and occupancy costs, while negative comparable store sales contribute to de leveraging of costs. Comparable store sales also have a direct impact on the Companys total net sales and the level of cash flow. Gross margin Gross margin is the difference between total net sales and cost of the merchandise sold and is typically expressed as a percentage of total net sales. The cost of merchandise sold includes all direct costs of bringing merchandise to its final selling destination. These costs include the cost of the merchandise (net of discounts or allowances earned), freight costs, warehousing costs, sourcing and procurement costs, buying and brand development costs including buyers salaries and related expenses, merchandise examination, inspection and testing, store merchandise distribution center expenses and shipping and handling costs incurred related to direct sales to customers. Gross margin is a measure of profitability of a retail company at the most fundamental level of buying and selling merchandise and measures a companys ability to effectively manage the total costs of sourcing and allocating merchandise against the corresponding retail pricing designed to offer quality merchandise at smart prices. Gross margins not only cover marketing, selling and other operating expenses, but also must include a profit element to reinvest back into the business. Operating income Operating income is equal to earnings before net interest expense, bond premiums and unamortized costs and income tax expense. Operating income is a measure of the Companys earnings power from the ongoing retail operations and is the key measurement on which management evaluates the operating performance of its business. The key drivers of operating income are total net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Sales productivity The Company, along with its peers, makes significant investments in building, renovating and operating stores. Management measures the returns on those investments through productivity measures such as sales per square foot. Sales per square foot is the result of customer traffic times the sales conversion rate times the number of units sold at an average unit retail selling price. Management uses these measures to evaluate and assess the operational performance of department stores in the Companys portfolio. These metrics are compared against expectations and key retail competitors to measure the productivity of and return on store investments and the success of the Companys merchandise offerings. In addition, management monitors the productivity of its web site and catalog pages using similar metrics, such as sales per web site page or catalog page, average unit retail and number of units sold. Inventory turnover Inventory turnover is calculated as cost of goods sold divided by average inventory. 14 Table of Contents Management evaluates inventory turnover as a measure of how productively and efficiently inventory is moved through the supply chain, from sourcing to allocation to stores or Direct to consumer warehouses, and ultimately sale to JCPenney customers. This ratio allows management to monitor the effectiveness of the Companys supply chain management and the productivity of capital resources employed. Cash flow Cash flow refers to the amount of cash generated and used by the Company in carrying out its business activities during the reporting period. Cash flow is classified into three separate activities: operating cash flows, which is cash received or expended as a result of the companys core business activities; investing cash flows, representing cash received or expended through capital expenditure, investments, acquisitions or divestitures; and financing cash flows, defined as cash received or expended as a result of financial activities, such as issuing or repaying long term debt, issuing or repurchasing stock, and paying dividends. Positive operating cash flow is an indicator of the sustainability of the Companys business model of selling merchandise and services to customers. Strong operating cash flows, combined with solid cash investment balances, provides the Company liquidity and flexibility to achieve an appropriate balance between longer term business opportunities and near term economic pressures. Management evaluates cash flow to determine the sufficiency of the Companys liquidity in the context of working capital requirements, upcoming debt maturities, maintaining the current dividend level and reinvesting operating cash flow into capital expenditures to drive the Companys growth initiatives. 2007 Highlights Sales Performance Comparable store sales were flat in 2007 following six consecutive years of increases, including a 4.9% increase in 2006, reflecting a significant slowdown in consumer spending, especially in the second half of 2007. Online sales, through jcp.com, continue to be the Companys fastest growing sales channel, increasing approximately 15% on a 52 week basis, to $1.5 billion in 2007, while catalog print media and outlet stores declined 15% from the prior year. Store Productivity In 2007, the Company experienced a slight increase in productivity in its store portfolio with sales per gross square foot, including online sales, increasing to $177 in 2007 from $176 in 2006. Sales productivity in 2007 for new and relocated stores opened in 2003 through 2006 performed above the Company average. Including the annualized sales of new stores opened in 2007, most of which opened in the second half of the year and were more heavily impacted by the acceleration of the consumer spending slowdown, sales productivity for all new stores continue to be higher than the Company average. Store Growth and Renovations During 2007, the Company opened 50 new and relocated stores, 42 of which are in the new off mall format. For the year, net square footage grew 3.4%. In addition to the new stores opened, the Company remodeled 65 existing stores. Operating Performance 2007 operating income decreased 20 basis points to 9.5% of sales, driven by negative trends in sales, which resulted in a more promotional selling environment and higher levels of clearance merchandise. 15 Table of Contents Operating Income ($ in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Total net sales $ 19,860 $ 19,903 $ 18,781 Gross margin $ 7,671 $ 7,825 $ 7,191 Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) 5,357 5,521 5,227 Depreciation and amortization 426 389 372 Pre opening 46 27 15 Real estate and other (income), net (46 ) (34 ) (54 ) Total operating expenses 5,783 5,903 5,560 Operating income $ 1,888 $ 1,922 $ 1,631 As a percent of sales 9.5% 9.7% 8.7% Income from continuing operations for 2007 decreased 2.6% to $1,105 million, compared to $1,134 million in 2006. Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $4.90 for 2007 versus $4.88 in 2006. The 2007 results reflected tax credits of $38 million, or $0.17 per share, while 2006 results reflected a tax credit of $32 million, or $0.14 per share, both of which were due to the release of income tax reserves resulting from the favorable resolution of prior year tax matters. EPS in 2007 benefited from the reduction in average shares outstanding compared to the prior year due to the Companys 2007 and 2006 common stock repurchase programs.

Stores remodeled and minor expansions not requiring store closure remain in the comparable store sales calculation. Beginning in 2008, the Company changed its sales reporting to include online sales, through jcp.com, in comparable store sales. Comparable store sales presented in the table above have been reclassified for all periods presented to include jcp.com sales. 2007 Private and Exclusive Brand Launches During 2007, the Company launched several new private and exclusive brands. These included Ambrielle&reg;, a new private label lingerie brand, two new exclusive brands by Liz Claiborne, Inc., Liz & Co.&reg;, a traditional casual womens apparel and accessories line, and CONCEPTS by Claiborne, featuring casual sportswear as well as suits and accessories for the modern male customer, C7P&reg;, a Chip & Pepper&reg; Production, a denim and sportswear line for juniors and young men, and Messages from the Heart&reg;, an infant apparel and gift brand by author and artist Sandra Magsamen. 16 Table of Contents Expanded Sephora inside JCPenney The Company expanded the total Sephora inside JCPenney locations to 47 as of year end 2007. Sephora inside JCPenney continues to perform well, with sales productivity well above the Company average. In early 2008, the Company opened additional Sephora inside JCPenney locations, and expects 72 by the end of the first quarter, with plans to expand to nearly 300 locations by the end of 2010. New Every Day Matters&reg; Brand Positioning In early 2007, JCPenney launched its new brand positioning: Every Day Matters&reg;, which is expected to position JCPenney as a lifestyle solution for its target customers. This theme is evident in every aspect of the Companys business, from its approach to merchandising to its marketing and advertising, to most importantly, its enhanced customer service, with associates focused on developing enduring relationships with customers. Results from ongoing customer surveys continue to show increasing customer satisfaction and positive perceptions in categories surveyed. Capital Structure and Credit Profile During 2007, the Company completed a $400 million stock repurchase program. Combined with the 2006 stock repurchase program and the 2005 and 2004 capital structure repositioning programs, which were initiated in conjunction with the 2004 sale of Eckerd, the Company has purchased $5.3 billion of its common stock since the beginning of 2004. The Company issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of new senior unsecured notes in 2007, redeemed $303 million of debentures early and paid off $425 million of maturing debt. Throughout 2007, the Company maintained its investment grade credit ratings from all three major credit rating agencies. Current Developments 2008 Brand Launches In February 2008, the Company launched American Living, a new updated traditional lifestyle brand created exclusively for JCPenney by Polo Ralph Laurens Global Brand Concepts. The launch is the largest in the Companys history. Polo Ralph Laurens Global Brand Concepts is responsible for merchandise design and collaborates with the Company on marketing and advertising. American Living is in the best segment of the Companys offerings across 40 merchandise categories for women, men and children, as well as shoes, accessories and home goods, and is available in JCPenneys stores, catalog and on jcp.com. The Company recently announced the Spring 2008 launch of Le Tigre&reg; from Kenneth Cole, an active inspired brand in junior sportswear with plans to expand into junior footwear and accessories as well as young mens apparel, footwear and accessories. In addition, the Company launched Simply Green, an exclusive JCPenney designation, that highlights eco friendly products across a wide range of private label merchandise. In March 2008, the Company announced the launch of Fabulosity&reg;, a Juniors fashion sportswear line designed by Kimora Lee Simmons, that will be offered exclusively at JCPenney in time for the Back to School season. Recent Awards In March 2008, JCPenney was recognized by Institutional Investor magazine as the most shareholder friendly company within the broadline/department store segment for the second year in a row. Rankings were based on responses from more than 640 analysts and portfolio managers asked to rank companies effectiveness in corporate governance and investor relations. 17 Table of Contents In March 2008, for the second year in a row, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency named J. C. Penney Company, Inc. as the ENERGY STAR&reg; Retail Partner of the Year for outstanding energy management and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The award winners are selected from thousands of organizations that participate in the ENERGY STAR&reg; program. Additional awards include JCPenney being one of 34 recipients of the SmartWay Excellence Awards that honor organizations that integrate innovative strategies and technologies into their business operations, resulting in reduced energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis, consistent with all other financial data throughout this Annual Report on Form 10 K, focuses on the results of operations and financial condition from the Companys continuing operations. Results for 2007 reflected a deteriorating consumer environment. Like other retailers, the Company faced a challenging consumer environment. The combination of weak housing conditions, mortgage and credit market concerns and rising fuel and food prices led to a challenging macroeconomic environment for consumers, resulting in a softening in sales, particularly in the second half of the year. The negative sales trend which became more evident in the second half of 2007 has continued into the first quarter of 2008 and it is currently expected that a difficult economic environment will continue over the course of 2008. Income from Continuing Operations Income from continuing operations was $1,105 million in 2007, compared to $1,134 million in 2006 and $977 million in 2005. 2007 was impacted by pressure on gross margins in a more promotional selling environment in the second half of the year. The impact of gross margin pressure from a weak consumer spending environment was more than offset by effective control of operating expenses, even with higher expenses related to new store openings. 2006 earnings increased as a result of strong sales and gross margin improvement, combined with lower interest expense and bond premiums. EPS from continuing operations in 2007 was $4.90, compared to $4.88 in 2006 and $3.83 in 2005. EPS in 2007 benefited from the reduction in average shares outstanding compared to the prior year due to the Companys 2007 and 2006 common stock repurchase programs. Total Net Sales ($ in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Total net sales $ 19,860 $ 19,903 $ 18,781 Sales percent (decrease)/increase Total net sales (0.2 )%(1) 6.0 %(1) 3.8 % Comparable store sales(2) 0.0 % 4.9 % 4.2 % Sales per gross square foot(3) $ 177 $ 176 $ 167 (1) Includes the effect of the 53rd week in 2006. Excluding sales of $254 million for the 53rd week in 2006, total net sales increased 1.1% and 4.6% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. (2) Comparable store sales are presented on a 52 week basis, and include sales from new stores, relocated stores and stores reopened after being closed for an extended period (e.g., stores closed due to natural disasters) after they have been open for 12 full consecutive fiscal months. Stores remodeled and minor expansions not requiring store closure remain in the comparable store sales calculation. Beginning in 2008, the Company changed its sales reporting to include online sales, through jcp.com, in comparable store sales. Comparable store sales presented in the table above have been reclassified for all periods presented to include jcp.com sales. (3) Calculation includes the sales of stores that were open for the full fiscal year as of each year end, as well as online sales from jcp.com. The 2006 calculation excludes sales of the 53rd week. 18 Table of Contents Total net sales decreased $43 million, or 0.2%, from $19,903 million in 2006 to $19,860 million in 2007, primarily as a result of the 53rd week in 2006 and the expected decline in catalog print media and outlet store sales. Excluding sales of $254 million for the 53rd week of 2006, total net sales increased 1.1%. New store sales, net of closings, added $456 million in 2007. Comparable store sales, including online sales, were flat with 2006. Comparable store sales were negatively impacted by a decline in JCPenney mall store traffic of approximately 4.0%, consistent with overall mall traffic trends, while the average unit retail and the number of transactions remained at comparable levels to the prior year. Although sales were soft across most merchandise categories, the Companys best performing categories were womens and childrens apparel. The weakest sales results were in most home categories, mens and fine jewelry. Geographically, the western regions reported sales gains during 2007, while decreases were reported in the eastern and central regions of the country. Total net sales increased $1,122 million, or 6.0%, from $18,781 million in 2005 to $19,903 million in 2006. Comparable store sales increased 4.9% in 2006, driven primarily by an increase in sales transactions, and an increase in online sales of 24%, coupled with positive trends in both units per transaction and average unit retail. Private and exclusive brands found only at JCPenney, totaled approximately 49%, 48% and 47% of total merchandise sales for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Total Net Sales Mix The following percentages represent the mix of total net sales: 2007 2006 2005 Womens apparel 23% 22% 22% Home 21% 21% 22% Mens apparel and accessories 20% 20% 20% Childrens apparel 11% 11% 11% Womens accessories 9% 10% 10% Family footwear 6% 6% 6% Fine jewelry 5% 5% 5% Services and other 5% 5% 4% 100% 100% 100% Merchandise Initiatives The Company continues to enhance its strong private, exclusive and national brands that develop customer loyalty by focusing its merchandise more closely on customer lifestyles. Resources continue to be focused on the Companys branding efforts to ensure consistency in product design, packaging, in store and web site presentation, lifestyle marketing and point of sale support. In February 2007, the Company launched Ambrielle&reg;, a new private label lingerie brand. In response to feedback from customers and research of direct competitors, Ambrielle&reg; was created to fill a void in the marketplace for a sensual lingerie brand targeted to the modern customer at a smart price. Also in February 2007, the Company launched two new exclusive brands by Liz Claiborne, Inc., Liz & Co.&reg;, a traditional casual womens apparel and accessories line, and CONCEPTS by Claiborne, featuring casual sportswear as well as suits and accessories for the modern male customer. During the back to school season, the Company launched C7P&reg;, a Chip & Pepper&reg; Production, a denim and 19 Table of Contents sportswear line for juniors and young men. In January 2008, the Company launched Messages from the Heart&reg;, an infant apparel and gift brand by author and artist Sandra Magsamen, further enhancing the Companys broad assortment of merchandise for babies and children. Management is pleased with customer response and sales results for all of the Companys new merchandise launches. In April 2006, the Company began offering beauty and fragrance products in its stores through Sephora inside JCPenney locations and through the Internet. Through year end 2007, the Company expanded Sephora inside JCPenney locations to 47 stores. Sephora inside JCPenney locations had a strong 2007 holiday season and continues to perform well attracting new customers to JCPenney. In early 2008, the Company opened additional Sephora inside JCPenney locations, and expects 72 by the end of the first quarter, with plans to expand to nearly 300 locations by the end of 2010. Store and Online Shopping Experience Based on customer feedback, the Company has taken several actions to improve the customer shopping experience across all channels, including more closely aligning in store and online promotions and merchandise offerings to improve effectiveness while maintaining the capability to address unique customer needs in each channel. To enhance customers in store experiences, the Company has invested in renovating existing stores, enhancing in store visual displays, accelerated the investment in new stores, particularly the off mall format, as well as reconfigured the store staffing model to better serve customers while providing cost efficiencies. The Company opened 50 new and relocated stores in 2007, 42 of which were off mall, bringing the total new off mall stores concept to 88 locations. In 2007, the Company launched a Know Before You Go initiative on jcp.com, which provides customers with innovative features such as enhanced search capabilities and product information, merchandise availability at local stores and the ability to view weekly sales circulars online, making shopping at JCPenney easier and more efficient. During 2006, the Company completed its rollout of a new point of sale (POS) system to all stores. The POS system reduces transaction time and provides Internet connectivity to all in store POS devices to enhance the customer shopping experience. In addition, since 2002, the Company has used a customer scorecard to assess progress being made versus key competitors across a broad range of metrics related to areas such as merchandise, shopping environment and services. Since initiating the customer scorecard, JCPenney has made substantial progress across all areas. Gross Margin ($ in millions) 2007 2006 2005 First in first out (FIFO) gross margin $ 7,664 $ 7,809 $ 7,190 Last in first out (LIFO) credit 7 16 1 Gross margin $ 7,671 $ 7,825 $ 7,191 As a percent of sales 38.6% 39.3% 38.3% Through the first half of 2007, gross margin increased 70 basis points to 39.8% of sales, or $3,481 million on a dollar basis, compared to 39.1%, or $3,305 million, for the comparable 2006 period. Gross margin was pressured in the third and fourth quarters by an inventory plan that anticipated higher sales and thus resulted in more promotional selling and higher levels of clearance merchandise. As a result, 2007 full year gross margin declined 70 basis points, as a percent of sales, following a 100 basis point improvement in 2006. 20 Table of Contents Gross margin improvement of 100 basis points in 2006 was on top of an 80 basis point improvement in 2005. The improvement reflected continued strength in the performance of the Companys private brands, ongoing improvements in inventory management, including better flow of seasonal goods resulting in lower markdowns, and a larger contribution to sales from higher margin merchandise divisions. The higher LIFO credit in 2006 was the result of favorable costing, coupled with higher inventory levels. Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses ($ in millions) 2007 2006 2005 SG&A $ 5,357 $ 5,521 $ 5,227 As a percent of sales 27.0% 27.7% 27.8% For 2007, SG&A expenses were 27.0% of sales, an improvement of 70 basis points, compared to 27.7% of sales for 2006. On a dollar basis, SG&A expenses for 2007 were down 3.0% from 2006. Advertising expenses, as a percent of sales, were consistent with last year. While overall SG&A expenses were well controlled, the two primary contributors to the year over year improvement were lower salary and related expenses, including the previously disclosed decline in pension expense, as well as lower incentive compensation expense. SG&A expenses improved by 10 basis points in 2006 to 27.7% of sales, on top of a 60 basis point improvement in 2005. As a percent of sales, advertising costs increased 30 basis points, while total retirement related benefit plan expenses decreased 30 basis points. Increased advertising expenses included costs related to the March 2006 virtual store at One Times Square in New York City, the Companys exclusive retail sponsorship of the Academy Awards and other television award shows. The decrease in retirement related benefit plan expenses was driven by the $60 million decrease in qualified pension plan expense, which resulted from strong investment returns on the plans assets. Total SG&A expense dollars increased 5.6% in 2006, driven by marketing and store staffing expenditures made to support a successful holiday season, operating costs for the 28 new stores added during the year, as well as incremental operating expenses related to the 53rd week of 2006, which were approximately $65 million. Vendor Allowances The Company receives vendor support in the form of cash payments or allowances through a variety of reimbursements for cooperative advertising, markdowns, vendor shipping and packaging compliance and defective merchandise. The Company has agreements in place with each vendor setting forth the specific conditions for each allowance or payment. Depending on the arrangement, the Company either recognizes the allowance as a reduction of current costs or defers the payment over the period the related merchandise is sold. If the payment is a reimbursement for costs incurred, it is offset against those related costs; otherwise, it is treated as a reduction to the cost of merchandise. For cooperative advertising programs offered by national brands, the Company generally offsets the allowances against the related advertising expense. Certain programs require proof of advertising to be provided to the vendor to support the reimbursement of the incurred cost. Programs that do not require proof of advertising are monitored to ensure that the allowance provided by each vendor is a reimbursement of costs incurred to advertise for that particular vendors label. In the event that the allowance exceeds the advertising costs incurred on a vendor specific basis, any excess allowance for 21 Table of Contents the vendor is recorded as a reduction of merchandise cost. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, advertising allowances offsetting gross advertising expense were $210 million, $163 million and $139 million, respectively. Depreciation and Amortization Expenses As expected with the accelerated store growth and investments in improving existing facilities, depreciation and amortization expenses increased to $426 million in 2007, compared to $389 million in 2006 and $372 million in 2005. As a percent of sales, depreciation and amortization expenses were consistent from year to year at approximately 2%. Pre Opening Expense Pre opening expense includes costs such as advertising, hiring and training costs for new associates, processing and stocking initial merchandise inventory and rental costs. With the launch of the Companys accelerated store growth strategy in 2006, pre opening expense increased to $46 million in 2007, compared to $27 million in 2006 and $15 million in 2005. The Company opened 50, 28 and 18 new stores, in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Real Estate and Other (Income), Net ($ in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Real estate activities $ (38) $ (35) $ (32) Net gains from sale of real estate (10) (8) (27) Other 2 9 5 Total $ (46) $ (34) $ (54) Real estate and other consists primarily of ongoing operating income from the Companys real estate subsidiaries. In addition, net gains were recorded from the sale of facilities and equipment that are no longer used in Company operations. For 2005, approximately half of the gain from the sale of real estate was from the sale of a vacant merchandise processing facility that was made obsolete by the centralized network of store distribution centers put in place in 2003. In 2006, the Company recorded charges of $7 million associated with a senior management transition, which is included in Other. Operating Income ($ in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Operating income(1) $ 1,888 $ 1,922 $ 1,631 As a percent of sales 9.5% 9.7% 8.7% (1) See definition of Operating Income on page 14. 2007 operating income declined by 0.2%, or 20 basis points as a percent of sales, driven by a negative trend in sales and gross margin rates. While the Company continued to make significant improvements in merchandise assortments, as well as further refinements to the Companys planning and allocation systems to ensure that the merchandise is in the right place at the right time, the challenging retail 22 Table of Contents environment in 2007 led to a softening in sales and a related increase in markdowns. Operating income is the key measurement management uses to evaluate the financial performance of the Companys retail operations. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense totaled $153 million, $130 million and $169 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net interest expense consists primarily of interest expense on long term debt, net of interest income earned on cash and short term investments. The 2007 increase in net interest expense was primarily the result of an increase in average long term debt, combined with a decrease in short term investments and a decrease in corresponding short term interest rates. The lower level of net interest expense in 2006 resulted from higher short term interest rates earned on cash and short term investment balances. The weighted average interest rate on long term debt declined to 7.5% in 2007, compared to 7.8% in both 2006 and 2005. Interest income earned on short term investments remained about the same in 2007 as the prior year at an average annual interest rate of 5.0%, compared to 3.2% in 2005. Bond Premiums and Unamortized Costs The Company incurred premiums, commissions and unamortized costs of $12 million in 2007 related to the early redemption of JCPs 8.125% Debentures Due 2027 and $18 million in 2005 related to the purchase of debt in the open market. These costs are reflected in Bond Premiums and Unamortized Costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. No such costs were incurred by the Company in 2006. Income Taxes The overall effective tax rates for continuing operations were 35.9%, 36.7% and 32.3% for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The 2007 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the release of $38 million, or $0.17 per share, of income tax reserves resulting from the favorable resolution of prior year tax matters. The 2006 rate was favorably impacted by the release of $32 million, or $0.14 per share, of income tax reserves resulting from the favorable resolution of prior year tax matters. The 2005 rate reflected a credit of $49 million, or $0.20 per share, which was principally attributable to reversing the remaining state tax net operating loss valuation allowance. Also benefiting 2005 was a one time credit of $5 million related to changes in state income tax laws. The 2008 effective income tax rate is expected to normalize at a rate of approximately 38%. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations added $0.03 per share to net income in 2007 resulting from managements on going review and true up of Eckerd reserves. For 2006 and 2005, discontinued operations added $0.08 and $0.43 per share to net income, respectively. The 2006 credit was primarily related to positive variances on tax reserves that had been provided for in connection with the sale of previously owned businesses, while the 2005 credit was principally related to favorable resolution of certain tax matters associated with the Companys former Eckerd Drugstore operations. Lojas Renner S.A. In July 2005, the Company sold its interest in Lojas Renner S. A. (Renner), a Brazilian department store chain, and received $260 million of net proceeds that were used for common stock repurchases. This transaction resulted in a cumulative pre tax gain of $26 million, $1 million after tax, including an $8 million credit related to taxes that was recorded in 2006. The relatively high tax cost was largely 23 Table of Contents due to the tax basis of the Companys investment in Renner being lower than its book basis as a result of accounting for the investment under the cost method for tax purposes. Included in the pre tax gain on the sale was $83 million of foreign currency translation losses that had accumulated since the Company acquired its controlling interest in Renner. Eckerd Drugstores During 2007, the Company recorded an after tax credit of $6 million related to the Eckerd discontinued operations as a result of managements ongoing review and true up of the reserves established at the closing of the Eckerd sale in 2004. Through 2007, the cumulative loss on the sale was $705 million pre tax, or $1,320 million on an after tax basis. The relatively high tax cost is a result of the tax basis of Eckerd being lower than its book basis because the Companys previous drugstore acquisitions were largely tax free transactions. The more significant remaining reserve related to the Eckerd sale is for estimated environmental exposures, which is discussed on page 33. Management believes that the overall reserves, as adjusted, are adequate as of February 2, 2008 and consistent with original estimates. Cash payments for the Eckerd related reserves are included in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as Cash Paid for Discontinued Operations, with tax payments included in operating cash flows and all other payments included in investing cash flows. Discontinued operations for 2006 and 2005 also included combined after tax credits of $7 million and $8 million, respectively, to adjust the loss on the sale of the six Mexico department stores, which were sold in 2003, and the sale of J. C. Penney Direct Marketing Services, Inc.s (DMSs) assets, which were sold in 2001. No such adjustments were recorded in 2007. The Companys financial statements, accompanying notes and other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10 K reflect these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Financial Condition and Liquidity The Companys financial condition remains strong and provides the flexibility to continue to reinvest capital into the business to support strategic initiatives. While the retail environment changed dramatically during 2007, the Company has been able to maintain a strong financial position and retain the flexibility to continue the implementation of key growth initiatives. The ability to reinvest capital into growth strategies will enable the Company to enhance its competitive position, and provide a strengthened financial position going forward to take advantage of future opportunities as the environment improves. Cash and Short Term Investments At year end 2007, the Company had approximately $2.5 billion of cash and short term investments, which represented nearly 67% of its $3.7 billion of outstanding long term debt, including current maturities. The Companys short term investment balances are invested in short term U.S. Treasury money market funds and a portfolio of highly rated bank deposits. Cash and short term investments included restricted short term investment balances of $49 million as of February 2, 2008, pledged as collateral for a portion of casualty insurance program liabilities. In 2007, the cash and short term investment balance was increased by net proceeds of $980 million from the offering of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of new senior notes. More than offsetting this increase was the early redemption of $303 million principal amount of debentures, the repayment at maturity of $425 million of long term debt and the completion of a $400 million stock repurchase program. 24 Table of Contents In addition to cash and short term investments, the Companys liquidity position includes a five year $1.2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that was put in place in April 2005 (2005 Credit Agreement). For further discussion on the credit agreement, see page 29. The Companys liquidity is enhanced by the fact that the current debt portfolio and material lease agreements contain no provisions that could trigger acceleration of payments or collateral support in the event of adverse changes in the Companys financial condition. Cash Flows The following is a summary of the Companys cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for both continuing and discontinued operations: ($ in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Net cash provided by/(used in): Continuing operations: Operating activities(1) $ 1,244 $ 1,255 $ 1,337 Investing activities (1,217 ) (752 ) (221 ) Financing activities (286 ) (751 ) (2,652 ) Discontinued operations: Operating activities 8 11 82 Investing activities (25 ) (32 ) (187 ) Financing activities 8 Net (decrease) in cash and short term investments $ (276 ) $ (269 ) $ (1,633 ) (1) Includes a $300 million discretionary cash contribution to the Companys qualified pension plan in 2006. The approximately $110 million tax benefit related to the 2006 contribution was not realized until fiscal 2007. No such contributions were made in 2007 or 2005. Since 2003, the Companys improved operating performance and the redeployment of capital from the sale of Eckerd have provided the financial flexibility to increase capital expenditures for new store growth, store renewals and updates, and significantly reduce long term debt. Cash Flow from Operating Activities Continuing Operations The Companys operations are seasonal in nature, with the business depending to a great extent on the last quarter of the year when a significant portion of the sales, profits and positive operating cash flows are realized. Cash requirements are highest in the third quarter as the Company builds inventory levels in preparation for the holiday season. 2007 operating cash flows decreased from recent levels due to the drop in sales volumes that accelerated in the third quarter of 2007 with a weakened consumer spending environment. Based on managements goal of maintaining a strong liquidity position, the Company elected to forgo making a voluntary pension plan contribution in 2007. In 2006, the Company made a $300 million discretionary contribution to its qualified pension plan. The Company did not make a discretionary pension contribution to its qualified pension plan in 2005 due to Internal Revenue Service rules limiting tax deductible contributions. 25 Table of Contents Cash Flow from Investing Activities Continuing Operations Capital expenditures, including capitalized software costs, were $1,243 million, $772 million and $535 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase was principally for new stores, store renewals and modernizations. During 2007, the Company opened 50 new stores, 16 of which were store relocations, and modernized 65 existing stores, as planned. The following provides a breakdown of capital expenditures: ($ in millions) 2007 2006 2005 New and relocated stores $ 687 $ 365 $ 173 Store renewals and updates 389 266 204 Technology and other 167 141 158 Total $ 1,243 $ 772 $ 535 Management expects 2008 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.0 billion. 2008 capital spending will relate principally to new stores and relocations, store renewals and updates, merchandise initiatives, technology and other support projects. The Company currently plans to open 36 new and relocated stores in 2008, of which 32 are expected to be off mall, and to modernize approximately 20 existing stores. Incorporating relocations and store closures, net square footage growth is expected to increase approximately 2.8%. Cash Flow from Financing Activities Continuing Operations During 2007, the Company received $980 million in proceeds from the issuance of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount in new senior notes. Cash payments for long term debt, including capital leases and early retirement premiums, totaled $746 million. In 2006 and 2005, there were no issuances of long term debt, and cash payments for long term debt, including capital leases, totaled $21 million and $474 million, respectively. During 2007, the Company returned $574 million to stockholders through common stock repurchases and dividend payments. The Company repurchased 5.1 million shares of common stock for $400 million during 2007. Common stock was retired on the same day it was repurchased, and the related cash settlements were completed on the third business day following the repurchase. In 2006 and 2005, the Company returned $903 million and $2,383 million, respectively to stockholders through common stock repurchases and dividend payments. Common stock repurchases for 2004 to 2007 are discussed on page 30. JCPenney raised the quarterly dividend on its common stock to $0.20 per share beginning with the May 1, 2007 dividend. The Company paid quarterly dividends of $0.18 per share in 2006 and $0.125 per share in 2005. The Board reviews the dividend policy and rate on a quarterly basis, taking into consideration the overall financial and strategic outlook for the Company, earnings, liquidity and cash flow projections, as well as competitive factors. The Board approves and declares dividends on a quarterly basis. Net proceeds from the exercise of stock options were $45 million in 2007, compared to $135 million in 2006 and $162 million in 2005. Excess tax benefits realized from stock based compensation were $17 million, $39 million and $43 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Cash Flow and Financing Outlook In 2008, the Companys financing strategy will continue to focus on opportunities to deliver value to stockholders, strengthen the financial position and improve the credit profile. The Companys strong 26 Table of Contents financial position provides continued financial flexibility to support the strategic growth objectives. In March 2008, the Board declared a quarterly dividend to be paid on May 1, 2008 of $0.20 per share, unchanged from the prior quarterly dividend declaration. In accordance with its financing strategy, the Company expects to maintain its strong liquidity position. For 2008, the operating and capital expenditure plans have been adjusted to reflect current operating conditions, while maintaining an appropriate balance between long term opportunities for the business and near term economic pressures. The Company expects operating cash flow to decrease slightly in 2008, resulting principally from lower net income expectations. Until all of the Companys credit ratings improve to competitive investment grade levels, access to the capital markets for cash needs will retain an element of uncertainty. As such, management intends to maintain sufficient cash investment levels to ensure support for operational business needs, strategic initiatives, long term debt maturities, dividends and contingency items, such as the opportunistic purchase of selected real estate properties attributable to consolidation within the retail industry. The Company does not expect to borrow under its credit facility except to support ongoing letters of credit. The Company has $200 million of notes scheduled to mature in August 2008. In accordance with its long term financing strategy, the Company manages its financial position on a multi year basis and may access the capital markets opportunistically. The Companys cash flows may be impacted by many factors, including the competitive conditions in the retail industry, the effects of the economic environment and consumer confidence levels. Based on the nature of the Companys business, management considers the above factors to be normal business risks. Inventory Total inventory at year end 2007 was up 7.1% over last year, primarily as a result of the 50 new store openings in 2007, ten stores planned to open in the first quarter of 2008, and inventory to support the February 2008 launch of American Living. On a comparable store basis, inventories were up approximately 2.0% from last year, including inventory for the major launch of American Living, and the continued expansion of Sephora inside JCPenney. Inventory levels were in line with sales trends through the first half of 2007, and subsequently increased in the third and fourth quarters with the downturn in the consumer spending environment. While the negative sales trends contributed to a deceleration in inventory turns in the second half of the year, the Company was successful in clearing fall and holiday merchandise, allowing the Company to be well positioned at the end of 2007 with fresh merchandise for the spring season. Inventory also reflected a good balance between fashion and basic merchandise. Inventory turns for 2007, 2006 and 2005 were 3.14, 3.33 and 3.28, respectively. 27 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Commitments Aggregated information about the Companys obligations and commitments to make future contractual payments, such as debt and lease agreements, and contingent commitments as of February 2, 2008 is presented in the following table. ($ in millions) Total 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 After5 years Recorded contractual obligations: Long term debt, including current maturities and capital leases(1) $ 3,708 $ 203 $ $ 506 $ $ 230 $ 2,769 Trade payables 1,472 1,472 Unrecognized tax benefits(2) 160 49 111 Contributions to non qualified supplemental retirement and postretirement medical plans(3) 326 78 80 25 20 18 105 $ 5,666 $ 1,802 $ 80 $ 531 $ 20 $ 248 $ 2,985 Unrecorded contractual obligations: Interest payments on long term debt and capital leases(4) $ 6,564 $ 260 $ 255 $ 235 $ 215 $ 215 $ 5,384 Operating leases(5) 2,378 250 221 181 152 126 1,448 Standby and import letters of credit( 6) 117 117 Surety bonds(7) 53 53 Contractual obligations(8) 243 151 53 23 13 3 Purchase orders(9) 2,463 2,463 Guarantees(10) 29 3 6 20 $ 11,847 $ 3,297 $ 535 $ 439 $ 380 $ 344 $ 6,852 Total $ 17,513 $ 5,099 $ 615 $ 970 $ 400 $ 592 $ 9,837 (1) The weighted average maturity of the Companys long term debt, excluding current maturities, is 25 years.

Based on the nature of these liabilities, the actual payments in any given year could vary significantly from these amounts. (3) Represents expected payments through 2017. Based on the accounting rules for retirement and postretirement benefit plans, the liabilities reflected in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets differ from these estimated future payments. See Note 16. (4) The 2008 interest payments include $88 million that is reflected in Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet at February 2, 2008. See Note 6. (5) Represents future minimum lease payments for non cancelable operating leases, including renewals determined to be reasonably assured. (6) Standby letters of credit ($108 million) are issued as collateral to a third party administrator for self insured workers compensation and general liability claims. The remaining $9 million are outstanding import letters of credit. (7) Surety bonds are primarily for previously incurred and expensed obligations related to workers compensation and general liability claims.

C. Penney Purchasing Corporation are parties to a five year $1.2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (2005 Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of lenders with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. The 2005 Credit Agreement is available for general corporate purposes, including the issuance of letters of credit. Pricing is tiered based on JCPs senior unsecured long term debt ratings by Moodys and Standard & Poors. JCPs obligations under the 2005 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company. No borrowings, other than the issuance of trade and standby letters of credit, which totaled $117 million as of the end of 2007, have been made under this facility. The 2005 Credit Agreement includes two financial leverage metric covenants, which the Company is required to satisfy, a leverage ratio covenant and a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant. The leverage ratio for 2007 was 1.6 to 1.0, remaining in compliance with the 2005 Credit Agreement covenant requirement of no more than 3.0 to 1.0. The fixed charge coverage ratio for 2007 was 6.5 to 1.0, also remaining in compliance with the 2005 Credit Agreement covenant requirement of at least 3.2 to 1.0. See further discussion in Note 9. Credit Ratings Improvements in the Companys operating performance and financial metrics led to its long term debt credit rating being raised to investment grade level by Fitch in 2005 and by Moodys and Standard & Poors in early 2006. Restoring competitive investment grade credit ratings, consistent with retail industry leaders, continues to be a financial goal for the Company. As of March 17, 2008, the Companys credit ratings and outlook were as follows: Long TermDebt Outlook Moodys Investors Service, Inc. Baa3 Stable Standard & Poors Ratings Services BBB Stable Fitch Ratings BBB Stable The Company maintained its investment grade credit ratings during 2007. In November 2007, Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poors Ratings Services affirmed the Companys long term debt ratings at BBB and BBB , respectively. Both agencies revised their rating outlooks to stable from positive reflecting their opinions that the retail environment will continue to be challenging through 2008 and the expectation that the Companys credit and operating metrics improvement will accordingly take longer than previously anticipated. In February 2008, Moodys affirmed the Companys long term credit rating at Baa3 and changed their rating outlook to stable from positive, citing recent negative comparable store sales and an uncertain overall economic outlook. Going forward, the Company expects that the rating agencies will continue to focus on operating performance consistency, earnings growth and financial leverage as key factors in any ratings decisions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Management considers all on and off balance sheet debt in evaluating the Companys overall liquidity position and capital structure. Other than operating leases, which are included in the Contractual Obligations and Commitments table on page 28, the Company does not have any off balance sheet financing. See detailed disclosure regarding operating leases and their off balance sheet present value in Note 15. 29 Table of Contents As of February 2, 2008, the Company had guarantees of approximately $6 million for certain personal property leases assumed by the purchasers of Eckerd, which were previously reported as operating leases. Currently, management does not believe that any potential financial exposure related to these guarantees would have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. JCP, through JCP Realty, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, has investments in 14 partnerships that own regional mall properties, six as general partner and eight as limited partner. JCPs potential exposure to risk is greater in partnerships in which it is a general partner. Mortgages on the six general partnerships total approximately $348 million; however, the estimated market value of the underlying properties is approximately $881 million. These mortgages are non recourse to JCP, so any financial exposure is minimal. In addition, JCP Realty, Inc. has guaranteed loans totaling approximately $3 million related to an investment in a real estate investment trust. The estimated market value of the underlying properties significantly exceeds the outstanding mortgage loans, and the loan guarantee to market value ratio is 3.3% as of February 2, 2008. In the event of possible default, the creditors would recover first from the proceeds of the sale of the properties, next from the general partner, then from other guarantors before JCPs guarantee would be invoked. As a result, management does not believe that any potential financial exposure related to this guarantee would have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. As part of the 2001 sale of the assets of the Companys Direct Marketing Services subsidiary, JCP signed a guarantee agreement with a maximum exposure of $20 million. Any potential claims or losses are first recovered from established reserves, then from the purchaser and finally from any state insurance guarantee fund before JCPs guarantee would be invoked. As a result, management does not believe that any potential exposure would have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company does not have any additional arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements. Common Stock Repurchases During the 2004 to 2007 period, the Company purchased a combined $5.3 billion of its common stock through open market transactions as follows: (in millions) Shares Cost(1) 2004 50.1 $ 1,951 2005 44.2 2,199 2006 11.3 750 2007 5.1 400 Total 110.7 $ 5,300 (1) Excludes commissions. Of the total repurchases, the Companys Board authorized $3.0 billion in 2004, $1.15 billion in 2005, $750 million in 2006 and $400 million in 2007. In order to fund these programs, the Company used a portion of the $3.5 billion in net cash proceeds from the sale of the Eckerd drugstore operations, $260 million in net cash proceeds from the sale of Renner stock, cash proceeds and tax benefits from the exercise of employee stock options and existing cash and short term investment balances. 30 Table of Contents Common Stock Outstanding During 2005 to 2007, the number of outstanding shares of common stock changed as follows, primarily as a result of common stock repurchases: (in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Balance at beginning of the year 226 233 271 Repurchase and retirement of common stock (5 ) (11 ) (44 ) Exercise of stock options 1 4 6 Balance at end of year 222 226 233 Critical Accounting Policies The application of accounting policies necessarily involves judgment and, in certain instances, the use of estimates and assumptions. Different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Management believes that the accounting policies used to develop estimates that are the most critical to understanding and evaluating the Companys reported results relate to: inventory valuation under the retail method of accounting; valuation of long lived assets; estimation of reserves and valuation allowances, specifically related to closed stores, insurance, income taxes, litigation and environmental contingencies; and pension accounting. Historically, actual results have not differed materially from estimates. The Companys management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board and its independent auditors. The Audit Committee has reviewed the Companys disclosures relating to these policies in this MD&A. For a description of all of the Companys significant accounting policies see Note 1. Inventory Valuation under the Retail Method Inventories are valued primarily at the lower of cost (using the last in, first out or LIFO method) or market, determined by the retail method for department stores and store distribution centers, and standard cost, representing average vendor cost, for Direct and regional warehouses. Under the retail method, retail values are converted to a cost basis by applying specific average cost factors to groupings of merchandise. The retail method inherently requires management judgment and certain estimates that may significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost, as well as gross margin. Two of the most significant estimates are permanent reductions to retail prices (markdowns) used to clear unproductive or slow moving inventory and inventory shortages (shrinkage). Permanent markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded at the point of decision, when the utility of inventory has diminished, versus the point of sale. Factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand, customer preferences, age of the merchandise and style trends. The corresponding reduction to gross margin is recorded in the period the decision is made. Shrinkage is estimated as a percent of sales for the period from the last inventory date to the end of the fiscal period. Physical inventories are taken at least annually and inventory records are adjusted accordingly. The shrinkage rate from the most recent physical inventory, in combination with current events and historical experience, is used as the standard for the shrinkage accrual rate for the next inventory cycle. 31 Table of Contents Management does not believe that the assumptions used in these estimates will change significantly based on prior experience. A 10% increase or decrease in the markdown reserve would have impacted net income by approximately $7 million for the year ended February 2, 2008. A 10% increase or decrease in the estimated inventory shrinkage reserve would have also impacted net income by approximately $7 million for the year ended February 2, 2008. Valuation of Long Lived Assets Management evaluates recoverability of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, for example, when a stores performance falls below minimum Company standards. In the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, management reviews the performance of individual stores. Underperforming stores are selected for further evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying amounts. If the evaluation, done on an undiscounted cash flow basis, indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, the potential impairment is measured as the excess of carrying value over the fair value of the impaired asset. Management estimates fair value based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate that is considered to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the Companys current business model. Additional factors are taken into consideration, such as local market conditions, operating environment, mall performance and other trends. Impairment losses totaling $1 million, $2 million and $7 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, were recorded for underperforming department stores and underutilized Direct and other facilities. If different assumptions were made or different market conditions were present, any estimated potential impairment amounts could vary from recorded amounts. Reserves and Valuation Allowances Based on an overall analysis of store performance and expected trends, management periodically evaluates the need to close underperforming stores. Reserves are established at the point of closure for the present value of any remaining operating lease obligations (PVOL), net of estimated sublease income, and at the point of decision for severance and other exit costs, as prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. See further discussion in Note 1 on page F 14. Two key assumptions in calculating the reserve include the timeframe expected to terminate lease agreements and estimation of other related exit costs. If different assumptions were used regarding the timing and potential termination costs, the resulting reserves could vary from recorded amounts. Reserves are reviewed periodically and adjusted, when necessary. The Company records a provision for workers compensation and general liability risk based on historical experience, current claims data and independent actuarial best estimates, including incurred but not reported claims and projected loss development factors. The Company targets this provision above the midpoint of the actuarial range, and total estimated claim liability amounts are discounted using a risk free rate. Management does not anticipate any significant change in loss trends, settlements or other costs that would cause a significant fluctuation in net income. However, a 10% variance in the workers compensation and general liability reserves would have affected net income by approximately $15 million for the year ended February 2, 2008. Income taxes are estimated for each jurisdiction in which the Company operates. This involves assessing the current tax exposure together with temporary differences, which result from differing 32 Table of Contents treatment of items for tax and book purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are provided for based on these assessments. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for recoverability based on estimated future taxable income. To the extent that recovery is deemed unlikely, a valuation allowance is recorded. During 2005, management determined that the Company will more likely than not generate sufficient income over the next several years to utilize state net operating losses for which a valuation allowance had been recorded. This valuation allowance was appropriately reversed. Effective February 4, 2007, tax contingency accruals are measured and recorded in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASBs) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), which is discussed in Note 1 beginning on page F 10. Previously, such accruals were provided when the Company considered that it was probable that taxes would be due. Tax contingency accruals are evaluated and adjusted as appropriate, while taking into account the progress of audits of various taxing jurisdictions. Management does not expect the outcome of tax audits to have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. Many years of data have been incorporated into the determination of tax reserves, and the Companys estimates have historically been reasonable. The Company is involved in legal proceedings and governmental inquiries associated with employment and other matters. Reserves have been established based on managements best estimates of the Companys potential liability in these matters. These estimates have been developed in consultation with in house and outside counsel. Management does not believe that these proceedings and inquiries, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. See further discussion in Note 19. As of February 2, 2008, the Company estimated its total potential environmental liabilities to range from $38 million to $49 million and recorded managements best estimate of $43 million in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of that date. This estimate covered potential liabilities primarily related to underground storage tanks, remediation of environmental conditions involving the Companys former Eckerd drugstore locations, and asbestos removal in connection with approved plans to renovate or dispose of Company facilities. Even if the Company were to incur losses at the upper end of the estimated range, management does not believe that such losses would have a material effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. In establishing its reserves for liabilities associated with underground storage tanks, the Company maintains and periodically updates an inventory listing of potentially impacted sites. The estimated cost of remediation efforts is based on the Companys historical experience as well as industry and other published data. With respect to its former Eckerd operations, the Company accessed extensive databases of environmental matters, including data from the Environmental Protection Agency, to estimate the cost of remediation. The experience of the Company, as well as relevant data, was used to develop a range of potential liabilities, and a reserve was established at the time of the Eckerd sale. The Eckerd reserve is adjusted as payments are made or new information becomes known. Reserves for asbestos removal are based on the Companys known liabilities in connection with approved plans for store modernization, renovations, or dispositions of store locations. Management believes the established reserves, as adjusted, are adequate to cover estimated potential liabilities. 33 Table of Contents Pension Pension Accounting Effective January 1, 2007, the Company implemented certain changes to its retirement benefits, most notably the closing of the pension plan to new hires, with a replacement benefit of 2% of pay, a component of the defined contribution 401(k) plan. Associates hired or rehired on or prior to December 31, 2006 will remain in the Companys pension plan and continue to earn credited service. In addition, the Company now matches 50 cents on each dollar contributed up to 6% of pay to the Companys 401(k) defined contribution plan, replacing the previous Company match of 4.5% of available profits. As of February 3, 2007, the Company adopted the recognition provisions of SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) (SFAS 158). Refer to Note 16 for a discussion of the impact of adopting SFAS 158. The provision of SFAS 158 that will require companies to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the Companys fiscal year end will become effective in 2008. The Company currently uses a measurement date of October 31 for its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans; therefore, it will transition to a fiscal year end measurement date using the first approach prescribed by paragraph 18 of SFAS 158 whereby a new measurement of plan assets and benefit obligations was completed as of the beginning of 2008. Accordingly, in the first quarter of 2008, the Company will record a transition adjustment of approximately $42 million (increase) to the opening retained earnings balance to recognize the net periodic benefit income for the period between October 31, 2007 and February 2, 2008. In addition, to reflect the changes in the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation that occurred during the transition period from October 31, 2007 to February 2, 2008, which included an increase in the discount rate from 6.46% to 6.54% as of February 2, 2008, the Company will record a decrease of $343 million to the 2008 opening balance of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. Major assumptions used in accounting for retirement plans include the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate. Assumptions are determined based on Company information and market indicators and are evaluated at each annual measurement date. A change in any of these assumptions could have a significant effect on the Companys pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs. These assumptions require significant judgment, and the calculation of pension costs is relatively complex. The following discussion relates to the primary pension plan only, since it represents the majority of the Companys recorded pension expense or income and related asset/liability amounts in its consolidated financial statements. Return on Plan Assets and Impact on Earnings ($ in millions) 2007 2006 2005 One year actual return on plan assets 19.1% 17.6% 13.2% Expected return on plan assets assumption 8.9% 8.9% 8.9% Pension (income)/expense $ (97) $ 9 $ 69 The Company uses fair value, which is the market value of plan assets as of the annual measurement date, to calculate the expected return on assets and gain/loss amortization components of net periodic pension expense. As a result of strong asset performance over the past few years, combined with voluntary Company contributions totaling $1.2 billion pre tax from 2002 through 2006, pension expense has decreased each year since 2003. 34 Table of Contents Since the inception of the Companys primary pension plan in 1966 through the October 31, 2007 measurement date, the average annual return has been 9.9%. From 2000 2002, stock market returns were negative and led to a decline in the fair value of pension assets. During the last five years pension assets have experienced significant increases due to consecutive annual gains in global equity markets. Since inception, the Companys primary pension plan has incurred cumulative pre tax expense of approximately $95 million. This is the result of cumulative pension expense during the 1966 1984 period of $366 million, cumulative pension income during the 1985 2001 period of $488 million, cumulative pension expense in the 2002 2006 period totaling $314 million and pension income of $97 million in 2007. The Company has maintained an expected rate of return of 8.9% over the last four years, consistent with historical returns and managements long term view of expected returns. Pension income, which is a non cash item, will increase in 2008 by approximately $30 million primarily as a result of 2007 positive return on plan assets. To develop its expected return on plan assets, the Company considers its long term asset allocation policy, historical returns on plan assets and overall capital market returns, taking into account current and expected market conditions. The Companys primary pension plan is well diversified with an asset allocation policy that provides for a targeted 70%, 20% and 10% mix of equities (U.S., non U.S. and private), fixed income (investment grade and high yield) and real estate (private and public), respectively. This allocation provides the pension plan with the appropriate balance of investment return and volatility risk, given the funded nature of the plan, its present and future liability characteristics and its long term investment horizon. With the recent downturn in the mortgage security market, management evaluated the pension plans investment portfolio and determined that exposure to sub prime mortgage backed securities was less than one percent of the total asset portfolio as of the measurement date. See Note 16 for a further discussion of the asset allocation strategy for plan assets. Discount Rate 2007 2006 2005 Discount rate for pension expense 5.85% 5.80% 5.85% Discount rate for pension obligation 6.46% 5.85% 5.80% The Company increased the discount rate used to measure the pension obligation from 5.85% to 6.46% in 2007. At October 31, 2007, the discount rate assumption used to determine the Companys postretirement obligations was based on an externally published yield curve, which is determined by the plans actuary. The yield curve is a hypothetical AA yield curve represented by a series of bonds maturing from 6 months to 30 years, designed to match the corresponding pension benefit cash payments to retirees. Each underlying bond issue is required to have a rating of Aa2 or better by Moodys Investor Services, Inc. or a rating of AA or better by Standard & Poors. Prior to 2007, the discount rate assumption was based on the yield to maturity of a representative portfolio of AA rated corporate bonds as of the October 31 measurement date each year, with an average cash flow duration similar to the pension liability. Both methodologies are consistent with guidance in SFAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, to use the rate currently available on high quality bonds and the subsequent guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission that high quality bonds should be those with at least a AA rating by a recognized rating agency. The change to the yield curve methodology for estimating the discount rate had no material impact on the pension plan liability or pension expense/(income). 35 Table of Contents Sensitivity The sensitivity of the pension expense to a plus or minus one half of one percent of expected return on assets is a decrease or increase in expense of approximately $0.08 per share. An increase or decrease in the discount rate of one half of one percent would decrease or increase the expense by approximately $0.01 per share. Pension Funding Funding Policy and Status The Companys funding policy is to maintain a well funded pension plan throughout all business and economic cycles. Maintaining a well funded plan over time provides additional financial flexibility to the Company, including lower pension expense and reduced cash contributions, especially in the event of a decline in the capital markets. In addition, a well funded plan assures associates of the plans and the Companys financial ability to continue to provide competitive retirement benefits, while at the same time being cost effective. The Company targets an ongoing funded ratio, which is the plans assets as a percent of the actuarial funding liability under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), in the range of 120% to 150%. At October 31, 2007, plan assets of $5.8 billion were 145% of the $4.0 billion ERISA funding liability. The Pension Protection Act (PPA), a 2006 amendment to ERISA, increases the limit on maximum deductible contributions from 100% of the actuarial funding liability to 150%. Increasing the funding limit provides the Company enhanced flexibility to make discretionary pension contributions and to maintain the plans funded ratio within the funding policy target range. Funding History The Company made cash contributions to its primary pension plan annually during the 1966 1983 period in order to provide an asset base to support the accelerating liability growth in the early years of the plan. Over the 1984 2007 period, the Company made cash contributions to the plan in eight years (1993 1996, 2002 2004, 2006) and no contributions in the other 16 years due to maintaining a well funded plan and the actual investment return on plan assets. Since the plans inception, the Company has contributed $2.0 billion, or approximately $1.2 billion on an after tax basis, to its primary pension plan. Over this timeframe, the actual investment return on plan assets has generated a significant portion of the $8.5 billion in pension plan total value, defined as $3.3 billion in cumulative benefit payments to retired associates plus $5.2 billion in plan assets as of fiscal year end 2007. In effect, the Companys cumulative after tax cash contributions over this timeframe represent approximately 14% of the plans total value (i.e., $1.2 billion as a percent of $8.5 billion). The remainder of the plans total value has been generated by the actual investment returns since inception. Accounting for Stock Based Compensation The Company has a stock based compensation plan for approximately 1,800 executives and senior management that provides for grants to associates of stock awards (stock or units, restricted or unrestricted), stock appreciation rights or options to purchase the Companys common stock. Over the past three years, the Companys annual stock option and restricted stock award grants have averaged about 1.2% of outstanding shares. As of February 2, 2008, options to purchase 8.2 million 36 Table of Contents shares of common stock, representing 3.7% of total shares, were outstanding, of which 5.1 million were exercisable. Of the exercisable options, 77% were in the money, or had an exercise price below the closing end of year stock price of $48.50. Stock Based Compensation Cost ($ in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Stock awards (shares and units) $ 22 $ 34 $ 6 Stock options 23 26 32 Total stock based compensation cost $ 45 $ 60 $ 38 Total income tax benefit recognized for stock based compensation arrangements $ 18 $ 23 $ 15 The Company estimates the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using a binomial lattice model. The Company believes that the binomial lattice model is a more accurate model for valuing employee stock options since it better reflects the impact of stock price changes on option exercise behavior. The expected volatility used in the binomial lattice model is based on an analysis of historical prices of JCPenneys stock and open market exchanged options. The expected volatility reflects the volatility implied from a price quoted for a hypothetical call option with a duration consistent with the expected life of the options and the volatility implied by the trading of options to purchase the Companys stock on open market exchanges. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the binomial lattice model, and represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding. This model incorporates an early exercise assumption in the event of a significant increase in stock price. The risk free rate is based on zero coupon U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the date of grant with the same period as the expected option life. For 2007, the dividend yield is based on the stock price at option date and the current dividend level with no assumed future increases. As of February 2, 2008, there was $30 million and $22 million of compensation cost not yet recognized or earned related to stock options and non vested restricted stock (share and unit) awards, respectively, which is expected to be recognized as earned over weighted average periods of 1.0 and 1.4 years, respectively. See Notes 1 and 14 for more details about the Companys stock based compensation. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2007, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 06 11, Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share Based Payment Awards. EITF Issue No. 06 11 provides guidance regarding how an entity should recognize the tax benefit received as a result of dividends paid to holders of share based compensation awards and charged to retained earnings according to SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment, and will become effective in the first quarter of 2008. Management does not expect EITF Issue No. 06 11 to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. 37 Table of Contents In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities. SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. If the fair value option is elected, unrealized gains and losses will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The adoption of SFAS 159 at the beginning of fiscal 2008 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157, Fair Value Measurements. This Standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, but does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 for financial assets and liabilities, as well as for any other assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis in financial statements. In November 2007, the FASB provided a one year deferral for the implementation of SFAS 157 for other nonfinancial assets and liabilities. The adoption of the applicable provisions of SFAS 157 at the beginning of fiscal 2008 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements, and as it relates to nonfinancial assets and liabilities, the Statement is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information This Annual Report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements made within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which reflect the Companys current view of future events and financial performance. The words expect, plan, anticipate, believe, intend, should, will and similar expressions identify forward looking statements. Any such forward looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause the Companys actual results to be materially different from planned or expected results. Those risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions, including inflation, recession, consumer spending patterns and debt levels, the cost of goods, trade restrictions, changes in tariff, freight, paper and postal rates, changes in cost of fuel and other energy and transportation costs, competition and retail industry consolidations, interest rate fluctuations, dollar and other currency valuations, risks associated with war, an act of terrorism or pandemic, and a systems failure and or security breach that results in the theft, transfer or unauthorized disclosure of customer, employee or Company information. Furthermore, the Company typically earns a disproportionate share of its operating income in the fourth quarter due to holiday buying patterns, and such buying patterns are difficult to forecast with certainty. While the Company believes that its assumptions are reasonable, it cautions that it is impossible to predict the degree to which any such factors could cause actual results to differ materially from predicted results. For additional discussion on risks and uncertainties, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, beginning on page 4. The Company intends the forward looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K to speak only as of the date of this report and does not undertake to update or revise these projections as more information becomes available. 38 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The Company maintains a majority of its cash and short term investments in financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less. Such investments are subject to interest rate risk and may have a small decline in value if interest rates increase. Since the financial instruments are of short duration, a change of 100 basis points in interest rates would not have a material effect on the Companys financial condition. All of the Companys outstanding long term debt as of February 2, 2008 is at fixed interest rates and would not be affected by interest rate changes. Future borrowings under the Companys multi year revolving credit facility, to the extent that fluctuating rate loans were used, would be affected by interest rate changes. As of February 2, 2008, no cash borrowings were outstanding under the facility, and approximately $117 million in letters of credit were supported by this facility. The Company does not believe that a change of 100 basis points in interest rates would have a material effect on the Companys financial condition. The fair value of long term debt is estimated by obtaining quotes from brokers or is based on current rates offered for similar debt. At February 2, 2008, long term debt, excluding equipment financing, capital leases and other, had a carrying value of $3.7 billion and a fair value of $3.6 billion. At February 3, 2007, long term debt, excluding equipment financing, capital leases and other, had a carrying value of $3.4 billion and a fair value of $3.6 billion. The effects of changes in the U.S. equity and bond markets serve to increase or decrease the value of assets in the Companys qualified pension plan, which is well funded. At the October 31, 2007 measurement date, plan assets of $5.8 billion were approximately 145% of the $4.0 billion actuarial funding liability under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). The Company seeks to manage exposure to adverse equity and bond returns by maintaining diversified investment portfolios and utilizing professional investment managers.
