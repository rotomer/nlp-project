Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion, which presents our results, should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto beginning on page F 3, along with the unaudited Five Year Financial and Operations Summaries on pages 11 and 12, the risk factors beginning on page 4 and the cautionary statement regarding forward looking information on page 39. Unless otherwise indicated, this Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) relates only to results from continuing operations, all references to earnings per share (EPS) are on a diluted basis and all references to years relate to fiscal years rather than to calendar years. Fiscal 2008 and 2007 each contained 52 weeks, while 2006 contained 53 weeks. Corporate Governance and Financial Reporting We remain committed to maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance and continuously improving the transparency of our financial reporting by providing stockholders with informative financial disclosures and presenting a clear and balanced view of our financial position and operating results. We continue to employ a reporting matrix that requires written certifications on a quarterly basis from a cross disciplined team of approximately 20 senior members of our management team who have responsibility for preparing, verifying and reporting corporate results. For this Annual Report on Form 10 K, we made further enhancements to our financial reporting with expanded disclosures in several areas, such as: reordered the sequence of MD&A to present a better flow of information; included in the discussion of gross margin and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses a description of the key components; added a liquidity table to facilitate the discussion of financial condition and liquidity; added pension expense as a separate line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations to enhance and clarify disclosures regarding pension expense; added clarity to the balance sheet by reclassifying income taxes receivable to a separate line item and credit card transactions awaiting settlements to cash and cash equivalents, which were formerly included in the receivables line item; and changed the balance sheet line item cash and short term investments to cash and cash equivalents, which is more representative of its components. Consistent with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting each fiscal year. In relation to these requirements, our external auditors expressed an unqualified opinion regarding the effective operation of our internal control over financial reporting. Executive Overview The fourth quarter of 2008 marked the sixth consecutive quarter in which our results of operations were negatively impacted by the weakened economic environment. For the full year of 2008, we experienced a decline in comparable store sales of 8.5%. While comparable store sales were down 5.8% during the first half of the year, they decreased sharply by 10.5% during the second half of the year, indicating a further decline in consumer confidence that reached new lows when the economic downturn became a global economic crisis. Income from continuing operations for 2008 decreased 13 Table of Contents 48.7% to $567 million. Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $2.54 for 2008 compared to $4.90 for 2007. Operating income was $1,135 million, or 6.1% of sales, versus $1,888 million, or 9.5% of sales, in 2007. To enhance our liquidity position and ensure we maintain a strong financial position, we addressed these difficult operating conditions by focusing on those areas within our control, specifically by reducing inventory and tightly controlling operating expenses. As a result of our efforts, we finished the year with approximately $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet. Our strong liquidity and solid financial position allow us to focus our efforts on appropriately managing inventory levels, operating expenses and capital expenditures under our Bridge Plan without the need for substantial changes to our business model. A significant accomplishment and indication of our solid financial position is shown by our free cash flow (a non GAAP financial measure defined and discussed on page 28), which provided a positive $21 million despite the harsh economic conditions. 2008 Key Items The difficult economic environment impacting consumers continued to deteriorate in 2008 and included a further pronounced slowdown in consumer spending levels during the second half of the year. Tightening credit availability, the downturn of the housing and real estate market, rising unemployment and turmoil in the global capital markets weighed heavily on the consumer. Lower consumer spending and declining mall traffic impacted our sales. However, despite the challenging environment, we continued to focus on managing inventory and controlling operating expenses. At the same time, we continued to execute initiatives to deliver on the value proposition that our customers have come to expect from JCPenney through newness in merchandise, competitive pricing, enhanced customer service and convenience of shopping in stores, catalog and jcp.com. Despite the economic conditions, during 2008 we generated $21 million of positive free cash flow (a non GAAP financial measure defined and discussed on page 28). This represents a $163 million improvement over 2007. Comparable store inventory as of the end of 2008 decreased 13.5% from the prior year as a result of significant actions to lower merchandise receipts and increased clearance activity. Merchandise inventory at the end of 2008 was in alignment with sales trends expected for the near term. SG&A expenses decreased $7 million, or 0.1%, in 2008 as compared to 2007, despite the incremental expenses associated with 35 new stores (26 net of closings and relocations). SG&A expenses for 2008 were well managed across the organization without compromising the customer shopping experience. In 2008, we opened 35 new and relocated stores, including 31 in the off mall format. Net of relocations and store closings, gross selling space increased 3.0%. We also opened 44 new Sephora inside JCPenney locations during the year, which brought the total to 91 locations. Sephora inside JCPenney brings an industry leading beauty concept to JCPenney customers and continues to be one of the strongest areas of our business. Current Developments In March 2009, our Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share to be paid to stockholders on May 1, 2009. The dividend rate remains unchanged from our previous quarterly dividend payment. In March 2009, we opened nine new stores, including one relocation. We also opened 14 additional Sephora inside JCPenney locations, including nine in the new stores and five in 14 Table of Contents existing stores, bringing our total Sephora inside JCPenney locations to 105. We expect to add 50 Sephora inside JCPenney locations during the remainder of 2009, bringing our total to 155 at the end of 2009. In February 2009, we launched our spring marketing campaign showcasing our compelling selection of affordable, exclusive designer brands. The campaign kicked off with commercials at the 2009 Academy Awards featuring several authentic designers from our portfolio, including nicole&reg; by Nicole Miller, Bisou Bisou&reg; by Michele Bohbot, ALLEN B.&reg; by Allen B. Schwartz, Fabulosity by Kimora Lee Simmons and I Heart Ronson by Charlotte Ronson. Our spring campaign reflects our success as we are stepping up our style in delivering brands that inspire and enable customers to have exceptional style and quality at affordable prices. In February 2009, we launched an interactive, fully integrated, virtual runway show on jcp.com featuring spring styles from our compelling selection of affordable exclusive designer brands, including nicole&reg; by Nicole Miller, Bisou Bisou&reg; by Michele Bohbot, ALLEN B.&reg; by Allen B. Schwartz and I Heart Ronson by Charlotte Ronson. The online experience gives our customers the opportunity to experience a dynamic runway show, complete with high energy music and 360 degree views of models in styles from each designers collection. The experience also includes video vignettes of our design partners sharing the inspiration behind their new collections along with their views on upcoming styles for spring. Also in February 2009, we announced our official sponsorship of the Rascal Flatts American Living Unstoppable Tour presented by JCPenney. The tour will promote American Living, an affordable, all American lifestyle brand developed exclusively for our customers by Polo Ralph Laurens Global Brand Concepts with offerings across 40 merchandise categories. Representing true Americana, Rascal Flatts music transcends genres and resonates strongly with many of our customers. The fully integrated two year sponsorship will kick off in early June 2009, with the tour hitting about 60 cities across the nation each year. In conjunction with the tour, Rascal Flatts has written a new song inspired by the spirit of the brand titled American Living, which will serve as the soundtrack for our new American Living commercial and will be available in our stores. In March 2009, we were recognized for our continued commitment to strategic energy management by the U.S. Department of Energy with the ENERGY STAR Award for Sustained Excellence in Energy Management. We are the first retailer to be honored with this award for our efforts in using energy efficiently in facility operations and integrating superior energy management into our overall organization strategy. We were selected from more than 12,000 organizations that participate in the ENERGY STAR program. 15 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis, consistent with all other financial data throughout this Annual Report on Form 10 K, focuses on the results of operations and financial condition from our continuing operations. Three Year Comparison of Operating Performance ($ in millions, except EPS) 2008 2007 2006 Total net sales $ 18,486 $ 19,860 $ 19,903 Percent (decrease)/increase from prior year (6.9 )% (0.2 )%(1) 6.0 %(1) Comparable store sales (decrease)/increase(2) (8.5 )% 0.0 % 4.9 % Gross margin 6,915 7,671 7,825 Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) 5,395 5,402 5,470 Pension (income)/expense (90 ) (45 ) 51 Depreciation and amortization 469 426 389 Pre opening 31 46 27 Real estate and other (income), net (25 ) (46 ) (34 ) Total operating expenses 5,780 5,783 5,903 Operating income 1,135 1,888 1,922 As a percent of sales 6.1 % 9.5 % 9.7 % Net interest expense 225 153 130 Bond premiums and unamortized costs 12 Income from continuing operations before income taxes 910 1,723 1,792 Income tax expense 343 618 658 Income from continuing operations $ 567 $ 1,105 $ 1,134 Diluted EPS from continuing operations $ 2.54 $ 4.90 $ 4.88 (1) 2006 contained 53 weeks. Total net sales percent includes the effect of the 53rd week in 2006. Excluding sales of $254 million for the 53rd week in 2006, total net sales increased 1.1% and 4.6% for 2007 and 2006, respectively. (2) Comparable store sales are presented on a 52 week basis and include sales from new and relocated stores that have been opened for 12 consecutive full fiscal months and online sales through jcp.com. Stores closed for an extended period are not included in comparable store sales calculations, while stores remodeled and minor expansions not requiring store closures remain in the calculations. Income from continuing operations was $567 million in 2008, compared to $1,105 million in 2007 and $1,134 million in 2006. Our 2008 results were impacted by pressure on gross margins in a highly promotional selling environment, particularly during the holiday season. Gross margin declined both in dollars and as a percentage of sales from the pressure of declining sales levels that resulted from the slowdown in consumer spending. The impact on operating income from lower gross margin was somewhat mitigated by effective control over operating expenses, despite incremental expenses related to new store openings. EPS from continuing operations in 2008 was $2.54, compared to $4.90 in 2007 and $4.88 in 2006. EPS in 2007 benefited from the reduction in average shares outstanding compared to the prior year due to the 2007 and 2006 common stock repurchase programs. Additionally, the 2007 results reflected tax credits of $38 million, or $0.17 per share, while 2006 results reflected a tax credit of $32 million, or 16 Table of Contents $0.14 per share, both of which were due to the release of income tax reserves resulting from the favorable resolution of prior year tax matters. Our 2007 results were impacted by gross margin pressure from the onset of the economic downturn that began in the second half of the year. Our 2006 earnings increased as a result of strong sales and gross margin improvement, combined with lower interest expense and bond premiums. 2008 Compared to 2007 Total Net Sales Our year to year change in total net sales is comprised of (a) sales from new stores net of closings and relocations including catalog print media and outlet store sales, referred to as non comparable store sales and (b) sales of stores opened in both years as well as online sales from jcp.com, referred to as comparable store sales. We consider comparable store sales to be a key indicator of our current performance measuring the growth in sales and sales productivity of existing stores. Positive comparable store sales contribute to greater leveraging of operating costs, particularly payroll and occupancy costs, while negative comparable store sales contribute to de leveraging of costs. Comparable store sales also have a direct impact on our total net sales and the level of cash flow. ($ in millions) 2008 2007 Total net sales $ 18,486 $ 19,860 Sales percent (decrease)/increase Total net sales (6.9 )% (0.2 )% Comparable store sales (8.5 )% 0.0 % Sales per gross square foot(1) $ 160 $ 177 (1) Calculation includes the sales of stores that were open for the full fiscal year as of each year end, as well as online sales from jcp.com. Total net sales in 2008 decreased $1,374 million as a result of a sharp slow down in consumer spending. The decline was mainly attributed to a comparable store sales decline of 8.5% and a decrease, as expected, in catalog print media and outlet store sales in our Direct channel. While comparable store sales decreased, sales from non comparable stores opened in 2008 and 2007, net of closings, added $434 million. In 2008, we opened 26 net new stores (35 stores, net of 9 closings and relocations) and in 2007 we opened 34 net new stores (50 stores, net of 16 closings and relocations.) Over the course of 2008, the worsening consumer spending environment resulted in reduced sales from lower traffic in our mall stores, which decreased 5.4% from prior year traffic levels. Our off mall traffic was also down compared to last year but had stronger traffic trends than our mall stores. Consistent with the difficult retail environment and the pronounced decrease in consumer spending, the number of transactions and the number of units sold declined for the year. Geographically, the best performing regions for the year were the central and northwest regions, while the southeast and southwest regions, which were more heavily impacted by declining home values, delivered the weakest performance. Sales of jcp.com, which are included in comparable stores sales, were essentially flat with last year at about $1.5 billion. Although consumer spending steadily decreased over the year, we continued our leadership position in apparel, bringing style and newness through the launch of several private and exclusive brands. For the year, family shoes, along with womens apparel and accessories were the best performing divisions. By contrast, and consistent with industry results, fine jewelry and home were the weakest businesses. 17 Table of Contents Private and exclusive brands found only at JCPenney totaled approximately 52% and 49% of total merchandise sales for 2008 and 2007, respectively. Total Net Sales Mix The following percentages represent the mix of total net sales: 2008 2007 Womens apparel 24 % 23 % Home 20 % 21 % Mens apparel and accessories 19 % 20 % Childrens apparel 11 % 11 % Womens accessories 10 % 9 % Family footwear 6 % 6 % Fine jewelry 5 % 5 % Services and other 5 % 5 % 100 % 100 % Merchandise Initiatives We remain committed to offering our customers compelling merchandise with the combination of style, quality and smart prices that they desire. In February 2008, we launched American Living, a new updated traditional lifestyle brand created exclusively for JCPenney by Polo Ralph Laurens Global Brand Concepts. American Living is in the higher quality and pricing segment of our offerings across 40 merchandise categories for women, men and children, as well as shoes, accessories and home goods. In April 2008, we launched Linden Street, which was the most comprehensive home brand launch in our history. It is a blend of traditional and contemporary styles offering a classic, timeless design. For the Back to School season, in juniors, we launched private brand Decree&reg;, a denim inspired line of apparel for girls and young women, and two new exclusive brands: LeTigre from Kenneth Cole Productions and Fabulosity, a complete line of sportswear designed by Kimora Lee Simmons. For young mens, we extended the exclusive American Living brand with new denim, graphic t shirts and jackets, and launched White Tag, a new urban rock inspired national brand of premium denim and art driven t shirts. In addition to the new fashion brands for Back to School, we introduced Dorm Life, a new private modern lifestyle brand in the home division featuring merchandise to furnish a college dorm or off campus housing. In October 2008, we announced the significant enhancement of the longstanding and highly successful career brands Worthington&reg; for women and Stafford&reg; for men, to retain longtime customers and to attract new shoppers. We updated the private brands with new categories, fits and fabrics that overlap seasons. Also in October 2008, we announced the spring 2009 launches of two new exclusive designer brands, I Heart Ronson, a complete womens fashion sportswear line designed by Charlotte Ronson, an innovator in the fashion industry; and ALLEN B.&reg;, a complete womens fashion sportswear and dress collection by Allen B. Schwartz, a designer with talent in bringing the latest trends to market in record time. I Heart Ronson and ALLEN B.&reg; are exciting additions to our growing portfolio of exclusive designer brands, which continue to offer our customers coveted designer brands at smart prices. 18 Table of Contents Marketing Initiatives In July and November 2008, we supported the apparel launches with integrated marketing campaigns featuring the new brands. The campaigns targeted teens and included both traditional ads and non traditional media components, such as in cinema ads and mobile phone marketing, emails, web search and targeted direct mail and catalog. The messages were coordinated across all lines of the business, stores and Direct that represent an alignment of our offerings and provide a seamless shopping experience for customers. Customer Service Initiatives During 2008, store associates participated in CustomerFIRST, a training program focused on delivering extraordinary customer service that empowers associates to exceed customers expectations when they shop at our stores. Results of the CustomerFIRST program have been positive. Based on consumer research, customers rank us number one when asked about customer service, sales associate availability and whether they are treated with respect by sales associates. In January 2009, the National Retail Federation (NRF) Foundation/American Express 2008 Customer Service Survey, which placed us first in customer service among department store retailers, confirmed our leading customer service ranking and improved our overall ranking by five spots to seventh place. Gross Margin Gross margin is a measure of profitability of a retail company at the most fundamental level of buying and selling merchandise and measures a companys ability to effectively manage the total costs of sourcing and allocating merchandise against the corresponding retail pricing designed to offer quality merchandise at smart prices. Gross margins not only cover marketing, selling and other operating expenses, but also must include a profit element to reinvest back into the business. Gross margin is the difference between total net sales and cost of the merchandise sold and is typically expressed as a percentage of total net sales. The cost of merchandise sold includes all direct costs of bringing merchandise to its final selling destination. These costs include: cost of the merchandise (net of discounts or allowances earned) freight warehousing sourcing and procurement buying and brand development costs including buyers salaries and related expenses merchandise examination inspection and testing store merchandise distribution center expenses shipping and handling costs incurred related to direct sales to customers ($ in millions) 2008 2007 First in first out (FIFO) gross margin $ 6,916 $ 7,664 Last in first out (LIFO) (charge)/credit (1 ) 7 Gross margin $ 6,915 $ 7,671 As a percent of sales 37.4 % 38.6 % Gross margin declined by $756 million, or 120 basis points as a percentage of sales in 2008. The decline was a result of a decrease in unit sales, as well as a decrease in average unit retail. The lower average unit retail reflected higher markdowns from increased clearance activity in response to softer sales and to achieve desired levels of inventory. 19 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses The following costs are included in SG&A expenses except if related to merchandise buying, sourcing, warehousing or distribution activities: salaries marketing occupancy and rent utilities and maintenance information technology administrative costs related to our home office, district and regional operations credit card fees real, personal property and other taxes (excluding income taxes) ($ in millions) 2008 2007 SG&A $ 5,395 $ 5,402 As a percent of sales 29.2 % 27.2 % SG&A expenses were well managed across the entire organization in 2008, decreasing $7 million despite the addition of 26 net new stores since last year. In 2008, we realized the first full year of benefit from our workforce management tool that facilitates efficient staffing levels. The rollout of this tool provided a positive impact on associate productivity, as well as stores payroll expense. Store salaries declined on a dollar basis, but were not leveraged against sales and increased about 40 basis points as a percent of sales. Total marketing costs were slightly under the prior year, but as a percent of sales increased 50 basis points. Likewise, store occupancy and utility expenses were also well managed, but were up about 50 basis points. Total SG&A expenses as a percent of sales experienced approximately 200 basis points of de leveraging as a result of the sales decline. During 2008 and 2007, advertising allowances that offset gross advertising expense were $167 million and $210 million, respectively. The year over year decrease was primarily due to lower merchandise receipts. Pension (Income)/Expense Pension income doubled to $90 million in 2008 from $45 million in the prior year primarily from the pension credit from our qualified pension plan (primary plan), which is a defined benefit funded plan. The net pension income of $90 million is comprised of the qualified pension plan income of $133 million and pension expense of $43 million from the defined benefit supplemental pension plans, which are unfunded. Our 2008 pension income was measured on February 3, 2008, in accordance with the adoption of the measurement date provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans. The primary driver of the 2008 pension income was the result of strong capital market returns associated with the primary plan assets. Depreciation and Amortization Expenses Depreciation and amortization expenses in 2008 increased to $469 million, or approximately 40 basis points as a percent of sales, reflecting new store openings and store renovations. Pre Opening Expense Pre opening expense includes advertising, hiring and training costs for new associates, processing and stocking initial merchandise inventory and rental costs prior to store opening. During 2008, we opened 35 new stores compared to 50 in 2007. As a result, pre opening expense decreased to $31 million from $46 million. 20 Table of Contents Real Estate and Other (Income), Net ($ in millions) 2008 2007 Real estate activities $ (39) $ (39) Net gains from sale of real estate (10) (10) Other 24 3 Total $ (25) $ (46) Real estate and other consists primarily of ongoing operating income from our real estate subsidiaries, as well as net gains from the sale of facilities and equipment that are no longer used in our operations, other non operating corporate charges and credits and asset impairments. Real estate and other was a net credit of $25 million in 2008 and decreased $21 million compared to 2007. The decline was primarily a result of impairments related to a department store, a real estate joint venture and other corporate assets. In addition to ongoing operating income from real estate subsidiaries, 2008 included net gains of $10 million from the sale of non operating real estate properties, comparable to the prior year. Operating Income Operating income decreased $753 million, or 340 basis points as a percent of sales, reflecting pressure from the weak sales environment and increased promotional levels throughout the year and holiday season. Operating income is the key measurement management uses to evaluate the financial performance of our retail operations. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense consists principally of interest expense on long term debt, net of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents. Net interest expense was $225 million, an increase of $72 million, or 47.1%, from 2007. The increase in net interest expense was due primarily to a decrease in the weighted average annual interest rate earned on short term investment balances to 1.6% in 2008 from 5.0% in 2007, combined with a decrease in average outstanding short term investments. Interest income on short term investments was $32 million in 2008 compared to $113 million in 2007. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate for continuing operations for 2008 was 37.7% compared with 35.9% for 2007. The 2007 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the release of $38 million, or $0.17 per share, of income tax reserves resulting from the favorable resolution of prior year tax matters. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations in 2008 was a credit of $5 million, or $0.03 per share, compared to $6 million, or $0.03 per share in 2007, and was primarily the result of our ongoing review and true up of reserves related to previous discontinued operations. These previous discontinued operations are no longer expected to have a future material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 21 Table of Contents 2007 Compared to 2006 Total Net Sales ($ in millions) 2007 2006 Total net sales $ 19,860 $ 19,903 Sales percent (decrease)/increase Total net sales (0.2 )%(1) 6.0 %(1) Comparable store sales 0.0 % 4.9 % Sales per gross square foot(2) $ 177 $ 176 (1) Includes the effect of the 53rd week in 2006. Excluding sales of $254 million for the 53rd week in 2006, total net sales increased 1.1% and 4.6% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. (2) Calculation includes the sales of stores that were open for the full fiscal year as of each year end, as well as online sales from jcp.com. The 2006 calculation excludes sales of the 53rd week. Total net sales decreased $43 million, or 0.2%, in 2007, primarily as a result of the 53rd week in 2006 and the expected decline in catalog print media and outlet store sales. Excluding sales of $254 million for the 53rd week of 2006, total net sales increased 1.1%. Comparable store sales, including online sales, were flat with 2006. Sales from non comparable stores opened in 2007 and 2006, net of closings, were $456 million. In 2007, we opened 34 net new stores (50 stores, net of 16 closings and relocations) and in 2006 we opened 14 net new stores (28 stores, net of 14 closings and relocations.) Comparable store sales were negatively impacted by a decline in JCPenney mall store traffic of approximately 4%, consistent with overall mall traffic trends, while the average unit retail and the number of transactions remained at comparable levels to the prior year. Although sales were soft across most merchandise categories, our best performing categories were womens and childrens apparel. The weakest sales results were in most home categories, mens and fine jewelry. Geographically, the western regions reported sales gains during 2007, while decreases were reported in the eastern and central regions of the country. Private and exclusive brands found only at JCPenney totaled approximately 49% and 48% of total merchandise sales for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Total Net Sales Mix The following percentages represent the mix of total net sales: 2007 2006 Womens apparel 23 % 22 % Home 21 % 21 % Mens apparel and accessories 20 % 20 % Childrens apparel 11 % 11 % Womens accessories 9 % 10 % Family footwear 6 % 6 % Fine jewelry 5 % 5 % Services and other 5 % 5 % 100 % 100 % 22 Table of Contents Merchandise and Shopping Experience Initiatives Throughout 2007, we launched a number of private and exclusive brands designed to add newness and excitement to our merchandise offerings. The private brands included Ambrielle&reg;, a new lingerie brand. The exclusive brands included Liz & Co.&reg; , a traditional casual womens apparel and accessories line, and CONCEPTS by Claiborne, by Liz Claiborne, Inc. featuring casual sportswear, as well as suits and accessories for the modern male customer, C7P&reg;, a Chip & Pepper&reg; Production, a denim and sportswear line for juniors and young men and Messages from the Heart&reg;, an infant apparel and gift brand by author and artist Sandra Magsamen. We expanded Sephora inside JCPenney locations to 47 stores and opened 50 new and relocated stores in 2007, 42 of which were off mall. We also launched a Know Before You Go initiative on jcp.com, which provides customers with innovative features, such as enhanced search capabilities and product information, merchandise availability at local stores and the ability to view weekly sales circulars online, making shopping at JCPenney easier and more efficient. Gross Margin ($ in millions) 2007 2006 First in first out (FIFO) gross margin $ 7,664 $ 7,809 Last in first out (LIFO) credit 7 16 Gross margin $ 7,671 $ 7,825 As a percent of sales 38.6 % 39.3 % Through the first half of 2007, gross margin increased 70 basis points to 39.8% of sales, or $3,481 million on a dollar basis, compared to 39.1%, or $3,305 million, for the comparable 2006 period. Gross margin was pressured in the third and fourth quarters by an inventory plan that anticipated higher sales and thus resulted in more promotional selling and higher levels of clearance merchandise. As a result, 2007 full year gross margin declined 70 basis points, as a percent of sales, following a 100 basis point improvement in 2006. SG&A Expenses ($ in millions) 2007 2006 SG&A $ 5,402 $ 5,470 As a percent of sales 27.2 % 27.5 % For 2007, SG&A expenses were 27.2% of sales, an improvement of 30 basis points, compared to 27.5% of sales for 2006. On a dollar basis, SG&A expenses for 2007 were down 1.2% from 2006. Advertising expenses, as a percent of sales, were consistent with the prior year. While overall SG&A expenses were well controlled, the two primary contributors to the year over year improvement were lower salary and related expenses, as well as lower incentive compensation expense. During 2007 and 2006, advertising allowances offset gross advertising expense by $210 million and $163 million, respectively. Pension (Income)/Expense Pension income in 2007 was driven primarily from our qualified pension plan. Strong market returns in 2006, as well as cash contributions of $1.2 billion on a pre tax basis, or $300 million per year in 2006, 2004, 2003 and 2002, resulted in pension income of $45 million in 2007 compared to pension expense of $51 million in 2006. 23 Table of Contents Depreciation and Amortization As expected with the accelerated store growth and investments in improving and modernizing existing facilities, depreciation and amortization expenses increased to $426 million in 2007, compared to $389 million in 2006. As a percent of sales, depreciation and amortization expenses were consistent from year to year at approximately 2%. Pre Opening Expense With the launch of the Companys accelerated store growth strategy in 2006, pre opening expense increased to $46 million in 2007, compared to $27 million in 2006. The Company opened 50 and 28 new stores in 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Operating Income In 2007, operating income declined by 20 basis points as a percent of sales, driven by a negative trend in sales and gross margin rates. While we continued to make significant improvements in merchandise assortments, as well as further refinements to our planning and allocation systems to ensure that the merchandise is in the right place at the right time, the challenging retail environment in the second half of 2007 led to a softening in sales and a related increase in markdowns. Net Interest Expense The 2007 increase in net interest expense was primarily the result of an increase in average long term debt, combined with a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and a decrease in corresponding short term interest rates. The weighted average interest rate on long term debt declined to 7.5% in 2007, compared to 7.8% in 2006. Interest income earned on short term investment balances remained about the same in 2007 as the prior year at an average annual interest rate of 5.0%. Bond Premiums and Unamortized Costs We incurred premiums, commissions and unamortized costs of $12 million in 2007 related to the early redemption of JCPs 8.125% Debentures Due 2027. Income Taxes The overall effective tax rates for continuing operations were 35.9% for 2007 and 36.7% for 2006. The 2007 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the release of $38 million, or $0.17 per share, of income tax reserves resulting from the favorable resolution of prior year tax matters. The 2006 rate was favorably impacted by the release of $32 million, or $0.14 per share, of income tax reserves resulting from the favorable resolution of prior year tax matters. 24 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations added $0.03 per share to net income in 2007 resulting from our ongoing review and true up of reserves for discontinued operations. For 2006, discontinued operations added $0.08 per share to net income and were primarily related to positive variances on tax reserves that had been provided for in connection with the sale of previously owned businesses. 2009 Outlook Operating Performance For 2009, we anticipate weak consumer spending to continue. Consequently, we are planning for full year comparable stores sales to decline approximately 10% and for total sales to decrease high single digits. We expect a modest improvement in the gross margin rate for 2009 resulting from better alignment of our inventory at year end 2008 with current sales trends, combined with our plan to manage future inventory receipts to a low double digit decrease. Excluding pension expense, which is discussed below, we expect operating expenses for 2009 to be relatively flat with 2008. Pension Expense Total pension expense in 2009 is expected to be $363 million, as compared to a credit of $90 million in 2008. Pension expense for 2009 is comprised of $322 million non cash expense for the primary plan and $41 million expense for the supplemental pension plans. This compares with the 2008 pension credit of $133 million and $43 million expense, respectively. The increase in total pension expense in 2009 versus 2008 is due almost entirely to the swing in the primary plan. Pension expense in 2009 for the primary plan is negatively impacted by the amortization of unrecognized losses that resulted from the sharp decline in plan assets during 2008. At the measurement date of January 31, 2009, which was used to set the pension expense, the unrecognized loss balance was $2.3 billion. Under SFAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, any unrecognized losses outside the allowable corridor are amortized over the average remaining service period of the current work force seven years for our Company. The amortization component of the 2009 pension expense for the primary plan amounts to $277 million. The remaining $45 million of the $322 million of primary plan expense in 2009 represents the net of other components of pension expense service cost, interest and expected return on assets. The expected return on assets for 2009 was negatively impacted by the lowering of the expected rate of return assumption to 8.4% from 8.9%. Pension Funding Based on the funded status of our primary pension plan, we are not required to make mandatory pension plan contributions in 2009 or 2010 as determined under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) rules, as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. 25 Table of Contents Financial Condition and Liquidity Overview In 2008, despite the sharp deterioration in consumer spending, we continued to maintain our strong financial position, improved our cash flow metrics and retained the flexibility to continue the execution of our Bridge Plan initiatives. Our ability to sustain a strong financial position and financial flexibility further enhanced our competitive position and, going forward, will allow us to take advantage of future opportunities as the economic environment improves. The foundation of our strong liquidity position is our cash and cash equivalent balances and our ability to generate positive cash flow from operating activities of continuing operations in excess of capital expenditures and dividend payments, net of proceeds from the sale of assets (defined as free cash flow, a non GAAP financial measure discussed on page 28.) For 2008, we ended the year with approximately $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalent balances and had positive free cash flow of $21 million, an improvement of $163 million compared to 2007. Moreover, we expect this measure to further improve in 2009 as we moderate capital expenditures, control expenses and manage inventory in line with expected sales trends. In addition to cash flow and cash and cash equivalent balances, which are sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, our existing credit facility provides an additional $1.2 billion source of liquidity. Other than the issuance of trade and standby letters of credit, which totaled $152 million at year end 2008, we have not utilized this facility nor do we expect to do so. Our liquidity position is further enhanced by two additional factors: we have no debt maturing during 2009 and we are not required to make a mandatory cash contribution to our qualified pension plan. While the funded status of our primary pension plan weakened during 2008 as a result of the decline in the capital markets, the plan remains well funded relative to other large corporate pension plans. As a result of our funded status, we are not required to make mandatory pension plan contributions in 2009 or 2010 as determined under ERISA rules, as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. In August 2008, we paid a $200 million debt maturity from our cash and cash equivalent balances. Our next debt maturity is in March 2010 for approximately $500 million, which we plan to fund from our cash and cash equivalent balances. 26 Table of Contents The following table provides a summary of our key components and ratios of financial condition and liquidity: ($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,352 $ 2,532 $ 2,803 Merchandise inventory 3,259 3,641 3,400 Property and equipment, net 5,367 4,959 4,162 Long term debt, including current maturities 3,505 3,708 3,444 Stockholders equity 4,155 5,312 4,288 Total capital 7,660 9,020 7,732 Additional amounts available under the 2005 Credit Agreement 1,200 1,200 1,200 Cash flow from operating activities of continuing operations 1,155 1,249 (1) 1,258 (1) Free cash flow (non GAAP financial measure) (2) 21 (142 )(1) 353 (1) Capital expenditures 969 1,243 772 Dividends paid 178 174 153 Ratios: Debt to total capital(3) 45.8 % 41.1 % 44.5 % Cash to debt(4) 67.1 % 68.3 % 81.4 % (1) Includes $300 million discretionary cash contribution to our qualified pension plan in 2006.

Bridge Plan At our April 2008 financial analyst meeting, we discussed modifications to our financial and business plans, referred to as the Companys Bridge Plan. The Bridge Plan is designed to enable us to effectively navigate through the challenging retail environment, while working to maintain our financial strength and flexibility. The Bridge Plan outlines our initiatives between those items we expect to moderate, such as store growth and renovations, inventory levels and expenses; items we expect to maintain, such as our focus on the customer, our associates and our investors; and items we plan to accelerate, like Sephora inside JCPenney, CustomerFIRST initiatives and merchandise innovation. Since April, we have announced updates to our Bridge Plan in response to the continuing downturn of the economic environment in order to maintain our strong financial position. The updated Bridge Plan targets for 2009 include a reduction in capital expenditures to approximately $600 million, versus $969 million for 2008. This reflects plans to open 17 new stores, including one relocated store in 2009, compared to 35 new or relocated stores that we opened in 2008, including 31 in the off mall format. We expect to open 64 additional Sephora inside JCPenney locations during 2009, bringing our total to 155 locations. For 2010, we are planning capital expenditures at approximately $400 million to focus on improvements to existing stores and information technology infrastructure. In addition, we have reduced the store renovation plans for 2009 and 2010, as compared to the 24 renovations completed in 2008. We expect to fund capital expenditures for 2009 and 2010 with cash flow from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents. We continue to focus on aligning inventory levels with expected sales trends and carefully managing our operating expenses. Our Bridge Plan initiatives are designed to 27 Table of Contents put us back on the trajectory of our long range plan for growth and leadership in the retail industry when the economic environment improves. Cash and Cash Equivalents At year end 2008, we had approximately $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents, which represented approximately 67% of our $3.5 billion of outstanding long term debt. As of January 31, 2009, we had no current maturities. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $180 million in 2008, including a $200 million repayment of long term debt at maturity. Our cash investments are held in U.S. Treasury money market funds and a portfolio of highly rated bank deposits. In addition to cash and cash equivalents, our liquidity position includes a five year $1.2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that was put in place in April 2005 (2005 Credit Agreement). See further discussion on the credit agreement on page 33. Our liquidity is further enhanced by the fact that our current debt portfolio and material lease agreements contain no provisions that could trigger acceleration of payments or collateral support in the event of adverse changes in our financial condition. However, our 2007 debt issuances contain a change of control provision that would obligate us, at the holders option, to repurchase the debt at a price of 101% if there was a beneficial ownership change of 50% or more of our common stock and the debt was rated non investment grade. This provision applies to $1 billion of our debt. Free Cash Flow (Non GAAP Financial Measure) We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations less capital expenditures and dividends paid, plus proceeds from sale of assets. Free cash flow is considered a non GAAP financial measure under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. We believe that free cash flow is a relevant indicator of our ability to repay maturing debt, revise our dividend policy or fund other uses of capital that we believe will enhance stockholder value. Free cash flow is limited and does not represent remaining cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt maturities and other obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, our entire statement of cash flows and those measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to free cash flow, a non GAAP financial measure. ($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations (GAAP measure) $ 1,155 $ 1,249 (1) $ 1,258 (1) Less: Capital expenditures (969 ) (1,243 ) (772 ) Dividends paid, common (178 ) (174 ) (153 ) Plus: Proceeds from sale of assets 13 26 20 Free cash flow (a non GAAP financial measure) $ 21 $ (142 ) $ 353 (1) Includes a $300 million discretionary cash contribution to our qualified pension plan in 2006. The approximately $110 million tax benefit related to the 2006 contribution was realized in 2007. No such contributions were made in 2008 or 2007. Notwithstanding the difficult operating conditions in 2008, we generated $21 million of positive free cash flow, an improvement of $163 million over 2007. 28 Table of Contents Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of both continuing and discontinued operations: ($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Net cash provided by/(used in): Continuing operations: Operating activities $ 1,155 $ 1,249 (1) $ 1,258 (1) Investing activities (956 ) (1,217 ) (752 ) Financing activities (380 ) (286 ) (751 ) Discontinued operations: Operating activities 2 8 11 Investing activities (1 ) (25 ) (32 ) Financing activities Net (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (180 ) $ (271 ) $ (266 ) (1) Includes a $300 million discretionary cash contribution to our qualified pension plan in 2006. The approximately $110 million tax benefit related to the 2006 contribution was realized in 2007. No such contributions were made in 2008 or 2007. Cash Flow from Operating Activities Continuing Operations Our operations are seasonal in nature, with the business depending to a great extent on the last quarter of the year when a significant portion of the sales, profits and positive operating cash flows are realized. Cash requirements are highest in the third quarter as we build inventory levels in preparation for the holiday season. During 2008, our peak cash requirements declined more than 15% as we reduced inventory receipts. We expect peak cash requirements to further decline in 2009 as we continue to plan double digit sales declines and lower inventory receipts. 2008 cash flow from operating activities of continuing operations decreased compared to 2007 as the result of a decline in income from continuing operations impacted by the weakened consumer spending environment largely offset by effective inventory management. Based on our goal of maintaining a strong liquidity position, we elected to forego making a voluntary pension plan contribution in 2008. Total inventory was $3,259 million at the end of 2008, down 10.5% from last year, primarily as a result of our effective inventory management in response to the challenging business environment, even with the addition of 35 new stores (26 net of relocations and closings.) On a comparable store basis, inventories were down approximately 13.5% from last year, including inventory for the major launch of American Living and the continued expansion of Sephora inside JCPenney. In response to the soft selling environment, we managed merchandise inventory down to desirable levels by reducing receipts and taking effective clearance actions. We believe that the inventory level at the end of 2008 is appropriately balanced and reflects our expected near term sales trends, which are planned down 10% for comparable stores. Inventory turns for 2008, 2007 and 2006 were 3.06, 3.14 and 3.33, respectively. Cash Flow from Investing Activities Continuing Operations In 2008 we had capital expenditures, including capitalized software costs of $969 million, which we used towards opening 35 new or relocated stores, 31 in our off mall format. We also completed significant fixturing and store environment improvements in about 600 stores, as well as 24 major renovations and 90 store refurbishments. Capital expenditures, including capitalized software costs, 29 Table of Contents were $1,243 million in 2007 and $772 million in 2006. The following provides a breakdown of capital expenditures: ($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 New and relocated stores $ 460 $ 687 $ 365 Store renewals and updates 322 389 266 Technology and other 187 167 141 Total $ 969 $ 1,243 $ 772 We expect 2009 capital expenditures to be approximately $600 million principally relating to store renewals and updates, new stores and relocations, merchandise initiatives, technology and other support projects. We currently plan to open 17 new and relocated stores in 2009, of which 16 are expected to be off mall and one in the Manhattan Mall in New York City. We also expect to modernize approximately 20 existing stores. Incorporating relocations and store closures, net square footage is expected to increase approximately 1.7% in 2009 compared to a 3.0% increase in 2008. Our 2009 capital expenditures are expected to be funded with cash flow from operations and existing cash and cash equivalent balances. Cash Flow from Financing Activities Continuing Operations There were no issuances of new debt during 2008. Cash payments on long term debt, including capital leases, totaled $203 million and consisted primarily of the August 2008 payment at maturity of $200 million outstanding principal amount of JCPs 7.375% Notes Due 2008. During 2007, we received $980 million in proceeds from the issuance of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount in new senior notes, which was used in 2007 and 2008 for debt payments and general corporate purposes. Cash payments for long term debt, including capital leases and early retirement premiums in 2007, totaled $746 million. In 2006, there were no issuances of long term debt, and cash payments for long term debt, including capital leases, totaled $21 million. During 2008, we returned $178 million to stockholders through dividend payments. During 2007, we returned to stockholders $400 million through common stock repurchases and $174 million through dividend payments. In 2006, we returned to stockholders $750 million through common stock repurchases and $153 million through dividend payments. We maintained our quarterly dividend on common stock at $0.20 per share in 2008. The dividend rate was raised to $0.20 per share beginning with the May 1, 2007 dividend payment. Quarterly dividends of $0.18 per share were paid in 2006. The Board reviews the dividend policy and rate on a quarterly basis, taking into consideration the overall financial and strategic outlook for the Company, earnings, liquidity and cash flow projections, as well as competitive factors. The Board approves and declares dividends on a quarterly basis. Net proceeds from the exercise of stock options declined significantly in 2008 to $4 million, compared to $45 million in 2007 and $135 million in 2006. The decline was the result of fewer stock options being exercised due to the Companys stock price being lower than the exercise price of the majority of our exercisable stock options. Excess tax benefits realized from stock based compensation were $1 million, $17 million and $39 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 30 Table of Contents Cash Flow and Financing Outlook In 2009, our financing strategy will continue to focus on opportunities to maintain and even further strengthen our financial position, improve our credit profile and deliver value to stockholders. Our strong financial position provides continued financial flexibility to support our Bridge Plan. In March 2009, the Board declared a quarterly dividend to be paid on May 1, 2009 of $0.20 per share, unchanged from the prior quarterly dividend declaration. For 2009, the operating and capital expenditure plans have been adjusted to reflect current operating conditions, while continuing to reinvest capital to drive the initiatives of our Bridge Plan. While we expect operating cash flow to decrease principally as a result of lower net income expectations, by moderating our capital expenditures we anticipate our free cash flow (a non GAAP financial measure) to be positive for 2009. Until all of our credit ratings improve to competitive investment grade levels, access to the capital markets for cash needs will retain an element of uncertainty. As such, we intend to maintain sufficient cash investment levels to ensure support for operational business needs, strategic initiatives and long term debt maturities. We do not expect to borrow under our credit facility except to support ongoing letters of credit and we have no debt maturities in 2009. In accordance with our long term financing strategy, we manage our financial position on a multi year basis and may access the capital markets opportunistically. 31 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Commitments Aggregated information about our obligations and commitments to make future contractual payments, such as debt and lease agreements, and contingent commitments as of January 31, 2009 is presented in the following table.

Penney Purchasing Corporation are parties to a five year $1.2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (2005 Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of lenders with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. The 2005 Credit Agreement is available for general corporate purposes, including the issuance of letters of credit. Pricing is tiered based on JCPs senior unsecured long term debt ratings by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poors Ratings Services. JCPs obligations under the 2005 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company. No borrowings, other than the issuance of trade and standby letters of credit, which totaled $152 million as of the end of 2008, have been made under this facility. The 2005 Credit Agreement includes two financial leverage metric covenants, which we are required to satisfy, a leverage ratio covenant and a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant. The leverage ratio for 2008 was 2.2 to 1.0, remaining in compliance with the 2005 Credit Agreement covenant requirement of no more than 3.0 to 1.0. The fixed charge coverage ratio for 2008 was 3.9 to 1.0, also remaining in compliance with the 2005 Credit Agreement covenant requirement of at least 3.2 to 1.0. See further discussion in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. In light of the current business and credit environment, we intend to amend and extend our credit agreement in 2009. The renewed facility would have similar covenants as our current facility but would be adjusted to remove the non cash pension expense and to set the covenant thresholds in alignment with our 2009 operating plan expectations. Due to our lower expected working capital requirements, the new facility would be a smaller size than the current bank line. The facility would also likely require a pledge of inventory as collateral due to overall tight lending standards. With our strong liquidity position, there is no critical need for a credit facility, since we do not expect to borrow under such a facility other than for the issuance of letters of credit. Nonetheless, we understand that a line of credit would provide further strength to our solid liquidity position during the Bridge Plan period. Credit Ratings Our credit ratings and outlook as of March 26, 2009 were as follows: Long TermDebt Outlook Moodys Investors Service, Inc. Baa3 On Review Standard & Poors Ratings Services BBB Negative Fitch Ratings BBB Stable Rating agencies consider the following factors in their rating decisions: changes in operating performance, comparable store sales, the economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, financial leverage and changes in our business strategy. In February 2009, Standard and Poors Rating Services and Moodys Investors Service, Inc. have both placed the Company on review for possible downgrade citing the unlikelihood that we could avoid sustained declines in comparable store sales. During 2008, we maintained our investment grade credit rating. In February 2009, Fitch Ratings downgraded our long term debt rating to BBB from BBB, citing expectations for continued weakness in comparable store sales through 2009. Fitch Ratings reaffirmed our stable rating outlook. In November 2008, Standard and Poors Ratings Services affirmed our long term debt rating at BBB and 33 Table of Contents revised its outlook for the Company from stable to negative. The outlook revision reflected the challenging operating environment, which resulted in the acceleration of comparable store sales declines. In February 2008, Moodys Investors Service, Inc. affirmed the Companys long term credit rating at Baa3 and revised its rating outlook to stable from positive, citing recent negative comparable store sales and uncertain overall economic outlook. Despite the economic conditions that have impacted our operating performance, we continue to focus on restoring our competitive investment grade credit ratings. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Management considers all on and off balance sheet debt in evaluating our overall liquidity position and capital structure. Other than operating leases, which are included in the Contractual Obligations and Commitments table on page 32, we do not have any off balance sheet financing. See detailed disclosure regarding operating leases and their off balance sheet present value in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. As part of the 2001 sale of the assets of our Direct Marketing Services subsidiary, JCP signed a guarantee agreement with a maximum exposure of $20 million. Any potential claims or losses are first recovered from established reserves, then from the purchaser and finally from any state insurance guarantee fund before JCPs guarantee would be invoked. As a result, we do not believe that any potential exposure would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We do not have any additional arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements. Common Stock During 2006 to 2008, the number of outstanding shares of common stock changed as follows, primarily as a result of common stock repurchases: (shares in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Balance at beginning of the year 222 226 233 Repurchase and retirement of common stock (5 ) (11 ) Exercise of stock options 1 4 Balance at end of year 222 222 226 Common Stock Repurchases As authorized by the Board in March 2007, we repurchased 5.1 million shares of common stock for $400 million during the second quarter of 2007 and as authorized by the Board in February 2006, we repurchased 11.3 million shares of common stock for $750 million during 2006. The 2007 and 2006 stock repurchase programs were funded with cash proceeds from employee stock option exercises and existing cash and cash equivalent balances. Common stock was retired on the same day it was repurchased. There are no outstanding Board authorizations to repurchase common stock. 34 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that we make estimates and use assumptions that in some instances may materially affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments based on history and current trends, as well as other factors that we believe are relevant at the time of the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Historically, actual results have not differed materially from estimates; however, future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty and as a result, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates. We have discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to these policies in this MD&A. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of all of our significant accounting policies. Inventory Valuation under the Retail Method Inventories are valued primarily at the lower of cost (using the last in, first out or LIFO method) or market, determined by the retail method for department stores, store distribution centers and regional warehouses and standard cost, representing average vendor cost, for Direct (catalog and Internet). Under the retail method, retail values are converted to a cost basis by applying specific average cost factors to groupings of merchandise. The retail method inherently requires management judgment and certain estimates that may significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost, as well as gross margin. Two of the most significant estimates are permanent reductions to retail prices (markdowns) used to clear unproductive or slow moving inventory and inventory shortages (shrinkage). Permanent markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded at the point of decision, when the utility of inventory has diminished, versus the point of sale. Factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand, customer preferences, age of the merchandise and style trends. The corresponding reduction to gross margin is recorded in the period the decision is made. Shrinkage is estimated as a percent of sales for the period from the last inventory date to the end of the fiscal period. Physical inventories are taken at least annually and inventory records are adjusted accordingly. The shrinkage rate from the most recent physical inventory, in combination with current events and historical experience, is used as the standard for the shrinkage accrual rate for the next inventory cycle. We do not believe that the assumptions used in these estimates will change significantly based on prior experience. A 10% increase or decrease in the markdown reserve at year end 2008 would have impacted net income by approximately $5 million. A 10% increase or decrease in the estimated inventory shrinkage reserve at year end 2008 would have impacted net income by approximately $6 million. Valuation of Long Lived Assets We evaluate recoverability of long lived assets, such as property and equipment, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, such as historical operating losses or plans to close stores and dispose of or sell long lived assets before the end of their 35 Table of Contents previously estimated useful lives. Additionally, for store assets, in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year we separately test the performance of individual stores and underperforming stores are selected for further evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying amounts. If the evaluation, performed on an undiscounted cash flow basis, indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, the potential impairment is measured as the excess of carrying value over the fair value of the impaired asset. The impairment calculation requires us to apply estimates for future cash flows and use judgments for qualitative factors such as local market conditions, operating environment, mall performance and other trends. For stores, we estimate fair value based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate that is considered commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model and for assets other than stores, we generally base fair value on either appraised value or projected discounted cash flows. We recognize an impairment loss in the period in which it occurs. The carrying value is adjusted to the new carrying value and any subsequent increases in fair value are not recorded. If it is determined that the estimated remaining useful life of the asset should be decreased, the periodic depreciation expense is adjusted based on the new carrying value of the asset. Impairment losses totaling $21 million, $1 million and $2 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, were recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in the real estate and other, net line item. The 2008 impairment charges include primarily a department store, a real estate joint venture property and other corporate assets. While we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate long lived asset impairments, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may be exposed to additional impairment charges, which could be material to our results of operations. Reserves and Valuation Allowances Based on an overall analysis of store performance and expected trends, we periodically evaluate the need to close underperforming stores. Reserves are established at the point of closure for the present value of any remaining operating lease obligations (PVOL), net of estimated sublease income, and at the point of decision for severance and other exit costs, as prescribed by SFAS 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. See further discussion in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements on page F 14. Two key assumptions in calculating the reserve include the timeframe expected to terminate lease agreements and estimation of other related exit costs. If different assumptions were used regarding the timing and potential termination costs, the resulting reserves could vary from recorded amounts. Reserves are reviewed periodically and adjusted, when necessary. We record a provision for workers compensation and general liability risk based on historical experience, current claims data and independent actuarial best estimates, including incurred but not reported claims and projected loss development factors. We target this provision above the midpoint of the actuarial range, and total estimated claim liability amounts are discounted using a risk free rate. We do not anticipate any significant change in loss trends, settlements or other costs that would cause a significant fluctuation in net income. However, a 10% variance in the workers compensation and general liability reserves at year end 2008 would have affected net income by approximately $14 million. Income taxes are estimated for each jurisdiction in which we operate. This involves assessing the current tax exposure together with temporary differences, which result from differing treatment of items for tax and book purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are provided for based on these 36 Table of Contents assessments. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for recoverability based on estimated future taxable income. To the extent that recovery is deemed unlikely, a valuation allowance is recorded. Effective February 4, 2007, tax contingency accruals are measured and recorded in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASBs) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, (FIN 48), which is discussed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. Previously, such accruals were provided when the Company considered that it was probable that taxes would be due. Tax contingency accruals are evaluated and adjusted as appropriate, while taking into account the progress of audits of various taxing jurisdictions. We do not expect the outcome of tax audits to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. Many years of data have been incorporated into the determination of tax reserves, and our estimates have historically been reasonable. As of January 31, 2009, we estimated our total potential environmental liabilities to range from $34 million to $46 million and recorded our best estimate of $39 million in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of that date. This estimate covered potential liabilities primarily related to underground storage tanks, remediation of environmental conditions involving our former Eckerd drugstore locations, and asbestos removal in connection with approved plans to renovate or dispose of Company facilities. Even if we were to incur losses at the upper end of the estimated range, we do not believe that such losses would have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. In establishing our reserves for liabilities associated with underground storage tanks, we maintain and periodically update an inventory listing of potentially impacted sites. The estimated cost of remediation efforts is based on our historical experience, as well as industry and other published data. With respect to our former Eckerd operations, we accessed extensive databases of environmental matters, including data from the Environmental Protection Agency, to estimate the cost of remediation. Our experience, as well as relevant data, was used to develop a range of potential liabilities, and a reserve was established at the time of the Eckerd sale. The Eckerd reserve is adjusted as payments are made or new information becomes known. Reserves for asbestos removal are based on our known liabilities in connection with approved plans for store modernization, renovations, or dispositions of store locations. We believe the established reserves, as adjusted, are adequate to cover estimated potential liabilities. Pension Pension Accounting We maintain a qualified funded defined benefit pension plan (primary plan) and smaller non qualified unfunded supplemental defined benefit plans. The accounting for these plans is covered under SFAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans. The determination of pension expense is the result of actuarial calculations that are based on important assumptions about pension assets and liabilities. The most important of these are the rate of return on assets and the discount rate assumptions. These assumptions require significant judgment and a change in any one of them could have a significant effect on our pension expense reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, as well as in the liability and equity sections of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Pension expense is reported separately on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the reclassification of pension (income)/expense on page F 8. 37 Table of Contents The following table reflects our rate of return and discount rate assumptions: 2008 2007 2006 Expected return on plan assets 8.9 % 8.9 % 8.9 % Discount rate for pension expense 6.54 %(1) 5.85 % 5.80 % Discount rate for pension obligation 6.95 % 6.46 % 5.85 % (1) Reflects a rate change from the prior year discount rate for pension obligation due to the measurement date provision of SFAS 158. Return on Plan Assets and Impact on Earnings For the primary plan, we apply our expected return on plan assets using fair market value as of the annual measurement date. The fair market value method results in greater volatility to our pension expense than the more commonly used calculated value method (referred to as smoothing of assets), which is also permitted under SFAS 87. Our primary pension plan is well diversified with an asset allocation policy that provides for a targeted 70%, 20% and 10% mix of equities (U.S., non U.S. and private), fixed income (investment grade and high yield) and real estate (private and public), respectively. This allocation provides the pension plan with the appropriate balance of investment return and volatility risk, given the funded nature of the plan, our present and future liability characteristics and our long term investment horizon. As a result of recent negative returns in the capital markets and lower expected future returns, we reduced the expected rate of return assumption to 8.4% from 8.9% beginning in 2009, which equals the historical rate of return since the plans inception in 1966. The actual rate of return of (30)%, measured on January 31, 2009, versus the expected return on assets resulted in a negative funded status of the primary pension plan of $275 million, and in a large increase in unrecognized losses that reduced equity through other comprehensive income. The significant balance in unrecognized losses will result in a material swing in pension expense in 2009 versus the pension credit recorded in 2008. Discount Rate The discount rate assumption used to determine our postretirement obligations was based on an externally published yield curve, which is determined by the plans actuary. The yield curve is a hypothetical AA yield curve represented by a series of bonds maturing from 6 months to 30 years, designed to match the corresponding pension benefit cash payments to retirees. Each underlying bond issue is required to have a rating of Aa2 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or a rating of AA or better by Standard & Poors Ratings Services. We believe the yield curve provides a better match to the timing and amount of expected benefit payments. The discount rate increased to 6.95% from 6.54% as of January 31, 2009 and will have a small positive impact on 2009 expected pension expense. Sensitivity The sensitivity of the pension expense to a plus or minus one half of one percent of expected return on assets is a decrease or increase in expense of approximately $0.05 per share. An increase or decrease in the discount rate of one half of one percent would decrease or increase the expense by approximately $0.10 per share. 38 Table of Contents Pension Funding Funding requirements for our primary pension plan are determined under ERISA rules, as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. As a result of the strong funded status of the pension plan, we are not required to make contributions in 2009 or 2010. However, we may make discretionary voluntary contributions taking into account liquidity and capital resource availability and capital market conditions. Our funding policy is to maintain a well funded pension plan throughout all business and economic cycles. Maintaining a well funded plan over time provides additional financial flexibility, which includes lower pension expense and reduced cash contributions, especially in the event of a decline in the capital markets. In addition, a well funded plan assures associates of the plans and our financial ability to continue to provide competitive retirement benefits, while at the same time being cost effective. Consistent with our objectives, we contributed $1.2 billion on a pre tax basis, or $300 million per year in 2006, 2004, 2003 and 2002. These contributions have helped to mitigate the negative returns from the downward cycle experienced in 2008 and have allowed the plan to continue to meet regulatory funding requirements.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information This Annual Report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements made within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which reflect our current view of future events and financial performance. The words expect, plan, anticipate, believe, intend, should, will and similar expressions identify forward looking statements. Any such forward looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to be materially different from planned or expected results. Those risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions, including inflation, recession, unemployment levels, consumer spending patterns, credit availability and debt levels, changes in store traffic trends, the cost of goods, trade restrictions, changes in tariff, freight, paper and postal rates, changes in cost of fuel and other energy and transportation costs, increases in wage and benefit costs, competition and retail industry consolidations, interest rate fluctuations, dollar and other currency valuations, risks associated with war, an act of terrorism or pandemic, and a systems failure and or security breach that results in the theft, transfer or unauthorized disclosure of customer, employee or Company information. Furthermore, our Company typically earns a disproportionate share of its operating income in the fourth quarter due to holiday buying patterns, and such buying patterns are difficult to forecast with certainty. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is impossible to predict the degree to which any such factors could cause actual results to differ materially from predicted results. For additional discussion on risks and uncertainties, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, beginning on page 4. We intend the forward looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K to speak only as of the date of this report and do not undertake to update or revise these projections as more information becomes available. 39 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We maintain a majority of our cash and cash equivalents in financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less. Such investments are subject to interest rate risk and may have a small decline in value if interest rates increase. Since the financial instruments are of short duration, a change of 100 basis points in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial condition. All of our outstanding long term debt as of January 31, 2009 is at fixed interest rates and would not be affected by interest rate changes. Future borrowings under our multi year revolving credit facility, to the extent that fluctuating rate loans were used, would be affected by interest rate changes. As of January 31, 2009, no borrowings were outstanding under the facility other than the issuance of trade and standby letters of credit, which totaled $152 million. We do not believe that a change of 100 basis points in interest rates would have a material effect on our financial condition. The fair value of long term debt is estimated by obtaining quotes from brokers or is based on current rates offered for similar debt. At January 31, 2009 long term debt, excluding capital leases and other, had a carrying value of $3.5 billion and a fair value of $2.6 billion. At February 2, 2008, long term debt, excluding capital leases and other, had a carrying value of $3.7 billion and a fair value of $3.6 billion. The effects of changes in the U.S. equity and bond markets serve to increase or decrease the value of assets in our qualified pension plan. Significant declines in pension assets during 2008 due to the sharp declines in the capital markets resulted in a negative funded status of $275 million in the primary pension plan. At the January 31, 2009 measurement date, plan assets of $3.4 billion were approximately 93% of the $3.7 billion pension liability. Under ERISA rules, as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, the funded status of the plan exceeded 100% as of December 31, 2008, the qualified pension plans year end. We seek to manage exposure to adverse equity and bond returns by maintaining diversified investment portfolios and utilizing professional investment managers.
