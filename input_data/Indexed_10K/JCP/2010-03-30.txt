Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion, which presents our results, should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, along with the unaudited Five Year Financial and Operations Summaries, the risk factors and the cautionary statement regarding forward looking information. Unless otherwise indicated, this Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) relates only to results from continuing operations, all references to earnings per share (EPS) are on a diluted basis and all references to years relate to fiscal years rather than to calendar years. Financial Reporting We remain committed to continuously improving the transparency of our financial reporting by providing stockholders with informative financial disclosures and presenting a clear and balanced view of our financial position and operating results. We continue to employ a reporting matrix that requires written certifications on a quarterly basis from a cross disciplined team of approximately 20 senior members of our management team who have responsibility for preparing, verifying and reporting corporate results. For this Annual Report on Form 10 K, we enhanced our financial reporting as follows: We provided additional non GAAP financial measures excluding the non cash impact of our primary pension plan to enable investors to more clearly assess our results of operations and allow for better comparability with other retailers. These non GAAP financial measures, including their limitations, are defined and discussed in Item 6, Selected Financial Data, and they are used throughout this MD&A. We added a table in the sales discussion of MD&A to provide the components of the change in sales from the prior year. We expanded the information in Item 2, Properties, in Part I regarding the locations and square footage of our merchandise distribution centers, regional warehouses and Direct fulfillment centers. We changed our method of accounting for inventory from last in, first out (LIFO) to first in, first out (FIFO) to better reflect the results our operations. This change resulted in a $2 million credit to gross margin in 2009 and is discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. We provided disclosures about the fair value of investments comprising our primary pension plan assets, as well as non financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, as required by new fair value disclosure rules. We replaced technical accounting references with plain English descriptions of the basic rules to enhance the readability of the report. Consistent with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting each fiscal year. In relation to these requirements, our external auditors expressed an unqualified opinion regarding the effective operation of our internal control over financial reporting. Executive Overview Beginning in late 2007, the economy entered a period of weak economic growth. This continued into 2008 and the financial market crisis precipitated a series of events that generated conditions more 15 Table of Contents severe than any experienced in many decades. The characteristics of the financial crisis were unique, in part due to the complex structure of mortgage backed and related securities that were at the epicenter of the financial market turmoil. A steep housing correction, along with downward valuations of mortgage backed and related securities, combined to foster a crisis in confidence. Although several other factors contributed to the economic and financial conditions, the influence of these financial developments, particularly with respect to housing and consumer credit, directly impacted our customer. While the economic outlook is improving, it is rebounding from a very low base with a range of possible outcomes due to the uncertain financial market environment and dependence upon ongoing policy responses. The retail sector appears to be improving, although recovery remains fragile due to continuing tightness in the credit markets and weak labor markets. Although the housing market is stabilizing, challenges remain due to rising foreclosure rates and excess housing inventories. Going into the year, we factored the economic environment into our plan for 2009. We planned our business for a tough economic environment, and saw 2009 as an opportunity to strengthen our business by improving our fashion offerings and significantly improving many aspects of our operations in order to put in place a strong foundation for the future. Our discipline in controlling costs and managing inventory produced better than expected results for JCPenney. 2009 Highlights EPS from continuing operations was $1.07 and was up significantly from our plan of $0.20. Gross margin as a percentage of sales, at 39.4%, exceeded the previous peak reached in 2006 and was 200 basis points better than last year. Free cash flow improved by $785 million during the year, and we ended the year with $3 billion of cash and cash equivalents. SG&A expenses were 0.2% lower than last year, despite having a larger store base. We further improved the funded status of our primary pension plan by voluntarily contributing approximately 13.4 million shares of JCPenney common stock valued at $340 million. We opened 17 new stores, including our first ever store in Manhattan. In addition, we opened 64 Sephora inside JCPenney locations to bring our total to 155 locations. We launched several new brands, such as ALLEN B.&reg; by Allen Schwartz and I Heart Ronson and further strengthened and improved assortments of some of our private and exclusive brands, including a.n.a&reg;, Worthington&reg; and St. Johns Bay&reg;, as well as American Living&reg;, which experienced better sales and gross margin. We entered into an agreement with Liz Claiborne, Inc. to make JCPenney the exclusive department store retailer for Liz Claiborne branded merchandise, other than footwear and beauty products, starting in fall 2010. We announced the launch of OlsenboyeTM, an exclusive new juniors brand created by Dualstar Entertainment Group founders and designers Mary Kate Olsen and Ashley Olsen. We announced our plan to launch MNG by Mango&reg;, a fast fashion brand that will bring European runway design at affordable prices to our stores. We will launch in the fall of 2010 in jcp.com and in approximately 80 stores, with plans to expand to a total of 600 stores by the end of 2011. We were ranked number one in customer service among department stores in the annual independent American Express/National Retail Federation (NRF) Foundation 2009 Customer Service Survey. 16 Table of Contents Current Developments On March 1, 2010, we repaid at maturity the remaining $393 million outstanding principal amount of JCPs 8.0% Notes due 2010. Also in March, our Board of Directors (Board) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share to be paid to stockholders on May 3, 2010. The dividend rate remains unchanged from our previous quarterly dividend payment. We launched our spring marketing campaign in March 2010. The campaign, entitled, New look. New day. Who knew.TM, focuses on helping customers discover the higher level of fashion in our merchandise assortments. We kicked off the campaign with commercials at the 2010 Academy Awards. Cindy Crawfords newest collaboration with us, One KissTM by Cindy Crawford&reg;, is being introduced in April 2010. This new brand reflects how we are answering the growing demand for fashionable fine jewelry that can be worn every day. 17 Table of Contents Results of Operations Three Year Comparison of Operating Performance (in millions, except EPS) 2009 2008 2007 Total net sales $ 17,556 $ 18,486 $ 19,860 Percent (decrease) from prior year (5.0 )% (6.9 )% (0.2 )%(1) Comparable store sales (decrease)/increase(2) (6.3 )% (8.5 )% 0.0 % Gross margin 6,910 6,915 7,671 Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) 5,382 5,395 5,402 Pension expense/(income) 337 (90 ) (45 ) Depreciation and amortization 495 469 426 Pre opening 28 31 46 Real estate and other, net 5 (25 ) (46 ) Total operating expenses 6,247 5,780 5,783 Operating income 663 1,135 1,888 As a percent of sales 3.8 % 6.1 % 9.5 % Adjusted operating income (non GAAP)(3) 961 1,002 1,791 As a percent of sales 5.5 % 5.4 % 9.0 % Net interest expense 260 225 153 Bond premiums and unamortized costs 12 Income from continuing operations before income taxes 403 910 1,723 Income tax expense 154 343 618 Income from continuing operations $ 249 $ 567 $ 1,105 Adjusted income from continuing operations (non GAAP)(3) $ 433 $ 484 $ 1,043 Diluted EPS from continuing operations $ 1.07 $ 2.54 $ 4.90 Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations (non GAAP)(3) $ 1.86 $ 2.17 $ 4.63 Average shares used for diluted EPS 233 223 225 (1) Includes the effect of the 53rd week in 2006. Excluding sales of $254 million for the 53rd week in 2006, total net sales increased 1.1% for 2007. (2) Comparable store sales are presented on a 52 week basis and include sales from new and relocated stores that have been opened for 12 consecutive full fiscal months and online sales through jcp.com. Stores closed for an extended period are not included in comparable store sales calculations, while stores remodeled and minor expansions not requiring store closures remain in the calculations. (3) See Item 6, Selected Financial Data, for a discussion of this non GAAP financial measure and reconciliation to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Income from continuing operations was $249 million, or $1.07 per share, in 2009 compared to $567 million, or $2.54 per share, in 2008 and $1,105 million, or $4.90 per share, in 2007. The year over year decline in results reflects the economic downturn as well as the significant increase in non cash primary pension plan expense. Excluding the non cash impact of our primary pension plan, adjusted income from continuing operations (non GAAP) was $433 million, or $1.86 per share, in 2009 compared with $484 million, or $2.17 per share, in 2008 and $1,043 million, or $4.63 per share, in 2007. Earnings for 2009 were better than our initial expectations and benefited significantly from our gross margin improvement that reflected the success of our strategy to sell a greater portion of 18 Table of Contents merchandise at regular promotional prices and less at clearance prices. Average shares used for the computation of diluted EPS increased from last year as a result of our contribution of approximately 13.4 million newly issued shares of common stock to the primary pension plan. Results for 2008 were impacted by pressure on gross margins in a highly promotional selling environment, particularly during the holiday season. Gross margin declined both in dollars and as a percentage of sales from the pressure of declining sales levels that resulted from the slowdown in consumer spending. The impact on operating income from lower gross margin was somewhat mitigated by effective control over operating expenses, despite incremental expenses related to new store openings. In 2007, results were impacted by gross margin pressure from the onset of the economic downturn that began in the second half of the year. The 2007 results benefited from tax credits of $38 million, or $0.17 per share, due to the release of income tax reserves resulting from the favorable resolution of prior year tax matters. 2009 Compared to 2008 Total Net Sales Our year to year change in total net sales is comprised of sales of stores opened in both years as well as online sales from jcp.com, referred to as comparable store sales, and sales from new stores net of closings and relocations, including catalog print media and outlet store sales, referred to as non comparable store sales. We consider comparable store sales to be a key indicator of our current performance measuring the growth in sales and sales productivity of existing stores. Positive comparable store sales contribute to greater leveraging of operating costs, particularly payroll and occupancy costs, while negative comparable store sales contribute to de leveraging of costs. Comparable store sales also have a direct impact on our total net sales and the level of cash flow. ($ in millions) 2009 2008 Total net sales $ 17,556 $ 18,486 Sales percent (decrease) Total net sales (5.0 )% (6.9 )% Comparable store sales (6.3 )% (8.5 )% Sales per gross square foot(1) $ 149 $ 160 (1) Calculation includes the sales of stores that were open for the full fiscal year, as well as online sales through jcp.com. Total net sales declined $930 million in 2009 compared to 2008. The following table provides the components of the net sales decline: ($ in millions) 2009 Comparable store sales decline $ (1,085 ) Sales of new stores 342 Sales of closed stores (34 ) Sales decline through catalog print media and outlet stores (153 ) 2009 total net sales decline $ (930 ) In 2009, comparable store sales decreased 6.3% as a result of continued weak consumer spending combined with our strategy to reduce clearance selling and unprofitable discounting by choosing not to anniversary promotions that negatively impacted operating profit. Sales of non comparable stores 19 Table of Contents opened in 2009 and 2008, net of closings, added $308 million. In 2009, we opened 15 net new stores (17 stores, net of 2 closings and relocations) and in 2008 we opened 26 net new stores (35 stores, net of 9 closings and relocations). As expected, catalog print media and outlet store sales declined in the year and reflected the continued shift in sales from print media to jcp.com. We anticipate this trend will continue in 2010 as we move forward with our previously announced strategy to eliminate our big book catalogs. All components combined, total net sales declined 5.0% in 2009, with approximately half of the decrease attributable to lower sales of clearance merchandise. JCPenney mall traffic was down approximately 4% for the year but exceeded overall mall traffic trends by 40 basis points. JCPenney off mall traffic was also down compared to last year but had stronger traffic trends than our mall stores. While our average unit retail increased slightly as a result of more merchandise sold at regular promotional prices, the number of transactions and the number of units sold declined as inventory levels were tightly managed in the difficult economic climate. Geographically, the southwest and central regions were the best performing regions for the year, while the southeast and northwest regions were the weakest performing. Sales for jcp.com increased 3.4% in the fourth quarter and ended the year with approximately $1.5 billion of sales, essentially flat with 2008. While sales in all merchandise categories declined versus last year, our best performing categories were shoes, in particular athletic footwear, and womens apparel. Fine jewelry and home experienced the weakest performance for the year. Private and exclusive brands found only at JCPenney continue to grow and as a percent of total merchandise sales were 54% in 2009 and 52% in 2008. Total Net Sales Mix The following percentages represent the mix of total net sales: 2009 2008 Womens apparel 24 % 24 % Home 19 % 20 % Mens apparel and accessories 19 % 19 % Childrens apparel 11 % 11 % Womens accessories, including Sephora 11 % 10 % Family footwear 7 % 6 % Fine jewelry 4 % 5 % Services and other 5 % 5 % 100 % 100 % During the year, we opened 64 Sephora inside JCPenney locations, bringing us to our 2009 goal of 155 locations compared to 91 at the end of 2008. Sephora continues to perform above plan, attracting younger, more affluent customers to our stores. We plan to open an additional 75 Sephora inside JCPenney locations in 2010. Merchandise Initiatives During 2009, we continued to enhance the customer shopping experience both in our stores and on jcp.com by offering our customers compelling new merchandise with a combination of style, quality and smart prices. In the spring, we introduced exciting and exclusive designer brands for women, ALLEN B. by Allen Schwartz and I Heart Ronson by Charlotte Ronson. 20 Table of Contents In July, in time for the Back to School shopping season, we launched three new surf and skate inspired brands for young men: RS By Sheckler, Rusty&reg; surf apparel and Third Rail, a Zoo York Production, catering to the action sports lifestyle. In September 2009, we launched Cindy Crawford Style, a new brand of home furnishings and accessories exclusive to JCPenney. The collection includes bedding, window coverings, bath, decorative accessories, table top, area rugs, lighting and wall d&eacute;cor. Furniture is also available in select markets. Also in September, we launched JOE Joseph Abboud&reg;, a comprehensive collection of mens sportswear, shirts, ties, tailored clothing, outerwear and footwear. JOE Joseph Abboud owned by JA Apparel Corp., owners of global lifestyle brand Joseph Abboud creates a neo traditional lifestyle category in Mens that caters to customers seeking designer casual, business casual and dressy attire at affordable prices. In addition, we launched she said, a contemporary, private label career sportswear brand focused on the professional career woman. In October 2009, we entered into an agreement with Liz Claiborne, Inc. to make JCPenney the exclusive department store retailer for Liz Claiborne branded merchandise, other than footwear and beauty products, starting in fall 2010. Following the complete roll out of the Liz Claiborne and Claiborne for Men brands, JCPenney will carry a full lifestyle collection in more than 30 merchandise categories. Our customer research shows that the Liz Claiborne brand is one of the most recognized and purchased brands in womens apparel, with exceptional customer loyalty. In November, we launched a preview collection of Olsenboye, an exclusive new juniors brand created by Dualstar Entertainment Group founders and designers Mary Kate Olsen and Ashley Olsen. The preview collection was available for a limited time on jcp.com and in select JCPenney stores. The full launch is in spring 2010. Also in November, we announced plans to become Mangos exclusive department store retailer in the United States for the MNG by Mango brand. Mango, with more than 1,300 stores in 94 countries, is known for rapidly delivering European runway fashion at affordable prices. MNG by Mango is expected to become our largest contemporary brand and it will bring a representation of Mango fashion to JCPenney and will expand the brands presence in the United States. MNG by Mango will launch in fall 2010 on jcp.com and in approximately 80 stores, with plans to expand to a total of 600 stores by the end of 2011. Marketing Initiatives In February 2009, we launched our spring marketing campaign showcasing our compelling selection of affordable, exclusive designer brands. The campaign kicked off with commercials at the 2009 Academy Awards featuring several authentic designers from our portfolio, including nicole&reg; by Nicole Miller, Bisou Bisou&reg; by Michele Bohbot, ALLEN B. by Allen Schwartz, Fabulosity by Kimora Lee Simmons and I Heart Ronson by Charlotte Ronson. Our spring campaign reflected our efforts to deliver brands that inspire and enable customers to have exceptional style and quality at affordable prices. We also launched an interactive, fully integrated virtual runway shop on jcp.com featuring some of our exclusive designers. Our fully integrated two year sponsorship of the Rascal Flatts American Living Unstoppable Tour presented by JCPenney kicked off in June 2009. The tour, which hits about 60 cities across the nation each year, promoted American Living during 2009, our affordable, all American lifestyle brand developed exclusively for our customers by Polo Ralph Laurens Global Brand Concepts with offerings across nearly 40 merchandise categories. 21 Table of Contents In July 2009, we launched our Back to School marketing campaign, Schooled in Style Smart Looks for LessTM, that included digital, social, mobile and traditional media with special events and promotions to support the merchandise in our portfolio of exclusive and private brands. In keeping pace with our consumers changing media habits and their continued migration to online versus catalog shopping, in November 2009, we announced our plans to discontinue publishing our twice yearly big book catalogs. Instead, we will invest those resources in continued target growth initiatives on jcp.com, ongoing leading edge social media services and a range of customized, more timely specialty catalogs. This redirection also aligns with our ongoing commitment to promote the sustainability of forests and to operate in a socially responsible manner. We expect a year over year reduction of 25% to 30% in paper use for catalogs in 2010, continuing our four year trend of declining paper consumption. Customer Service In January 2010, the American Express/NRF Foundation 2009 Customer Service Survey ranked JCPenney first in customer service among department store retailers for the second year in a row. The positive results reflect the efforts made by our CustomerFIRST initiatives launched Company wide in 2008. Gross Margin Gross margin is a measure of profitability of a retail company at the most fundamental level of buying and selling merchandise and measures a companys ability to effectively manage the total costs of sourcing and allocating merchandise against the corresponding retail pricing designed to offer quality merchandise at smart prices. Gross margins not only cover marketing, selling and other operating expenses, but also must include a profit element to reinvest back into the business. Gross margin is the difference between total net sales and cost of the goods sold and is typically expressed as a percentage of total net sales. The cost of goods sold includes all direct costs of bringing merchandise to its final selling destination. These costs include: cost of the merchandise (net of discounts or allowances earned) freight warehousing sourcing and procurement buying and brand development costs, including buyers salaries and related expenses merchandise examination inspection and testing merchandise distribution center expenses shipping and handling costs incurred related to Direct sales to customers ($ in millions) 2009 2008 Gross margin $ 6,910 $ 6,915 As a percent of sales 39.4 % 37.4 % Gross margin increased 200 basis points to 39.4% of sales in 2009 and exceeded our previous historical high annual gross margin rate. On a dollar basis, gross margin declined only $5 million, or 0.1%, to $6,910 million, despite the $930 million, or 5.0%, decline in total net sales for the year. The gross margin rate improved significantly as we effectively controlled inventory and planned for lower sales levels with reductions in both clearance selling and unprofitable discounting. In addition, sourcing costs were slightly lower for the year. 22 Table of Contents In 2009, we elected to change our method of valuing inventory to the FIFO method from the LIFO method. The effect of the change was immaterial to our results with an increase to gross margin of approximately $2 million. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses The following costs are included in SG&A expenses, except if related to merchandise buying, sourcing, warehousing or distribution activities: salaries marketing occupancy and rent utilities and maintenance information technology administrative costs related to our home office, district and regional operations credit card fees real, personal property and other taxes (excluding income taxes) ($ in millions) 2009 2008 SG&A expenses $ 5,382 $ 5,395 As a percent of sales 30.7 % 29.2 % SG&A expenses declined $13 million to $5,382 million compared to $5,395 million in 2008. However, due to lower sales in 2009, SG&A expenses were not leveraged and increased 150 basis points to 30.7% as a percent of sales compared to 29.2% in 2008. Marketing costs declined $147 million, or 50 basis points as a percent of sales, compared to last year, as we realigned advertising resources to better leverage media to reach our customers, which led to discontinuing certain unprofitable promotions and reducing catalog book costs as planned by reducing total page count and books circulated. Our SG&A expenses also benefited this year from the $11 million final distribution of the Visa Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litigation settlement. Offsetting the decline in expenses were higher incentive compensation accruals covering approximately 7,500 associates due to better than planned sales and operating income as well as a special recognition bonus program for over 100,000 mostly store based hourly associates, which in the aggregate increased SG&A expenses about 100 basis points as a percent of sales. Additionally, other store expenses, including salaries, facility management and occupancy costs were well managed throughout the organization despite approximately $115 million of incremental costs associated with non comparable stores; however, due to sales levels, costs were not leveraged and increased approximately 100 basis points as a percent of sales. Pension Expense/(Income) ($ in millions) 2009 2008 Primary pension plan expense/(income) $ 298 $ (133 ) Supplemental pension plans expense 39 43 Total pension plans expense/(income) $ 337 $ (90 ) Total pension plan expense was $337 million in 2009 compared to total pension plan income of $90 million in 2008, and consisted mainly of the primary pension plan expense of $298 million in 2009 versus primary pension plan income of $133 million in 2008, resulting in a negative swing of $431 million, or $1.16 per share on an after tax basis. The expense is primarily the result of the amortization of the primary pension plans unrealized losses due to the significant decline in plan assets in 2008. On May 18, 2009, we voluntarily contributed JCPenney common stock valued at $340 million to our 23 Table of Contents primary pension plan. Along with the contribution, and to reflect updated pension assumptions relating to the pension liability, we remeasured the plans assets and obligations as of the date of the contribution. Based on the new measurement, the net periodic pension plan expense for 2009 was reduced by $24 million to $298 million from the original estimate of $322 million. Based on our year end 2009 measurement of primary pension plan assets and benefit obligations, we expect our 2010 non cash primary pension plan expense to be approximately $221 million, or $0.57 per share. Depreciation and Amortization Expenses As expected with the addition of new stores and investments in renovating existing stores, depreciation and amortization expenses in 2009 increased $26 million to $495 million, or approximately 5.5%, compared to $469 million in 2008. Pre Opening Expense Pre opening expense, which includes advertising, hiring and training costs for new associates, processing and stocking initial merchandise inventory and rental costs prior to store opening was $28 million for 2009 compared to $31 million in 2008. We opened 17 new stores in 2009 compared to 35 in 2008. Relative to the number of stores opened, the pre opening expenses for 2009 were significantly higher than last year primarily due to the recognition of rent expense (level rent) during the construction period associated with our Manhattan store in New York City, which opened in late July 2009. Real Estate and Other, Net ($ in millions) 2009 2008 Real estate activities $ (34) $ (39) Net gains from sale of real estate (2) (10) Impairments and other 41 24 Total expense/(income) $ 5 $ (25) Real estate and other consists primarily of ongoing operating income from our real estate subsidiaries, as well as net gains from the sale of facilities and equipment that are no longer used in our operations, other non operating corporate charges and credits and asset impairments. Real estate and other was a net charge of $5 million in 2009 versus income of $25 million in 2008, declining $30 million primarily as a result of higher impairment charges and lower net gains from the sale of real estate in 2009. Impairments in 2009 totaled $42 million and included seven underperforming department stores and other corporate assets. Of the seven stores, three will continue to operate in their existing locations while the remaining stores are candidates for relocation or closure. Impairments were $21 million in 2008 primarily related to a department store, a real estate joint venture and other corporate assets. Operating Income Operating income declined 230 basis points to 3.8% of sales in 2009 compared to 6.1% last year. Excluding the non cash impact of the primary pension plan, adjusted operating income (non GAAP), increased 10 basis points to 5.5% of sales compared to 5.4% in 2008. 24 Table of Contents Net Interest Expense Net interest expense consists principally of interest expense on long term debt, net of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents. Net interest expense was $260 million, an increase of $35 million, or 15.6%, from $225 million in 2008. The increase in net interest expense was due primarily to a significant decline in the weighted average annual interest rate earned on short term investment balances to 0.1% in 2009 from 1.6% in 2008. Interest income on short term investments was $3 million in 2009 compared to $32 million in 2008. Net interest expense for the year also reflected higher credit line fees related to our new 2009 Credit Facility, offset by lower long term interest expense due to lower average long term debt as a result of our debt repayment in mid 2008 and repurchases of debt in 2009. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate for continuing operations for 2009 was 38.2% compared with 37.7% for 2008. The tax rate increase was due to the lower level of pre tax income as well as state audit activity and state income tax legislative changes enacted during the year. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations in 2009 generated a credit of $2 million, net of $1 million of income tax expense, or $0.01 per share, compared to a credit of $5 million, or $0.03 per share, in 2008, and was primarily the result of our ongoing review and true up of reserves related to previous discontinued operations. These previous discontinued operations are no longer expected to have a future material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Income from Continuing Operations Income from continuing operations for 2009 declined 56.1% to $249 million, or $1.07 per share, compared with $567 million, or $2.54 per share, last year. Excluding the non cash impact of the primary pension plan, adjusted income from continuing operations (non GAAP) decreased 10.5% to $433 million, or $1.86 per share, compared to $484 million, or $2.17 per share, for 2008. Other Significant Events in 2009 In November 2009, we extended our private label credit card program agreement with GE Money Bank for an initial four year term with the option for two year renewals. The Company continues to benefit by generating sales on the card pursuant to this non recourse program. Additionally, we will receive an annual signing bonus and may generate revenue from an application bounty program and gain share calculation. Either party may terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of certain events. 2008 Compared to 2007 Total Net Sales ($ in millions) 2008 2007 Total net sales $ 18,486 $ 19,860 Sales percent (decrease)/increase Total net sales (6.9)% (0.2)% Comparable store sales (8.5)% 0.0 % Sales per gross square foot(1) $ 160 $ 177 (1) Calculation includes the sales of stores that were open for the full fiscal year as of each year end, as well as online sales through jcp.com. 25 Table of Contents Total net sales declined $1,374 million in 2008 compared to 2007. The following table provides the components of the net sales decline: ($ in millions) 2008 Comparable store sales decline $ (1,541) Sales of new stores 617 Sales of closed stores (183) Sales decline through catalog print media and outlet stores (267) 2008 total net sales decline $ (1,374) In 2008, comparable store sales declined 8.5% as a result of a sharp slow down in consumer spending. Sales through catalog print media and outlet stores also declined, while sales of non comparable stores opened in 2008 and 2009, net of closings, added $434 million. In 2008, we opened 26 net new stores (35 stores, net of 9 closings and relocations) and in 2007 we opened 34 net new stores (50 stores, net of 16 closings and relocations.) All components combined, total net sales decreased 6.9% in 2008 compared to 2007. Over the course of 2008, the worsening consumer spending environment resulted in reduced sales from 5.4% lower traffic in our mall stores compared to the prior year. Our off mall traffic was also down compared to 2007 but had stronger traffic trends than our mall stores. Consistent with the difficult retail environment and the pronounced decrease in consumer spending, the number of transactions and the number of units sold declined for the year. Geographically, the best performing regions for 2008 were the central and northwest regions, while the southeast and southwest regions delivered the weakest performance. Sales of jcp.com, which are included in comparable stores sales, were essentially flat with 2007 at about $1.5 billion. Although consumer spending steadily decreased over the year, we continued our leadership position in apparel, bringing style and newness through the launch of several private and exclusive brands. For the year, family shoes, along with womens apparel and accessories were the best performing divisions. By contrast, and consistent with industry results, fine jewelry and home were the weakest businesses. Private and exclusive brands found only at JCPenney increased in 2008 to approximately 52% of total merchandise sales compared to 49% in 2007. Total Net Sales Mix The following percentages represent the mix of total net sales: 2008 2007 Womens apparel 24 % 23 % Home 20 % 21 % Mens apparel and accessories 19 % 20 % Childrens apparel 11 % 11 % Womens accessories, including Sephora 10 % 9 % Family footwear 6 % 6 % Fine jewelry 5 % 5 % Services and other 5 % 5 % 100 % 100 % In 2008, we opened 44 new Sephora inside JCPenney locations, which brought the total to 91 locations compared to 47 at the end of 2007. 26 Table of Contents Merchandise Initiatives In February 2008, we launched American Living&reg;, a new updated traditional lifestyle brand created exclusively for JCPenney by Polo Ralph Laurens Global Brand Concepts. American Living&reg; is in the higher quality and pricing segment of our offerings across 40 merchandise categories for women, men and children, as well as shoes, accessories and home goods. In April 2008, we launched Linden Street, which was the most comprehensive home brand launch in our history. It is a blend of traditional and contemporary styles offering a classic, timeless design. For the Back to School season, in juniors, we launched private brand Decree&reg;, a denim inspired line of apparel for girls and young women, and Fabulosity, a complete line of sportswear designed by Kimora Lee Simmons. For young mens, we extended the exclusive American Living&reg; brand with new denim, graphic t shirts and jackets, and launched White Tag&reg;, a new urban rock inspired national brand of premium denim and art driven t shirts. In addition to the new fashion brands for Back to School, we introduced Dorm Life, a new private modern lifestyle brand in the home division featuring merchandise to furnish a college dorm or off campus housing. In October 2008, we announced the significant enhancement of the longstanding and highly successful career brands Worthington&reg; for women and Stafford&reg; for men, to retain longtime customers and to attract new shoppers. We updated the private brands with new categories, fits and fabrics that overlap seasons. Marketing Initiatives In July and November 2008, we supported the apparel launches with integrated marketing campaigns featuring the new brands. The campaigns targeted teens and included both traditional ads and non traditional media components, such as in cinema ads and mobile phone marketing, emails, web search and targeted direct mail and catalog. The messages were coordinated across all lines of the business, stores and Direct that represent an alignment of our offerings and provide a seamless shopping experience for customers. Customer Service Initiatives During 2008, store associates participated in CustomerFIRST, a training program focused on delivering extraordinary customer service that empowers associates to exceed customers expectations when they shop at our stores. Results of the CustomerFIRST program were positive. Based on consumer research, customers ranked us number one when asked about customer service, sales associate availability and whether they are treated with respect by sales associates. In January 2009, the American Express/NRF Foundation 2008 Customer Service Survey placed us first in customer service among department store retailers. Gross Margin ($ in millions) 2008 2007 Gross margin $ 6,915 $ 7,671 As a percent of sales 37.4 % 38.6 % Gross margin declined by $756 million, or 120 basis points as a percentage of sales, in 2008. The decline was a result of a decrease in unit sales, as well as a decrease in average unit retail. The lower average unit retail reflected higher markdowns from increased clearance activity in response to softer sales and to achieve desired levels of inventory. 27 Table of Contents SG&A Expenses ($ in millions) 2008 2007 SG&A expenses $ 5,395 $ 5,402 As a percent of sales 29.2 % 27.2 % SG&A expenses were well managed across the entire organization in 2008, decreasing $7 million despite the addition of 26 net new stores. In 2008, we realized the first full year of benefit from our workforce management tool that facilitates efficient staffing levels. The rollout of this tool provided a positive impact on associate productivity, as well as store payroll expense. Store salaries declined on a dollar basis, but were not leveraged against sales and increased about 40 basis points as a percent of sales. Total marketing costs were slightly under the prior year, but as a percent of sales increased 50 basis points. In addition, despite approximately $160 million of incremental costs associated with non comparable stores, all other expenses, including store occupancy and utility expenses were well managed, but were up about 110 basis points. Total SG&A expenses as a percent of sales experienced approximately 200 basis points of de leveraging as a result of the sales decline. Pension (Income)/Expense ($ in millions) 2008 2007 Primary pension plan (income) $ (133) $ (97) Supplemental pension plans expense 43 52 Total pension plans (income) $ (90) $ (45) Total pension income doubled to $90 million in 2008 from $45 million in the prior year. The main driver of the increase was the primary pension plan income due to asset growth from strong capital market returns as measured on February 3, 2008. Depreciation and Amortization Expenses Depreciation and amortization expenses in 2008 increased $43 million to $469 million, or approximately 10.1% compared to $426 million in 2007, reflecting new store openings and store renovations. Pre Opening Expense During 2008, we opened 35 new stores compared to 50 in 2007. As a result, pre opening expense decreased to $31 million from $46 million. Real Estate and Other, Net ($ in millions) 2008 2007 Real estate activities $ (39) $ (39) Net gains from sale of real estate (10) (10) Impairments and other 24 3 Total (income) $ (25) $ (46) 28 Table of Contents Real estate and other was a net credit of $25 million in 2008, a decrease of $21 million compared to the previous year due to 2008 impairments primarily related to a department store, which continued to operate, a real estate joint venture and other corporate assets. Operating Income Operating income for 2008 decreased $753 million, or 340 basis points, to 6.1% of sales compared to 9.5% of sales in 2007, reflecting pressure from the weak sales environment and increased promotional levels throughout the year and holiday season. Excluding the non cash impact of the primary pension plan income, adjusted operating income (non GAAP), decreased $789 million, or 360 basis points, to 5.4% of sales in 2008 compared to 9.0% in the previous year. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense was $225 million, an increase of $72 million, or 47.1%, from $153 million in 2007. The increase in net interest expense was due primarily to a decline in the weighted average annual interest rate earned on short term investments to 1.6% in 2008 from 5.0% in 2007, combined with a decrease in average outstanding short term investments. Interest income on short term investments was $32 million in 2008 compared to $113 million in 2007. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate for continuing operations for 2008 was 37.7% compared with 35.9% for 2007. The 2007 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the release of $38 million, or $0.17 per share, of income tax reserves resulting from the favorable resolution of prior year tax matters. Income from Continuing Operations Income from continuing operations for 2008 declined 48.7% to $567 million, or $2.54 per share, compared with $1,105 million, or $4.90 per share, in 2007. Excluding the non cash impact of the primary pension plan, adjusted income from continuing operations (non GAAP) decreased 53.6% to $484 million, or $2.17 per share, compared to $1,043 million, or $4.63 per share, for 2007. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations in 2008 was a credit of $5 million, or $0.03 per share, compared to $6 million, or $0.03 per share, in 2007, and was primarily the result of our ongoing review and true up of reserves related to previous discontinued operations. 29 Table of Contents Financial Condition and Liquidity Overview In 2009, our full year results led to a significant improvement in our financial position. We improved our cash flow metrics and retained the flexibility to complete our Bridge Plan initiatives. Our ability to execute our Bridge Plan sustained our financial position and financial flexibility, which have enhanced our competitive position and should allow us to take advantage of future opportunities as the economic environment improves. The foundation of our strong liquidity position is our cash and cash equivalent balances and our ability to generate positive free cash flow (non GAAP). For 2009, we ended the year with $3.0 billion of cash and cash equivalent balances and had positive free cash flow of $806 million, an improvement of $785 million compared to 2008. Our liquidity position is further enhanced by ending the period with a significantly increased cash to debt ratio over the prior year. At year end 2009, our cash to debt ratio was 89%, up from 67% at year end 2008. Subsequent to year end, we used cash on hand to retire the current maturity of $393 million of debt on March 1, 2010. Our next scheduled debt maturity of $230 million will occur in August 2012. In addition to cash flow and cash and cash equivalent balances, which are sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, our existing credit facility provides an additional $750 million source of liquidity. Other than the issuance of trade and standby letters of credit, which totaled $134 million at year end 2009, we have not utilized this facility nor do we expect to do so in 2010. The following table provides a summary of our key components and ratios of financial condition and liquidity: ($ in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,011 $ 2,352 $ 2,532 Merchandise inventory 3,024 3,259 3,641 Property and equipment, net 5,357 5,367 4,959 Long term debt, including current maturities $ 3,392 $ 3,505 $ 3,708 Stockholders equity 4,778 4,155 5,312 Total capital $ 8,170 $ 7,660 $ 9,020 Additional amounts available under our credit agreements 750 1,200 1,200 Cash flow from operating activities of continuing operations 1,576 (1) 1,155 1,249 (2) Free cash flow (non GAAP)(3) 806 (1) 21 (142 )(2) Capital expenditures 600 969 1,243 Dividends paid 183 178 174 Ratios and measures: Debt to total capital (non GAAP)(4) 41.5 % 45.8 % 41.1 % Cash to debt(5) 88.8 % 67.1 % 68.3 % (1) Included a $131 million tax benefit as a result of the contribution of common stock to the primary pension plan. (2) Included a $110 million tax benefit that was realized in 2007 for the $300 million discretionary cash contribution made to the primary pension plan in 2006. (3) See Item 6, Selected Financial Data, for a discussion of this non GAAP financial measure and reconciliation to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. (4) Long term debt, including current maturities divided by total capital. (5) Cash and cash equivalents divided by long term debt, including current maturities. 30 Table of Contents Cash and Cash Equivalents At year end 2009, we had $3.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents, which represented 89% of our $3.4 billion of outstanding long term debt. As of January 30, 2010, we had a current maturity of $393 million principal amount of 8% Notes due March 1, 2010. Cash and cash equivalents increased $659 million in 2009 after using $113 million to purchase long term debt through tender offer and open market purchases. Our cash investments are held in U.S. Treasury money market funds and a portfolio of highly rated bank deposits. In addition to cash and cash equivalents, our liquidity position includes a three year $750 million revolving credit facility that was put in place in April 2009 (2009 Credit Agreement). Our liquidity is further enhanced by the fact that our current debt portfolio and material lease agreements contain no provisions that could trigger acceleration of payments or collateral support in the event of adverse changes in our financial condition. However, our 2007 debt issuances contain a change of control provision that would obligate us, at the holders option, to repurchase the debt at a price of 101% if there was a beneficial ownership change of 50% or more of our common stock and the debt was rated non investment grade. This provision applies to $1 billion of our debt. Free Cash Flow (non GAAP) Free cash flow (non GAAP) is defined as cash flow from operating activities of continuing operations less capital expenditures and dividends paid, plus proceeds from the sale of assets. Our 2009 free cash flow improved $785 million to $806 million compared to $21 million in 2008, primarily due to the effective execution of our Bridge Plan to control inventory levels and moderate capital expenditures. Operating Activities of Continuing Operations Our operations are seasonal in nature, with the business depending to a great extent on the last quarter of the year when a significant portion of the sales, profits and positive operating cash flows are realized. Cash requirements are highest in the third quarter as we build inventory levels in preparation for the holiday season. During 2009, our peak cash requirements declined as planned as we reduced 2009 merchandise receipts. We expect peak cash requirements to increase in 2010 for merchandise receipts, as we plan for modest sales growth, and the resulting increase in working capital requirements. 2009 cash flow from operating activities of continuing operations was $1,576 million, an increase of $421 million as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily attributable to a decline in working capital requirements from lower levels of inventory, net of merchandise accounts payable and significantly higher accruals for incentive compensation. Total inventory was $3,024 million at the end of 2009, down 7.2% from last year, primarily as a result of our effective inventory management in response to the challenging business environment and our conservative inventory plan based upon expected lower sales. Our 2009 inventory plan resulted in lower levels of clearance merchandise that, when combined with better inventory turns, resulted in improved margins. On a comparable store basis, inventories were down approximately 7.7% from last year, including inventory for re launching our private brands and launching exclusive designer brands and the continued expansion of Sephora inside JCPenney. In response to the soft selling environment, we managed merchandise inventory down to desirable levels by reducing merchandise receipts. We believe that the inventory level at the end of 2009 is appropriately balanced as we plan our 2010 inventory investment to support sales growth. Inventory turns for 2009, 2008 and 2007 were 3.15, 3.06 and 3.14, respectively. 31 Table of Contents The increase in the incentive compensation accruals for 2009 resulted from better than planned results for both sales and operating profit and improvements in total customer satisfaction scores. 2008 cash flow from operating activities of continuing operations decreased compared to 2007 as the result of a decline in income from continuing operations impacted by the weakened consumer spending environment largely offset by effective inventory management. Investing Activities of Continuing Operations ($ in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Net cash (used)/provided by: Capital expenditures $ (600 ) $ (969 ) $ (1,243 ) Proceeds from sale of assets 13 13 26 Investing activities $ (587 ) $ (956 ) $ (1,217 ) In 2009, we had capital expenditures of $600 million, used for opening 17 new stores, 16 in our off mall format and our store in Manhattan, 64 new Sephora inside JCPenney locations, 20 major capital improvements and 22 store refurbishments, as well as investments in technology. In 2008, we had capital expenditures of $969 million, used for opening 35 new or relocated stores, 31 in our off mall format, and 44 Sephora inside JCPenney locations. We also completed significant fixturing and store environment improvements in about 600 stores, as well as 24 major renovations and 90 store refurbishments. In 2007, capital expenditures were $1,243 million, used for opening 50 new stores, 16 of which were relocations, modernizing 65 existing stores and adding 42 Sephora inside JCPenney locations. The following provides a breakdown of capital expenditures: ($ in millions) 2009 2008 2007 New and relocated stores $ 163 $ 460 $ 687 Store renewals and updates 195 322 389 Capitalized software 72 66 46 Technology and other 170 (1) 121 121 Total $ 600 $ 969 $ 1,243 (1) Included $31 million for the repurchase of 12 stores that were originally part of sale leaseback transactions. We expect 2010 capital expenditures to be approximately $500 million and be funded with cash flow from operations and existing cash and cash equivalent balances. Financing Activities of Continuing Operations ($ in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Net cash (used) in: Financing activities $ (327 ) $ (380 ) $ (286 ) 32 Table of Contents In 2009, pursuant to our cash tender offer to purchase up to $200 million aggregate principal amount of JCPs outstanding 8% Notes due March 1, 2010 (Notes), we accepted for purchase on May 12, 2009, $104 million principal amount of the Notes. We paid $107 million aggregate consideration, including accrued and unpaid interest, for the accepted Notes on May 13, 2009. In addition, we purchased $9 million of these Notes in the open market on July 10, 2009. There were no issuances of new debt during 2009. We paid financing costs of $32 million, which consisted of fees related to our 2009 Credit Facility and premiums on early retirement of debt from our cash tender offer. In 2009, we maintained our quarterly dividend on common stock at $0.20 per share and returned $183 million to stockholders through dividend payments. The Board reviews the dividend policy and rate, taking into consideration our overall financial and strategic outlook, earnings, liquidity and cash flow projections, as well as competitive factors. The Board approves and declares dividends on a quarterly basis. During 2008, cash payments on long term debt, including capital leases, totaled $203 million and consisted primarily of the August 2008 payment at maturity of $200 million outstanding principal amount of JCPs 7.375% Notes due 2008. During 2008, we returned $178 million to stockholders through dividend payments. During 2007, we received $980 million in proceeds from the issuance of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount in new senior notes, which was used in 2007 and 2008 for debt payments and general corporate purposes. Cash payments for long term debt, including capital leases and early retirement premiums in 2007, totaled $746 million. Also during 2007, we returned to stockholders $574 million through common stock repurchases of $400 million and $174 million in dividends. Cash Flow and Financing Outlook In 2010, our financing strategy will continue to focus on opportunities to maintain and further strengthen our financial position, improve our credit profile and deliver value to stockholders. Our strong financial position provides continued financial flexibility and enables us to strengthen our competitive and financial position proactively when the environment improves. While we expect the economic environment to remain challenging for the consumer, our operating and capital expenditure plans have been adjusted to reflect current operating conditions, while continuing to reinvest capital into the business. Capital expenditures are planned at $500 million for the year, which includes two new department stores and 75 new Sephora inside JCPenney locations. Other than the $393 million debt paid at maturity on March 1, 2010, we have no debt maturities until August 2012. We do not expect to borrow under our credit facility except to support ongoing letters of credit, and we will fund our capital expenditures and debt payments with operating cash flows in 2010, as well as the cash investment balances available at the beginning of the year. In accordance with our long term financing strategy, we manage our financial position on a multi year basis and may access the capital markets opportunistically. 2009 Credit Facility In April 2009, the Company, JCP and J. C. Penney Purchasing Corporation entered into a three year, $750 million revolving credit agreement (2009 Credit Facility) with a syndicate of lenders with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. The 2009 Credit Facility replaced our $1.2 billion credit facility that was scheduled to expire in April 2010. The new facility may be used for general corporate purposes and the issuance of letters of credit. 33 Table of Contents The 2009 Credit Facility is secured by our merchandise inventory, which security interest can be released upon attainment of certain credit rating levels. Pricing under the 2009 Credit Facility is tiered based on JCPs senior unsecured long term credit ratings issued by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poors Ratings Services. JCPs obligations under the 2009 Credit Facility are guaranteed by J. C. Penney Company, Inc. As of January 30, 2010, we were in compliance with the required financial covenants under the 2009 Credit Facility. As of such date, our leverage ratio was 2.3 to 1, not exceeding the 4 to 1 maximum requirement; our fixed charge coverage ratio was 3.4 to 1, exceeding the required minimum of 2.25 to 1; and our asset coverage ratio was 23 to 1, exceeding the required minimum of 3 to 1. In 2010, we do not expect to borrow under our 2009 Credit Facility other than to provide support for the issuance of letters of credit, which totaled $134 million at the end of 2009. Credit Ratings Our credit ratings and outlook as of March 22, 2010 were as follows: Long TermDebt Outlook Moodys Investors Service, Inc. Ba1 Stable Standard & Poors Ratings Services BB Stable Fitch Ratings BBB Stable Rating agencies consider changes in operating performance, comparable store sales, the economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, financial leverage and changes in our business strategy in their rating decisions. During 2009, the following credit rating actions were taken regarding our long term debt, credit facility and liquidity: Long Term Debt On April 1, 2009, Moodys Investors Service, Inc. revised our long term debt credit rating to Ba1 from Baa3 resulting from the impact on retailers from the slowdown in consumer spending. On April 8, 2009, Fitch Ratings affirmed our long term debt credit rating at investment grade of BBB , citing our strong liquidity, which is supported by our management of inventory and capital expenditures. On April 16, 2009, Standard and Poors Ratings Services revised our credit rating to BB from BBB citing their deepening concern about the impact of the U.S. recession and weakening consumer confidence on the department store sector. Credit Facility On April 8, 2009, Fitch Ratings assigned a rating of BBB to our 2009 Credit Facility, reflecting the higher priority status of the facility relative to the Companys unsecured debt securities due to the security interest in our inventory granted under the 2009 Credit Facility. In early April 2009, Moodys Investors Service, Inc. assigned a Baa1 rating to our 2009 Credit Facility. 34 Table of Contents Liquidity On April 1, 2009 Moodys Investors Service, Inc. assigned their highest liquidity rating of SGL 1 to the Company. Contractual Obligations and Commitments Aggregated information about our obligations and commitments to make future contractual payments, such as debt and lease agreements, and contingent commitments as of January 30, 2010 is presented in the following table.

See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements. 35 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Management considers all on and off balance sheet debt in evaluating our overall liquidity position and capital structure. Other than operating leases, which are included in the Contractual Obligations and Commitments table, we do not have any off balance sheet financing. See detailed disclosure regarding operating leases and their off balance sheet present value in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. As part of the 2001 sale of the assets of our Direct Marketing Services subsidiary, JCP signed a guarantee agreement with a maximum exposure of $20 million. Any potential claims or losses are first recovered from established reserves, then from the purchaser and finally from any state insurance guarantee fund before JCPs guarantee would be invoked. As a result, we do not believe that any potential exposure would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We do not have any additional arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements. Common Stock During 2007 to 2009, the number of outstanding shares of common stock changed as follows, primarily as a result of our stock contribution to the Companys Pension Plan in 2009 and common stock repurchases in 2007: (shares in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Outstanding at beginning of the year 222 222 226 Contribution to Companys pension plan 13 Repurchase and retirement of common stock (5 ) Exercise of stock options and vesting of share based payments 1 1 Outstanding at end of year 236 222 222 Common Stock Repurchases As authorized by the Board in March 2007 and funded with cash proceeds from employee stock option exercises and existing cash and cash equivalent balances, we repurchased 5.1 million shares of common stock for $400 million during the second quarter of 2007. Common stock was retired on the same day it was repurchased. There are no outstanding Board authorizations to repurchase common stock. 36 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that we make estimates and use assumptions that in some instances may materially affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments based on history and current trends, as well as other factors that we believe are relevant at the time of the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Historically, actual results have not differed materially from estimates; however, future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty and as a result, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates. We have discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to these policies in this MD&A. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of all of our significant accounting policies. Inventory Valuation under the Retail Method Inventories are valued primarily at the lower of cost (using the FIFO method) or market, determined by the retail method for department stores, store distribution centers and regional warehouses and standard cost, representing average vendor cost, for Direct. Under the retail method, retail values are converted to a cost basis by applying specific average cost factors to groupings of merchandise. The retail method inherently requires management judgment and certain estimates that may significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost, as well as gross margin. Two of the most significant estimates are permanent reductions to retail prices (markdowns) used to clear unproductive or slow moving inventory and inventory shortages (shrinkage). Permanent markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded at the point of decision, when the utility of inventory has diminished, versus the point of sale. Factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand, customer preferences, age of the merchandise and style trends. The corresponding reduction to gross margin is recorded in the period the decision is made. Shrinkage is estimated as a percent of sales for the period from the last inventory date to the end of the fiscal period. Physical inventories are taken at least annually and inventory records are adjusted accordingly. The shrinkage rate from the most recent physical inventory, in combination with current events and historical experience, is used as the standard for the shrinkage accrual rate for the next inventory cycle. We do not believe that the assumptions used in these estimates will change significantly based on prior experience. A 10% increase or decrease in the markdown reserve at year end 2009 would have impacted net income by approximately $7 million. A 10% increase or decrease in the estimated inventory shrinkage reserve at year end 2009 would have impacted net income by approximately $5 million. Valuation of Long Lived Assets We evaluate recoverability of long lived assets, such as property and equipment, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, such as historical operating losses or plans to close stores and dispose of or sell long lived assets before the end of their previously estimated useful lives. Additionally, for store assets, in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 37 Table of Contents we separately test the performance of individual stores and underperforming stores are selected for further evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying amounts. If the evaluation, performed on an undiscounted cash flow basis, indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, the potential impairment is measured as the excess of carrying value over the fair value of the impaired asset. The impairment calculation requires us to apply estimates for future cash flows and use judgments for qualitative factors such as local market conditions, operating environment, mall performance and other trends. For stores, we estimate fair value based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate that is considered commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model and for assets other than stores, we generally base fair value on either appraised value or projected discounted cash flows. We recognize an impairment loss in the period in which it occurs. The carrying value is adjusted to the new carrying value and any subsequent increases in fair value are not recorded. If it is determined that the estimated remaining useful life of the asset should be decreased, the periodic depreciation expense is adjusted based on the new carrying value of the asset. Impairment losses totaling $42 million, $21 million and $1 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, were recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in the real estate and other, net line item. The 2009 impairment charges include primarily seven department stores and other corporate assets. While we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate long lived asset impairments, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may be exposed to additional impairment charges, which could be material to our results of operations. Reserves and Valuation Allowances We are primarily self insured for costs related to workers compensation and general liability claims. The liabilities represent our best estimate, using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods through which we record a provision for workers compensation and general liability risk based on historical experience, current claims data and independent actuarial best estimates, including incurred but not reported claims and projected loss development factors. These estimates are subject to the frequency, lag and severity of claims. We target this provision above the midpoint of the actuarial range, and total estimated claim liability amounts are discounted using a risk free rate. We do not anticipate any significant change in loss trends, settlements or other costs that would cause a significant fluctuation in net income. However, a 10% variance in the workers compensation and general liability reserves at year end 2009 would have affected net income by approximately $16 million. Income taxes are estimated for each jurisdiction in which we operate and require significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. This involves assessing the current tax exposure together with temporary differences, which result from differing treatment of items for tax and book purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are provided for based on these assessments. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for recoverability based on estimated future taxable income. To the extent that recovery is deemed unlikely, a valuation allowance is recorded. We record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, in an income tax return. We recognize any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Significant judgment is required in assessing, among other things, the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. In assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets, we use estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income. Tax contingency accruals are evaluated and adjusted as appropriate, while taking into account the progress of audits of 38 Table of Contents various taxing jurisdictions. We do not expect the outcome of tax audits to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. Many years of data have been incorporated into the determination of tax reserves, and our estimates have historically been reasonable. In establishing our reserves for liabilities associated with underground storage tanks, we maintain and periodically update an inventory listing of potentially impacted sites. The estimated cost of remediation efforts is based on our historical experience, as well as industry and other published data. With respect to our former Eckerd operations, we accessed extensive databases of environmental matters, including data from the Environmental Protection Agency, to estimate the cost of remediation. Our experience, as well as relevant data, was used to develop a range of potential liabilities, and a reserve was established at the time of the Eckerd sale. The Eckerd reserve is adjusted as payments are made or new information becomes known. Reserves for asbestos removal are based on our known liabilities in connection with approved plans for store modernization, renovations, or dispositions of store locations. We believe the established reserves, as adjusted, are adequate to cover estimated potential liabilities. Pension Pension Accounting We maintain a qualified funded defined benefit pension plan (primary plan) and smaller non qualified unfunded supplemental defined benefit plans. The determination of pension expense is the result of actuarial calculations that are based on important assumptions about pension assets and liabilities. The most important of these are the rate of return on assets and the discount rate assumptions. These assumptions require significant judgment and a change in any one of them could have a significant effect on the pension expense reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, as well as in the assets, liability and equity sections of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following table reflects our rate of return and discount rate assumptions: 2009 2008 2007 Expected return on plan assets 8.4 % 8.9 % 8.9 % Discount rate for pension expense 6.86 %(1) 6.54 % 5.85 % Discount rate for pension obligation 5.90 % 6.95 % 6.46 % (1) For the first four months of 2009, the discount rate was 6.95% as determined by the January 31, 2009 annual measurement. The discount rate was revised to 6.86% on the remeasurement date of May 18, 2009. The supplemental plans and retiree medical plans used 6.95% for the year, since those plans were not subject to remeasurement. Return on Plan Assets and Impact on Earnings For the primary plan, we apply our expected return on plan assets using fair market value as of the annual measurement date. The fair market value method results in greater volatility to our pension expense than the more commonly used calculated value method (referred to as smoothing of assets). Our primary plan is well diversified with an asset allocation policy that currently provides for a targeted 65%, 25% and 10% mix of equities (U.S., non U.S. and private), fixed income (investment grade and high yield) and real estate (private and public), respectively. Previously, this allocation was 70%, 20% and 10%, respectively. The current allocation provides the primary plan with the appropriate balance of investment return and volatility risk, given the funded nature of the plan, our present and future liability characteristics and our long term investment horizon. 39 Table of Contents As of January 1, 2007, the primary plan was closed to new entrants. As a result of this action, the future liability will moderate and ultimately begin to decline after a period of several years. In recognition of the changing liability characteristics, we intend to decrease the plans allocation to equities and shift to less volatile fixed income assets. We anticipate this shift will occur over several years and will be dependent upon market conditions and plan characteristics. The higher fixed income allocation will better match the plans changing liability characteristics. As a result of recent negative returns in the capital markets and lower expected future returns, we reduced the expected rate of return assumption to 8.4% from 8.9% beginning in 2009. The actual rate of return for 2008 of a negative 30%, measured on January 31, 2009, versus the expected return on assets for 2008 resulted in a negative funded status of the primary plan of $275 million and a large increase in unrecognized losses that reduced equity through other comprehensive income. Discount Rate The discount rate assumption used to determine our postretirement obligations was based on an externally published yield curve determined by the plans actuary. The yield curve is a hypothetical AA yield curve represented by a series of bonds ranging in maturity from six months to 30 years, designed to match the corresponding pension benefit cash payments to retirees. Each underlying bond issue is required to have a rating of Aa2 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or a rating of AA or better by Standard & Poors Ratings Services. We believe the yield curve provides a better match to the timing and amount of expected benefit payments. For 2009, the discount rate initially increased to 6.95% from 6.54% as of January 31, 2009 and then slightly decreased to 6.86% from 6.95% for the May 18, 2009 remeasurement, which had an overall small positive impact on 2009 pension expense. The discount rate was adjusted in May as required for the remeasurement of plan assets and obligations to reflect the voluntary contribution of 13.4 million shares of JCPenney common stock and update other pension liability assumptions. The discount rate declined to 5.90% as of year end 2009, partially offsetting the positive impact of the improved return on assets. Sensitivity The sensitivity of the pension expense to a plus or minus one half of one percent of expected return on assets is a decrease or increase in expense of approximately $0.05 per share. An increase or decrease in the discount rate of one half of one percent would decrease or increase the expense by approximately $0.10 per share. Pension Funding Funding requirements for our primary plan are determined under ERISA rules, as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. As a result of the strong funded status of the primary plan, we are not required to make contributions in 2010 or 2011. However, we may make discretionary voluntary contributions taking into account liquidity and capital resource availability and capital market conditions. Our funding policy is to maintain a well funded pension plan throughout all business and economic cycles. Maintaining a well funded plan over time provides additional financial flexibility, which includes lower pension expense and reduced cash contributions, especially in the event of a decline in the capital markets. In addition, a well funded plan assures associates of the plans and our financial ability to continue to provide competitive retirement benefits, while at the same time being cost effective. 40 Table of Contents Consistent with our discretionary contribution practice, on May 18, 2009, we voluntarily contributed approximately 13.4 million newly issued shares of JCPenney common stock to the primary plan. The contribution was valued at $340 million, based on a price of $25.39 per share, reflecting a 6.5% discount to the closing price of JCPenney common stock on May 18, 2009. In accordance with our historical contribution practice, we contributed $1.2 billion on a pre tax basis, or $300 million per year in 2006, 2004, 2003 and 2002. These contributions helped to mitigate the negative returns from the downward cycle experienced in 2008 and allowed the primary plan to continue to meet regulatory funding requirements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information This Annual Report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements made within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which reflect our current view of future events and financial performance. The words expect, plan, anticipate, believe, intend, should, will and similar expressions identify forward looking statements. Any such forward looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to be materially different from planned or expected results. Those risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions, including inflation, recession, unemployment levels, consumer spending patterns, credit availability and debt levels, changes in store traffic trends, the cost of goods, trade restrictions, changes in tariff, freight, paper and postal rates, changes in the cost of fuel and other energy and transportation costs, increases in wage and benefit costs, competition and retail industry consolidations, interest rate fluctuations, dollar and other currency valuations, risks associated with war, an act of terrorism or pandemic, and a systems failure and or security breach that results in the theft, transfer or unauthorized disclosure of customer, employee or Company information. Furthermore, our Company typically earns a disproportionate share of its operating income in the fourth quarter due to holiday buying patterns, and such buying patterns are difficult to forecast with certainty. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is impossible to predict the degree to which any such factors could cause actual results to differ materially from predicted results. For additional discussion on risks and uncertainties, see Item 1A, Risk Factors. We intend the forward looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K to speak only as of the date of this report and do not undertake to update or revise these projections as more information becomes available. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. We maintain a majority of our cash and cash equivalents in financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less. Such investments are subject to interest rate risk and may have a small decline in value if interest rates increase. Since the financial instruments are of short duration, a change of 100 basis points in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial condition. All of our outstanding long term debt as of January 30, 2010 is at fixed interest rates and would not be affected by interest rate changes. Future borrowings under our multi year revolving credit facility, to the extent that fluctuating rate loans were used, would be affected by interest rate changes. As of 41 Table of Contents January 30, 2010, no borrowings were outstanding under the facility other than the issuance of trade and standby letters of credit, which totaled $134 million. We do not believe that a change of 100 basis points in interest rates would have a material effect on our financial condition. The fair value of long term debt, including current maturities, is estimated by obtaining quotes from brokers or is based on current rates offered for similar debt. At January 30, 2010, long term debt, including current maturities, had a carrying value of $3.4 billion and a fair value of $3.3 billion. At January 31, 2009, long term debt had a carrying value of $3.5 billion and a fair value of $2.6 billion. The effects of changes in the U.S. equity and bond markets serve to increase or decrease the value of assets in our primary pension plan. Significant declines in pension assets during 2008 due to the sharp declines in the capital markets resulted in a negative funded status of $275 million in the primary pension plan at the end 2008. As a result of the discretionary contribution on May 18, 2009 of 13.4 million shares of JCPenney common stock valued on that date at $340 million, the funded status of the plan improved to approximately 100% versus 93% in the prior year. We seek to manage exposure to adverse equity and bond returns by maintaining diversified investment portfolios and utilizing professional investment managers.
