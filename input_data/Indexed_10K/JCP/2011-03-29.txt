Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion, which presents our results, should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, along with the unaudited Five Year Financial and Operations Summaries, the risk factors and the cautionary statement regarding forward looking information. Unless otherwise indicated, this Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) relates only to results from continuing operations, all references to earnings per share (EPS) are on a diluted basis and all references to years relate to fiscal years rather than to calendar years. Financial Reporting We remain committed to continuously improving the transparency of our financial reporting by providing stockholders with informative financial disclosures and presenting a clear and balanced view of our financial position and operating results. We continue to employ a reporting matrix that requires written certifications on a quarterly basis from a cross disciplined team of approximately 20 senior members of our management team who have responsibility for preparing, verifying and reporting corporate results. For this Annual Report on Form 10 K, we enhanced our financial reporting as follows: Supplemental cash flow information and significant non cash transactions have been moved from a footnote presentation to be more prominently included directly on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We combined several related footnotes that contained information about common stock and stockholders equity into a single footnote titled, Stockholders Equity. We addressed the new disclosure requirements to provide information on recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements, including significant transfers into and out of level one and level two categories. We simplified the content and presentation of Item 6, Selected Financial Data. We revised our definition and calculation of free cash flow (a non GAAP financial measure) to exclude discretionary pension contributions and any related cash tax effects, which more appropriately reflects our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities. In view of the growth of our JCP Rewards&reg; customer loyalty program in 2010, we added a significant accounting policy to describe the accounting for the program. Consistent with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting each fiscal year. In relation to these requirements, our external auditors expressed an unqualified opinion regarding the effective operation of our internal control over financial reporting. 16 Table of Contents Executive Overview Despite the continued economic weakness during the year, we began to see some improvement in the retail sector. Our comparable store sales were positive for each quarter of 2010 and grew 2.5% for the year, while total net sales grew 1.2%. Total sales were 130 basis points lower than comparable store sales due to the reduction in sales resulting from discontinuing catalog print media. The gross margin rate as a percent of sales decreased slightly to 39.2%, compared to last years historic peak of 39.4%; however, we leveraged operating expenses to grow operating income by $169 million. EPS from continuing operations of $1.59 was 48.6% higher than last year. Other key highlights for 2010 were as follows: We opened 76 Sephora inside jcpenney beauty boutiques to bring our total to 231 locations. We successfully launched the Liz Claiborne&reg; brand. We completed several financing transactions during the year that further strengthened our financial position and created additional financial flexibility to support our growth plans: We closed a public offering of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 5.65% Senior Notes due 2020 and used the net proceeds of approximately $392 million to make a voluntary cash contribution to our qualified pension plan. We accepted for purchase $300 million principal amount of outstanding 6.375% Senior Notes due 2036, which were validly tendered pursuant to a cash tender offer, and incurred approximately $20 million, or about $0.05 per share, in related expenses, consisting primarily of bond premiums paid. We recorded $32 million of restructuring charges, amounting to approximately $0.08 on a per share basis, primarily to reflect the write down of the catalog outlet stores, which are being exited, and related severance. Current Developments In February, our Board authorized a program to repurchase up to $900 million of our common stock. In March, our Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share to be paid to stockholders on May 2, 2011. The dividend rate remains unchanged from our previous quarterly dividend payment. To further enhance our liquidity, we plan to renew our revolving credit facility early in 2011, ahead of its maturity in 2012. 17 Table of Contents Results of Operations Three Year Comparison of Operating Performance (in millions, except EPS) 2010 2009 2008 Total net sales $ 17,759 $ 17,556 $ 18,486 Percent increase/(decrease) from prior year 1.2 % (5.0 )% (6.9 )% Comparable store sales increase/(decrease)(1) 2.5 % (6.3 )% (8.5 )% Gross margin 6,960 6,910 6,915 Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) 5,350 5,382 5,395 Pension expense/(income) 255 337 (90 ) Depreciation and amortization 511 495 469 Pre opening 8 28 31 Real estate and other, net 4 5 (25 ) Total operating expenses 6,128 6,247 5,780 Operating income 832 663 1,135 As a percent of sales 4.7 % 3.8 % 6.1 % Adjusted operating income (non GAAP)(2) 1,053 961 1,002 As a percent of sales 5.9 % 5.5 % 5.4 % Net interest expense 231 260 225 Bond premiums and unamortized costs 20 Income from continuing operations before income taxes 581 403 910 Income tax expense 203 154 343 Income from continuing operations $ 378 $ 249 $ 567 Adjusted income from continuing operations (non GAAP)(2) $ 513 $ 433 $ 484 Diluted EPS from continuing operations $ 1.59 $ 1.07 $ 2.54 Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations (non GAAP)(2) $ 2.16 $ 1.86 $ 2.17 Average shares used for diluted EPS 238 233 223 (1) Comparable store sales are presented on a 52 week basis and include sales from new and relocated stores that have been opened for 12 consecutive full fiscal months and online sales through jcp.com. Stores closed for an extended period are not included in comparable store sales calculations, while stores remodeled and minor expansions not requiring store closures remain in the calculations. Our definition and calculation of comparable store sales may differ from other companies in the retail industry. (2) See Item 6, Selected Financial Data, for a discussion of this non GAAP financial measure and reconciliation to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Income from continuing operations was $378 million, or $1.59 per share, in 2010 compared to $249 million, or $1.07 per share, in 2009 and $567 million, or $2.54 per share, in 2008. Results for 2010 reflected improved profitability achieved by delivering top line sales growth and leveraging operating expenses. Included in results were charges of $32 million, or $0.08 per share, for initial restructuring charges related primarily to the wind down of our catalog and outlet operations and the streamlining of our call center operations and custom decorating business. Operating expenses benefited from lower primary pension plan expense by $77 million, or approximately $0.22 per share. Earnings for 2010 were favorably impacted by the decrease of our effective income tax rate due to favorable resolution of certain state income tax audits and an increase in our federal wage tax credit. 18 Table of Contents Earnings for 2009 reflected the economic downturn as well as the significant increase in the non cash primary pension plan charge. Notwithstanding these impacts, results benefited significantly from gross margin improvement that reflected the success of our strategy to sell a greater portion of merchandise at regular promotional prices and less at clearance prices. Results for 2008 were impacted by pressure on gross margins in a highly promotional selling environment, particularly during the holiday season. Gross margin declined both in dollars and as a percentage of sales from the pressure of declining sales levels that resulted from the slowdown in consumer spending. The impact on operating income from lower gross margin was somewhat mitigated by effective control over operating expenses, despite incremental expenses related to new store openings. Excluding the non cash impact of our primary pension plan, adjusted income from continuing operations (non GAAP) was $513 million, or $2.16 per share, in 2010 compared with $433 million, or $1.86 per share, in 2009 and $484 million, or $2.17 per share, in 2008. 2010 Compared to 2009 Total Net Sales Our year to year change in total net sales is comprised of (a) sales from new stores net of closings and relocations including catalog print media and outlet store sales, referred to as non comparable store sales and (b) sales of stores opened in both years as well as online sales from jcp.com, referred to as comparable store sales. We consider comparable store sales to be a key indicator of our current performance measuring the growth in sales and sales productivity of existing stores. Positive comparable store sales contribute to greater leveraging of operating costs, particularly payroll and occupancy costs, while negative comparable store sales contribute to de leveraging of costs. Comparable store sales also have a direct impact on our total net sales and the level of cash flow. 2010 2009 Total net sales (in millions) $ 17,759 $ 17,556 Sales percent increase/(decrease) Total net sales 1.2 % (5.0 )% Comparable store sales 2.5 % (6.3 )% Sales per gross square foot(1) $ 153 $ 149 (1) Calculation includes the sales of stores that were open for the full fiscal year, as well as online sales through jcp.com. Total net sales increased $203 million in 2010 compared to 2009. The following table provides the components of the net sales increase: ($ in millions) 2010 Comparable store sales, including Internet $ 406 Sales of new (non comparable) stores, net 77 Sales decline through catalog print media and outlet stores (280 ) 2010 total net sales increase $ 203 In 2010, comparable store sales increased 2.5% mainly as customers responded to our new merchandise initiatives and the value offered through our private brands. Sales of non comparable stores opened in 2010 and 2009, net of closings, added $77 million. In 2010, we opened two new stores and closed four, while in 2009 we opened 17 new stores and closed or relocated two stores. As expected with the wind down of the catalog business, catalog print media and outlet store sales 19 Table of Contents declined in 2010. Internet sales, which are included in comparable store sales, increased 4.4% to slightly more than $1.5 billion for the year. All components combined, total net sales increased $203 million or 1.2% in the year. During 2010, the percent increase in our off mall store traffic exceeded the increase in our mall traffic, which was also above last years level. In addition, our conversion rates for both mall and off mall stores were above 2009 levels. Our average unit retail was down in 2010 compared to last year, primarily as a result of a greater portion of promotional sales in our mix this year and a higher proportion of sales in the good and better merchandise categories at lower price points than sales of merchandise in the best category at higher price points. For 2010, our unit sales, number of transactions and units per transaction were higher than last year. Sales in all geographic regions increased in 2010, with the best performance in the southeast and southwest regions with the weakest in the northwest and northeast regions. Our best performing categories were mens apparel and womens accessories, including Sephora. Home and womens apparel experienced the weakest performance for the year. Private and exclusive brands found only at jcpenney continue to grow and as a percent of total merchandise sales were 55% in 2010 versus 54% in 2009. Total Net Sales Mix The following percentages represent the mix of total net sales: 2010 2009 Womens apparel 24 % 24 % Mens apparel and accessories 20 % 19 % Home 18 % 19 % Womens accessories, including Sephora 12 % 11 % Childrens apparel 11 % 11 % Family footwear 7 % 7 % Fine jewelry 4 % 4 % Services and other 4 % 5 % 100 % 100 % During the year, we opened 76 Sephora inside jcpenney locations, bringing us to 231 locations compared to 155 at the end of 2009. We plan to open an additional 76 Sephora inside jcpenney locations in 2011. Merchandise Initiatives In 2010, we focused on improving our merchandise assortments through the following initiatives: In April, we introduced One KissTM, a new brand of fine jewelry by Cindy Crawford. In July, in time for the back to school shopping season, we launched UproarTM and Supergirl&reg; by Nastia. Uproar is a new private label brand in stores and jcp.com for girls and boys ages 9 to 13. Supergirl by Nastia, an exclusive jcpenney brand for girls 8 to 12 years old, was created through a partnership with Warner Bros. Consumer Products and five time Olympic medalist Nastia Liukin. In August, we launched Liz Claiborne, making jcpenney the exclusive department store for Liz&reg; branded merchandise in the United States and Puerto Rico. Liz Claiborne is available in all stores and jcp.com and consists of merchandise in approximately 30 categories, including womens and mens apparel, home and accessories. Also in August, we launched MNG by Mango&reg;, fast fashion merchandise consisting of career and casual womens sportswear, as well as handbags, accessories and footwear. MNG 20 Table of Contents by Mango is available exclusively at jcpenney and is available on jcp.com. At the end of the year, MNG by Mango was available in 77 stores, and is expected to reach a total of about 500 stores by the end of 2011. In September, we launched a new unique collaboration with People StyleWatch&reg;. People StyleWatch editors select Must Have items from jcpenneys fashion assortment, focusing on womens and juniors apparel, accessories and footwear. The items branded as Must Have items are displayed and clearly highlighted in jcpenney stores, online at jcp.com and through print and digital media. Displays are refreshed up to 10 times a year to showcase People StyleWatch Must Haves. In the fall, we became the exclusive department store retailer for the Call it Spring&reg; brand by The ALDO&reg; Group. Call it Spring was launched as a shop within a shop concept similar to Sephora and provides a collection of more than 300 styles of on trend footwear and accessories targeting younger, modern customers. Call it Spring is expected to be available in approximately 500 stores by the end of 2011. In October, we announced an alliance with Cond&eacute; Nast to launch Modern Bride, a concept devoted to providing style and exceptional customer service. In February 2011, we introduced the Modern Bride concept in our fine jewelry department, in time for Valentines Day, offering an expanded assortment of bridal jewelry including engagement rings and wedding bands. In November, we announced our newly created Growth Brands Division and our plans to pursue high potential opportunities in the retail sector, including both digital and store opportunities. The Growth Brands Division will be separate from our core jcpenney brand and will leverage our merchandising, marketing, product development, sourcing, IT, planning and allocation and consumer research capabilities. We announced three retail businesses that will debut under this division. In summer 2011, in partnership with Hearst Magazines, we will launch two online retail businesses: Gifting Grace, a comprehensive online gifting resource for women, and CLAD, aimed at men and offering an assortment of designer brands. We also plan to launch The Foundry Big & Tall Supply Co. with a website catering to the mens big & tall customer, followed by the opening of 10 stand alone specialty retail stores. Gross Margin Gross margin is a measure of profitability of a retail company at the most fundamental level of buying and selling merchandise and measures a companys ability to effectively manage the total costs of sourcing and allocating merchandise against the corresponding retail pricing designed to offer quality merchandise at compelling prices. Gross margins not only cover marketing, selling and other operating expenses, but also must include a profit element to reinvest back into the business. Gross margin is the difference between total net sales and cost of the merchandise sold and is typically expressed as a percentage of total net sales. The cost of merchandise sold includes all direct costs of bringing merchandise to its final selling destination. These costs include: cost of the merchandise (net of discounts or allowances earned) freight warehousing sourcing and procurement buying and brand development costs including buyers salaries and related expenses merchandise examination inspection and testing merchandise distribution center expenses shipping and handling costs incurred related to sales to customers 21 Table of Contents ($ in millions) 2010 2009 Gross margin $ 6,960 $ 6,910 As a percent of sales 39.2 % 39.4 % Gross margin decreased slightly to 39.2% of sales, or 20 basis points, in 2010 compared to 2009s historical high annual gross margin rate of 39.4%. On a dollar basis, gross margin increased $50 million, or 0.7%, to $6,960 million compared to $6,910 million last year. The gross margin rate decreased due to higher markdowns from increased promotional activity that were somewhat offset by increased vendor support and lower year over year shrinkage, as a result of our shrinkage reduction initiatives. The gross margin level was also negatively impacted by the elimination of catalog print media. Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses The following costs are included in SG&A expenses, except if related to merchandise buying, sourcing, warehousing or distribution activities: salaries marketing occupancy and rent utilities and maintenance information technology administrative costs related to our home office, district and regional operations credit/debit card fees real, personal property and other taxes (excluding income taxes) ($ in millions) 2010 2009 SG&A $ 5,350 $ 5,382 As a percent of sales 30.1 % 30.7 % SG&A expenses declined $32 million to $5,350 million in 2010 compared to $5,382 million in 2009. As a percent of sales, SG&A expenses were leveraged and decreased 60 basis points to 30.1% compared to 30.7% in 2009. A lower incentive compensation accrual for 2010 offset higher store salary costs that were impacted by the minimum wage increase and the resumption of merit increases, as well as the higher salaries associated with the additional Sephora inside jcpenney locations, which are more labor intensive than other departments in the store. The lower incentive compensation accrual was primarily the result of not achieving our sales plan as the discontinuation of the catalog business had a greater impact on sales than expected. In addition, last years accrual included a special one time recognition bonus program for mostly store based hourly associates. Risk insurance expense, as well as health and welfare plan costs were also lower in the year. Risk insurance expense declined as a result of our workers compensation initiatives and favorable industry trends and health and welfare costs were lower as a result of a decline in participation levels. While our year over year marketing expense was relatively flat with last year, spending was reallocated from catalog and print media to local and national advertising and online media. Pension Expense ($ in millions) 2010 2009 Primary pension plan expense $ 221 $ 298 Supplemental pension plans expense 34 39 Total pension expense $ 255 $ 337 22 Table of Contents Total pension expense was $255 million in 2010 compared to $337 million in 2009 and consisted mainly of the primary pension plan expense of $221 million in 2010 versus $298 million for 2009. The 2010 primary pension plan expense declined mainly as a result of higher returns on our pension plan assets as of the 2009 year end measurement date due to positive market returns in 2009 combined with our May 2009 discretionary contribution of common stock to the plan. Based on our 2010 year end measurement of primary pension plan assets and benefit obligations, we expect our 2011 non cash primary pension plan expense to decline to $87 million compared to $221 million in 2010. The lower expense will benefit EPS about $0.35 based on the 2010 level of shares used for the EPS calculation. The reduction is primarily the result of positive returns on plan assets due to favorable capital market experience in 2010 and our discretionary cash contribution of $392 million in May 2010, partially offset by a 90 basis point decline in our expected return on plan assets. The decline of the expected rate of return is due to our new target allocation strategy to mitigate volatility risk by decreasing the plans asset allocation to equities and shifting to less volatile fixed income investments. For more information, see Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. Depreciation and Amortization Expenses Depreciation and amortization expenses in 2010 increased $16 million to $511 million, or approximately 3.2%, compared to $495 million in 2009 primarily as a result of our store renewals and updates over the past two years. Pre Opening Expense Pre opening expense, which includes advertising, hiring and training costs for new associates, processing and stocking initial merchandise inventory and rental costs prior to store opening and similar costs prior to a new Sephora inside jcpenney location opening, was $8 million for 2010 compared to $28 million in 2009. In 2010, we opened two new stores and 76 Sephora inside jcpenney locations compared to 17 new stores and 64 Sephora inside jcpenney locations in 2009. Real Estate and Other, Net ($ in millions) 2010 2009 Real estate activities $ (34 ) $ (34 ) Net gains from sale of real estate (8 ) (2 ) Impairments 3 42 Restructuring charges 32 Other 11 (1 ) Total expense $ 4 $ 5 Real estate and other consists of ongoing operating income from our real estate subsidiaries, net gains from the sale of facilities and equipment that are no longer used in our operations, other non operating corporate charges and credits, as well as asset impairments and restructuring related charges. Real estate and other expenses totaled $4 million in 2010 compared to $5 million in 2009. While operating income from our real estate activities was consistent year over year at $34 million, net gains from sale of real estate were $6 million higher in 2010 from the sale of two properties. In 2010, impairments totaled $3 million and related primarily to one underperforming store that continues to operate. In 2009, impairments totaled $42 million and related to seven underperforming department 23 Table of Contents stores and other corporate assets. Real estate and other in 2010 also included $32 million of initial restructuring charges related primarily to the wind down of our catalog and outlet operations and streamlining the related call center operations and facility consolidation within our custom decorating business. Other expenses of $11 million in 2010 included legal and other advisory costs related to the Companys evaluation of capital restructuring alternatives. Operating Income Operating income increased 90 basis points to 4.7% of sales in 2010 compared to 3.8% last year. Excluding the non cash impact of the primary pension plan, adjusted operating income (non GAAP) increased 40 basis points to 5.9% of sales compared to 5.5% in 2009. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense consists principally of interest expense on long term debt, net of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents. Net interest expense was $231 million, a decrease of $29 million, or 11.2%, from $260 million in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to lower debt levels combined with lower interest rate levels resulting from long term debt transactions completed during the year. Bond Premiums and Unamortized Costs In 2010, we incurred $20 million of additional financing costs, consisting primarily of bond premiums paid in connection with the debt tender offer completed in May 2010. There were no comparable costs in 2009. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate for continuing operations for 2010 was 34.9% compared with 38.2% for 2009. The tax rate decreased due to favorable resolution of certain state income tax audits combined with changes in state tax laws and an increase in our federal wage tax credit. Income from Continuing Operations Income from continuing operations for 2010 increased 51.8% to $378 million, or $1.59 per share, compared with $249 million, or $1.07 per share, last year. Excluding the non cash impact of the primary pension plan, adjusted income from continuing operations (non GAAP) increased 18.5% to $513 million, or $2.16 per share, compared to $433 million, or $1.86 per share, for 2009. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations in 2010 generated a credit of $11 million, net of $4 million of income tax expense, or $0.04 per share, compared to a credit of $2 million, net of $1 million of income tax expense, or $0.01 per share, in 2009, and primarily reflected a reduction in the environmental reserve we retained when we sold our drugstore business. The reduction to the reserve was due in part to the affirmation of an additional responsible party to one of the known sites involving a warehouse facility, as well as an update for actual historical experience. These previously discontinued operations are no longer expected to have a future material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Other Significant Events in 2010 Effective October 29, 2010, we amended our agreement with GE Money Bank (GEMB) governing our private label credit card program (the Program). The amendment provides for certain changes to the 24 Table of Contents Program to offset the financial impacts to GEMB from recent changes in law. To mitigate the expected revenue impacts resulting from the issuance of new regulations by the Federal Reserve under the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, we agreed to eliminate the annual signing bonus payable to us, effective July 1, 2010, as well as an application bounty payment, also payable to us, and agreed to modify the gain share calculation. The amendment also permits GEMB to make certain changes to credit terms on cardholder accounts, including finance charges, late fees and minimum payments. In addition, the amendment entitles GEMB to offer a debt protection product to new and existing cardholders. 2009 Compared to 2008 Total Net Sales 2009 2008 Total net sales (in millions) $ 17,556 $ 18,486 Sales percent (decrease) Total net sales (5.0 )% (6.9 )% Comparable store sales (6.3 )% (8.5 )% Sales per gross square foot(1) $ 149 $ 160 (1) Calculation includes the sales of stores that were open for the full fiscal year, as well as online sales through jcp.com. Total net sales declined $930 million in 2009 compared to 2008. The following table provides the components of the net sales decline: ($ in millions) 2009 Comparable store sales decline $ (1,085 ) Sales of new stores 342 Sales of closed stores (34 ) Sales decline through catalog print media and outlet stores (153 ) 2009 total net sales decline $ (930 ) In 2009, comparable store sales decreased 6.3% as a result of continued weak consumer spending combined with our strategy to reduce clearance selling and unprofitable discounting by choosing not to anniversary promotions that negatively impacted operating profit. Sales of non comparable stores opened in 2009 and 2008, net of closings, added $308 million. In 2009, we opened 15 net new stores (17 stores, net of 2 closings and relocations) and in 2008, we opened 26 net new stores (35 stores, net of 9 closings and relocations). As expected, catalog print media and outlet store sales declined in the year and reflected the continued shift in sales from print media to jcp.com. All components combined, total net sales declined 5.0% in 2009, with approximately half of the decrease attributable to lower sales of clearance merchandise. Our mall store traffic was down for 2009 but exceeded overall mall traffic trends. Our off mall store traffic was also down compared to 2008 but had stronger traffic trends than our mall stores. While our average unit retail increased slightly as a result of more merchandise sold at regular promotional prices, the number of transactions and the number of units sold declined as inventory levels were tightly managed in the difficult economic climate. 25 Table of Contents Geographically, the southwest and central regions were the best performing regions for 2009, while the southeast and northwest regions were the weakest performing. Sales for jcp.com increased 3.4% in the fourth quarter and ended 2009 with approximately $1.5 billion of sales, essentially flat with 2008. While sales in all merchandise categories declined versus last year, our best performing categories were shoes, particularly athletic footwear, and womens apparel. Fine jewelry and home experienced the weakest performance for the year. Private and exclusive brands found only at jcpenney as a percent of total merchandise sales were 54% in 2009 and 52% in 2008. Total Net Sales Mix The following percentages represent the mix of total net sales: 2009 2008 Womens apparel 24 % 24 % Home 19 % 20 % Mens apparel and accessories 19 % 19 % Childrens apparel 11 % 11 % Womens accessories, including Sephora 11 % 10 % Family footwear 7 % 6 % Fine jewelry 4 % 5 % Services and other 5 % 5 % 100 % 100 % In 2009, we opened 64 Sephora inside jcpenney locations, which brought the total to 155 locations compared to 91 at the end of 2008. Gross Margin ($ in millions) 2009 2008 Gross margin $ 6,910 $ 6,915 As a percent of sales 39.4 % 37.4 % Gross margin increased 200 basis points to 39.4% of sales in 2009 and exceeded our previous historical high annual gross margin rate of 39.3% achieved in 2006. On a dollar basis, gross margin declined only $5 million, or 0.1%, to $6,910 million, despite the $930 million, or 5.0%, decline in total net sales for the year. The gross margin rate improved significantly as we effectively controlled inventory and planned for lower sales levels with reductions in both clearance selling and unprofitable discounting. In addition, sourcing costs were slightly lower for the year. Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses ($ in millions) 2009 2008 SG&A $ 5,382 $ 5,395 As a percent of sales 30.7 % 29.2 % SG&A expenses declined $13 million to $5,382 million compared to $5,395 million in 2008. However, due to lower sales in 2009, SG&A expenses were not leveraged and increased 150 basis points to 30.7% as a percent of sales compared to 29.2% in 2008. Marketing costs declined compared to the prior year, as we realigned advertising resources to better leverage media to reach our customers, 26 Table of Contents which led to discontinuing certain unprofitable promotions and reducing catalog book costs as planned by reducing total page count and books circulated. SG&A expenses also benefited in 2009 from the $11 million distribution of the Visa Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litigation settlement. Offsetting the decline in expenses were higher incentive compensation accruals covering approximately 7,500 associates due to better than planned sales and operating income, as well as a special recognition bonus program for over 100,000 mostly store based hourly associates. Additionally, other store expenses, including salaries, facility management and occupancy costs were well managed throughout the organization despite approximately $115 million of incremental costs associated with non comparable stores. Pension Expense/(Income) ($ in millions) 2009 2008 Primary pension plan expense/(income) $ 298 $ (133 ) Supplemental pension plans expense 39 43 Total pension expense/(income) $ 337 $ (90 ) Total pension expense was $337 million in 2009 compared to income of $90 million in 2008, and consisted mainly of the primary pension plan expense of $298 million in 2009 versus primary pension plan income of $133 million, resulting in a negative swing of $431 million, or $1.16 per share on an after tax basis. The expense is primarily the result of the amortization of the primary pension plans unrealized losses due to the significant decline in plan assets in 2008. On May 18, 2009, we voluntarily contributed Company common stock valued at $340 million to our primary pension plan. Along with the contribution and to reflect updated pension assumptions relating to the pension liability, we remeasured the plans assets and obligations as of the date of the contribution. Based on the new measurement, the net periodic pension plan expense for 2009 was reduced by $24 million to $298 million from the original estimate of $322 million. Depreciation and Amortization Expenses Depreciation and amortization expenses in 2009 increased $26 million to $495 million, or approximately 5.5%, compared to $469 million in 2008, primarily due to the addition of new stores and investments in renovating existing stores. Pre Opening Expense Pre opening expense was $28 million for 2009 compared to $31 million in 2008. We opened 17 new stores and 64 Sephora inside jcpenney locations in 2009 compared to 35 new stores and 44 Sephora inside jcpenney locations in 2008. Relative to the number of stores opened, the pre opening expenses for 2009 were significantly higher than 2008 primarily due to the recognition of rent expense (level rent) during the construction period associated with our Manhattan store in New York City, which opened in late July 2009. Real Estate and Other, Net ($ in millions) 2009 2008 Real estate activities $ (34) $ (39) Net gains from sale of real estate (2) (10) Impairments and other 41 24 Total expense/(income) $ 5 $ (25) 27 Table of Contents Real estate and other was a net charge of $5 million in 2009 versus income of $25 million in 2008, declining $30 million primarily as a result of higher impairment charges and lower net gains from the sale of real estate in 2009. Impairments in 2009 totaled $42 million and included seven underperforming department stores and other corporate assets. Impairments were $21 million in 2008, primarily related to a department store, a real estate joint venture and other corporate assets. Operating Income Operating income declined 230 basis points to 3.8% of sales in 2009 compared to 6.1% in 2008. Excluding the non cash impact of the primary pension plan, adjusted operating income (non GAAP) increased 10 basis points to 5.5% of sales compared to 5.4% in 2008. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense was $260 million in 2009, an increase of $35 million, or 15.6%, from $225 million in 2008. The increase in net interest expense was due primarily to a significant decline in the weighted average annual interest rate earned on short term investment balances to 0.1% in 2009 from 1.6% in 2008. Interest income on short term investments was $3 million in 2009 compared to $32 million in 2008. Net interest expense for 2009 also reflected higher credit line fees related to our new Credit Facility, offset by lower long term interest expense due to lower average long term debt as a result of our debt repayment in mid 2008 and repurchases of debt in 2009. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate for continuing operations for 2009 was 38.2% compared with 37.7% for 2008. The tax rate increase was due to the lower level of pre tax income as well as state audit activity and state income tax legislative changes enacted during the year. Income from Continuing Operations Income from continuing operations for 2009 declined 56.1% to $249 million, or $1.07 per share, compared with $567 million, or $2.54 per share, in 2008. Excluding the non cash impact of the primary pension plan, adjusted income from continuing operations (non GAAP) decreased 10.5% to $433 million, or $1.86 per share, compared to $484 million, or $2.17 per share, for 2008. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations in 2009 generated a credit of $2 million, net of $1 million of income tax expense, or $0.01 per share, compared to a credit of $5 million, or $0.03 per share, in 2008, and was primarily the result of our ongoing review and true up of reserves related to previously discontinued operations. 28 Table of Contents Financial Condition and Liquidity Overview In 2010, we continued to have a strong balance sheet and liquidity position. The cornerstone of our strength is our cash and cash equivalent balances and our ability to generate positive free cash flow (non GAAP). For 2010, we ended the year with $2.6 billion of cash and cash equivalent balances and had positive free cash flow of $158 million. Our liquidity position provides the flexibility for our team to support the key components of our growth initiatives. Early in 2010, we used cash on hand to retire $393 million of debt at its maturity and $300 million to purchase long term debt through a tender offer. At year end 2010, our cash to debt ratio was about 85%, while our debt to total capital ratio improved to 36%. Our next scheduled debt maturity of $230 million will occur in August 2012. In addition to cash flow and cash and cash equivalent balances, which are sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, our existing credit facility provides an additional $750 million source of liquidity. Other than the issuance of trade and standby letters of credit, which totaled $172 million at year end 2010, we have not utilized this facility nor do we expect to do so in 2011. The following table provides a summary of our key components and ratios of financial condition and liquidity: ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,622 $ 3,011 $ 2,352 Merchandise inventory 3,213 3,024 3,259 Property and equipment, net 5,231 5,357 5,367 Long term debt, including current maturities $ 3,099 $ 3,392 $ 3,505 Stockholders equity 5,460 4,778 4,155 Total capital $ 8,559 $ 8,170 $ 7,660 Additional amounts available under our credit agreements $ 750 $ 750 $ 1,200 Cash flow from operating activities 592 1,573 (1) 1,156 Free cash flow (non GAAP)(2) 158 677 22 Capital expenditures 499 600 969 Dividends paid 189 183 178 Ratios and measures: Debt to total capital(3) 36.2 % 41.5 % 45.8 % Cash to debt(4) 84.6 % 88.8 % 67.1 % (1) Included a $126 million tax benefit as a result of the contribution of common stock to the primary pension plan. (2) See Item 6, Selected Financial Data, for a discussion of this non GAAP financial measure and reconciliation to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. (3) Long term debt, including current maturities divided by total capital. (4) Cash and cash equivalents divided by long term debt, including current maturities. Cash and Cash Equivalents At year end 2010, we had $2.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents, which represented approximately 85% of our $3.1 billion of outstanding long term debt. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $389 million in 2010 after cash uses that included $693 million to reduce long term debt through payments at maturity and a debt tender offer. In addition, we issued $400 million of new debt and used the net 29 Table of Contents proceeds of approximately $392 million to make a discretionary contribution to our primary pension plan. Our cash investments are held in U.S. Treasury money market funds and a portfolio of highly rated bank deposits. In addition to cash and cash equivalents, our liquidity position includes a $750 million revolving credit facility (Credit Agreement). As of January 29, 2011, we had no current maturities of debt. However, our 2010 and 2007 debt issuances contain a change of control provision that would obligate us, at the holders option, to repurchase the debt at a price of 101%. These provisions trigger if there were a beneficial ownership change of 50% or more of our common stock and, for the 2010 issuance, if the debt was downgraded from current levels and, for the 2007 issuances, if the debt was rated non investment grade. This provision applies to $1.1 billion of our debt. Free Cash Flow (non GAAP) Free cash flow (non GAAP) is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, excluding discretionary cash contributions to our primary pension plan and any associated cash tax impacts, less capital expenditures and dividends paid, plus proceeds from the sale of assets. Our 2010 free cash flow was $158 million compared to $677 million in 2009. The decrease was mainly due to higher receipts of merchandise inventory and higher payments of incentive compensation that was accrued in 2009, partially offset by a reduction in capital expenditures. Operating Activities Our operations are seasonal in nature, with the business depending to a great extent on the last quarter of the year when a significant portion of the sales, profits and positive operating cash flows are realized. Cash requirements are highest in the third quarter as we build inventory levels in preparation for the holiday season. During 2010, our peak cash requirements increased as planned as we increased merchandise receipts. 2010 cash flow from operating activities was $592 million, a decrease of about $1 billion from the prior year. The decrease was primarily attributable to higher receipts of merchandise inventory, the $392 million discretionary pension contribution, and higher payments of incentive compensation, partially offset by lower income taxes paid. Total inventory was $3,213 million at the end of 2010, an increase of 6.3% from 2009, but about flat with the 2008 level. We approached 2009 conservatively and planned lower levels due to the uncertain economic environment. In response to the recovering environment and supported by our financial flexibility, we maintained a higher level of merchandise inventory in 2010. We believe that the inventory level at the end of 2010 is appropriate to support our 2011 sales growth plan, including the expansion of Liz Claiborne into additional categories and the rollout of additional Sephora inside jcpenney and MNG by Mango to additional store locations. Inventory turns for 2010, 2009 and 2008 were 3.05, 3.15 and 3.06, respectively. 2009 cash flow from operating activities was $1,573 million, an increase of $417 million as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily attributable to lower merchandise inventory receipts and lower payments of incentive compensation and income taxes than in 2008. 30 Table of Contents Investing Activities ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net cash (used)/provided by: Capital expenditures $ (499 ) $ (600 ) $ (969 ) Proceeds from sale of assets 14 13 13 Investing activities $ (485 ) $ (587 ) $ (956 ) In 2010, we invested $499 million in capital expenditures for two new stores, 26 major renovations, 76 new Sephora inside jcpenney locations, 15 store refurbishments, fixture and store environment improvements in over 500 stores and our digital initiatives. In 2009, we invested $600 million in capital expenditures for 17 new stores, 16 in our off mall format, and our store in Manhattan, 64 new Sephora inside jcpenney locations, 20 major capital improvements, 22 store refurbishments, fixture and store environment improvements in over 500 stores and technology. In 2008, we invested $969 million in capital expenditures for 35 new or relocated stores, 31 of which were in our off mall format, 44 new Sephora inside jcpenney locations, 24 major renovations, fixture and store environment improvements in about 600 stores and 90 store refurbishments. The following provides a breakdown of capital expenditures: ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Store renewals and updates $ 257 $ 195 $ 322 Capitalized software 100 72 66 New and relocated stores 25 163 460 Technology and other 117 (1) 170 (2) 121 Total $ 499 $ 600 $ 969 (1) Included $27 million for the repurchase of eight stores that were originally part of sale leaseback transactions, of which we have 14 remaining sale leaseback transactions. (2) Included $31 million for the repurchase of 12 stores that were originally part of sale leaseback transactions. We expect to invest approximately $650 million in capital expenditures in 2011 that will be funded with cash flow from operations and existing cash and cash equivalent balances. Financing Activities ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net cash provided by/(used) in: Proceeds from issuance of long term debt $ 392 $ $ Payments of long term debt, including financing costs (707 ) (145 ) (203 ) Dividends paid (189 ) (183 ) (178 ) Other 8 1 1 Total $ (496 ) $ (327 ) $ (380 ) 31 Table of Contents In 2010, we completed several financing transactions. On March 1, 2010, we repaid at maturity $393 million principal amount of 8.0% Notes due 2010. In May, we paid aggregate consideration of $314 million, including accrued but unpaid interest, to purchase $300 million principal amount of JCPs outstanding 6.375% Senior Notes due 2036, which were validly tendered pursuant to a cash tender offer. Also in May, we closed on our offering of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 5.65% Senior Notes due 2020 and used proceeds of the offering, net of discounts, of $392 million to make a voluntary cash contribution to the J. C. Penney Corporation, Inc. Pension Plan. In 2010, we maintained our quarterly dividend on common stock at $0.20 per share and returned $189 million to stockholders through dividend payments. The Board reviews the dividend policy and rate, taking into consideration our overall financial and strategic outlook, earnings, liquidity and cash flow projections, as well as competitive factors. The Board approves and declares dividends on a quarterly basis. In 2009, pursuant to a cash tender offer, we accepted for purchase $104 million principal amount of the 8% Notes due March 1, 2010 and purchased another $9 million of these notes in the open market. There were no issuances of new debt during 2009. We paid financing costs of $32 million, which consisted of Credit Facility fees and premiums on early retirement of debt from our cash tender offer. During 2009, we returned $183 million to stockholders through dividend payments. During 2008, cash payments on long term debt totaled $203 million and consisted primarily of the August 2008 payment at maturity of $200 million outstanding principal amount of JCPs 7.375% Notes Due 2008. During 2008, we returned $178 million to stockholders through dividend payments. Cash Flow and Financing Outlook In 2011, our financing strategy will continue to focus on opportunities to maintain and further strengthen our financial position, improve our credit profile and deliver value to stockholders. Our strong financial position provides continued financial flexibility and enables us to strengthen our competitive and financial position as the environment continues to improve. Consistent with our financing strategy, in February the Board approved a program to purchase up to $900 million of common stock in open market transactions and a plan to renew our revolving credit facility early in 2011, ahead of its maturity in 2012. In addition, our operating and capital expenditure plans have been adjusted to reflect current operating conditions, while continuing to reinvest capital into the business. Capital expenditures are planned at $650 million for the year, which includes investments in important planning and allocation tools, such as size and markdown optimization, our digital initiatives, the expansion of MNG by Mango and Call It Spring, three new department stores, 69 renovations, 76 new Sephora inside jcpenney locations and fixture and store environment improvements in over 500 stores. We have no debt maturities until August 2012. We do not expect to borrow under our credit facility except to support ongoing letters of credit. We will fund our capital expenditures and the $900 million share repurchase program with operating cash flows in 2011, as well as the cash investment balances available at the beginning of the year. In accordance with our long term financing strategy, we manage our financial position on a multi year basis and may access the capital markets opportunistically. 32 Table of Contents Credit Facility In 2009, the Company, JCP and J. C. Penney Purchasing Corporation entered into a three year, $750 million revolving credit agreement (Credit Facility) with a syndicate of lenders with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. The facility may be used for general corporate purposes and the issuance of letters of credit. The Credit Facility is secured by our merchandise inventory, which security interest can be released upon attainment of certain credit rating levels. Pricing under the Credit Facility is tiered based on JCPs senior unsecured long term credit ratings issued by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poors Ratings Services. JCPs obligations under the 2009 Credit Facility are guaranteed by J. C. Penney Company, Inc. As of January 29, 2011, we were in compliance with the required financial covenants under the Credit Facility. As of such date, our leverage ratio was 2 to 1, not exceeding the 3 to 1 maximum requirement; our fixed charge coverage ratio was 3.8 to 1, exceeding the required minimum of 2.5 to 1; and our asset coverage ratio was 19 to 1, exceeding the required minimum of 3 to 1. In 2011, we do not expect to borrow under our Credit Facility other than to provide support for the issuance of letters of credit, which totaled $172 million at the end of 2010. While the Credit Facility matures in 2012, the Board approved a plan in February to renegotiate a new revolving credit facility in early 2011. Credit Ratings Our credit ratings were affirmed on February 28, 2011, following the announcement of our planned buyback of $900 million of common stock. Long TermDebt Outlook Moodys Investors Service, Inc. Ba1 Stable Standard & Poors Ratings Services BB+ Stable Fitch Ratings BBB Stable Rating agencies consider changes in operating performance, comparable store sales, the economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, financial leverage and changes in our business strategy in their rating decisions. 33 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Commitments Aggregated information about our obligations and commitments to make future contractual payments, such as debt and lease agreements, and contingent commitments as of January 29, 2011 is presented in the following table.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Management considers all on and off balance sheet debt in evaluating our overall liquidity position and capital structure. Other than operating leases, which are included in the Contractual Obligations and Commitments table, we do not have any material off balance sheet financing. See detailed disclosure regarding operating leases and their off balance sheet present value in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. 34 Table of Contents We do not have any additional arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements. Common Stock The number of outstanding shares of common stock was 237 million at the end of 2010, 236 million at the end of 2009 and 222 million at the end of 2008. The increase in 2009 was primarily the result of our contribution of approximately 13 million shares of common stock to our primary pension plan. Inflation Inflation has not significantly impacted our results of operations over the past three years. While the retail industry expects inflationary cost increases in 2011, particularly in the later part of the year, we have programs in place to mitigate the effects of inflation that include adjusting our product mix, leveraging our sourcing capabilities, and where appropriate, based on price elasticity studies, increasing prices. Our direct sourcing operation enables us to leverage our more than 50 years of relationships with major overseas suppliers, which allows us to source merchandise more cost effectively. 35 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that we make estimates and use assumptions that in some instances may materially affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments based on history and current trends, as well as other factors that we believe are relevant at the time of the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Historically, actual results have not differed materially from estimates; however, future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty and as a result, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates. We have discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to these policies in this MD&A. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of all of our significant accounting policies. Inventory Valuation under the Retail Method Inventories are valued primarily at the lower of cost (using the first in, first out or FIFO method) or market, determined by the retail method for department stores, store distribution centers and regional warehouses and standard cost, representing average vendor cost, for merchandise we sell through the Internet at jcp.com. Under the retail method, retail values are converted to a cost basis by applying specific average cost factors to groupings of merchandise. The retail method inherently requires management judgment and certain estimates that may significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost, as well as gross margin. Two of the most significant estimates are permanent reductions to retail prices (markdowns) used to clear unproductive or slow moving inventory and inventory shortages (shrinkage). Permanent markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded at the point of decision, when the utility of inventory has diminished, versus the point of sale. Factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand, customer preferences, age of the merchandise and style trends. The corresponding reduction to gross margin is recorded in the period the decision is made. Shrinkage is estimated as a percent of sales for the period from the last physical inventory date to the end of the fiscal period. Physical inventories are taken at least annually and inventory records are adjusted accordingly. The shrinkage rate from the most recent physical inventory, in combination with current events and historical experience, is used as the standard for the shrinkage accrual rate for the next inventory cycle. Historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable. Based on prior experience, we do not believe that the actual results will differ significantly from the assumptions used in these estimates. A 10% increase or decrease in the permanent markdowns reflected in our inventory as of the end of the year would have impacted net income by approximately $14 million. A 10% increase or decrease in the estimated inventory shrinkage accrued as of the end of the year would have impacted net income by approximately $4 million. 36 Table of Contents Valuation of Long Lived Assets We evaluate recoverability of long lived assets, such as property and equipment, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, such as historical operating losses or plans to close stores and dispose of or sell long lived assets before the end of their previously estimated useful lives. Additionally, for store assets, in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, we separately test the performance of individual stores, and underperforming stores are selected for further evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying amounts. If the evaluation, performed on an undiscounted cash flow basis, indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, the potential impairment is measured as the excess of carrying value over the fair value of the impaired asset. The impairment calculation requires us to apply estimates for future cash flows and use judgments for qualitative factors such as local market conditions, operating environment, mall performance and other trends. We estimate fair value based on either a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate that is considered commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model or appraised value, as appropriate. We recognize an impairment loss in the period in which it occurs. The carrying value is adjusted to the new carrying value and any subsequent increases in fair value are not recorded. If it is determined that the estimated remaining useful life of the asset should be decreased, the periodic depreciation expense is adjusted based on the new carrying value of the asset. Impairment losses totaling $3 million, $42 million and $21 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, were recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in the real estate and other, net line item. The $3 million charge for 2010 is primarily for one store that continues to operate. While we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate long lived asset impairments, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may be exposed to additional impairment charges. Reserves and Valuation Allowances We are primarily self insured for costs related to workers compensation and general liability claims. The liabilities represent our best estimate, using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods through which we record a provision for workers compensation and general liability risk based on historical experience, current claims data and independent actuarial best estimates, including incurred but not reported claims and projected loss development factors. These estimates are subject to the frequency, lag and severity of claims. We target this provision above the midpoint of the actuarial range, and total estimated claim liability amounts are discounted using a risk free rate. We do not anticipate any significant change in loss trends, settlements or other costs that would cause a significant fluctuation in net income. However, a 10% variance in the workers compensation and general liability reserves at year end 2010 would have affected net income by approximately $15 million. Income taxes are estimated for each jurisdiction in which we operate and require significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. This involves assessing the current tax exposure together with temporary differences, which result from differing treatment of items for tax and book purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are provided for based on these assessments. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for recoverability based on estimated future taxable income. To the extent that recovery is deemed unlikely, a valuation allowance is recorded. We record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, in an income tax return. We recognize any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Significant judgment is required in assessing, among other things, the timing and 37 Table of Contents amounts of deductible and taxable items. In assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets, we use estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income. Tax contingency accruals are evaluated and adjusted as appropriate, while taking into account the progress of audits of various taxing jurisdictions. We do not expect the outcome of tax audits to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. Many years of data have been incorporated into the determination of tax reserves, and our estimates have historically been reasonable. In establishing our reserves for liabilities associated with underground storage tanks, we maintain and periodically update an inventory listing of potentially impacted sites. The estimated cost of remediation efforts is based on our historical experience, as well as industry and other published data. With respect to our former drugstore operations, we accessed extensive databases of environmental matters, including data from the Environmental Protection Agency, to estimate the cost of remediation. Our experience, as well as relevant data, was used to develop a range of potential liabilities, and a reserve was established at the time of the sale of our drugstore business. The reserve is adjusted as payments are made or new information becomes known. In 2010, we lowered the reserve due to the affirmation of another responsible party to one of the known sites involving a warehouse facility and review of our actual experience over the past several years. Reserves for asbestos removal are based on our known liabilities in connection with approved plans for store modernization, renovations or dispositions of store locations. We believe the established reserves, as adjusted, are adequate to cover estimated potential liabilities. Pension Pension Accounting We maintain a qualified funded defined benefit pension plan (primary plan) and smaller non qualified unfunded supplemental defined benefit plans. The determination of pension expense is the result of actuarial calculations that are based on important assumptions about pension assets and liabilities. The most important of these are the rate of return on assets and the discount rate assumptions. These assumptions require significant judgment and a change in any one of them could have a material impact on pension expense reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, as well as in the assets, liability and equity sections of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following table reflects our rate of return and discount rate assumptions: 2010 2009 2008 Expected return on plan assets 8.4 % 8.4 % 8.9 % Discount rate for pension expense 5.90 % 6.86 %(1) 6.54 % Discount rate for pension obligation 5.65 % 5.90 % 6.95 % (1) For the first four months of 2009, the discount rate was 6.95% as determined by the January 31, 2009 annual measurement. The discount rate was revised to 6.86% on the remeasurement date of May 18, 2009. The supplemental plans and retiree medical plans used 6.95% for the year, since those plans were not subject to remeasurement. Return on Plan Assets and Impact on Earnings For the primary plan, we apply our expected return on plan assets using fair market value as of the annual measurement date. The fair market value method results in greater volatility to our pension 38 Table of Contents expense than the more commonly used calculated value method (referred to as smoothing of assets). Our primary plan asset base is well diversified with an asset allocation mix of equities (U.S., non U.S. and private), fixed income (investment grade and high yield) and real estate (private and public). As of January 1, 2007, the primary plan was closed to new entrants. As a result of this action, the future growth of the plan liability is expected to moderate and ultimately begin to decline. In recognition of the changing liability characteristics and to provide a more desirable balance of investment return and volatility risk, we intend to shift 15% of the plans allocation from equities to fixed income over the next three years depending on market conditions and plan characteristics. The shift to a higher mix of fixed income investments will provide a better match to the plans changing liability characteristics. As a result of the planned assets allocation shift, our expected return on plan assets for 2011 was reduced to 7.5%. In 2010 and 2009, the expected return on plan assets was 8.4%, which was reduced from the 2008 rate of 8.9% as a result of the negative returns in the capital markets and lowered expected future returns. Discount Rate The discount rate assumption used to determine our postretirement obligations was based on an externally published yield curve determined by the plans actuary. The yield curve is a hypothetical AA yield curve represented by a series of bonds maturing from six months to 30 years, designed to match the corresponding pension benefit cash payments to retirees. Each underlying bond issue is required to have a rating of Aa2 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or a rating of AA or better by Standard & Poors Ratings Services. For 2010, the discount rate to measure pension expense was 5.90%. For 2009, the discount rate initially increased to 6.95% from 6.54% as of January 31, 2009 and then slightly decreased to 6.86% from 6.95% for the May 18, 2009 remeasurement, which had an overall small positive impact on 2009 pension expense. The discount rate was adjusted in May 2009 for the remeasurement of plan assets and obligations to reflect the voluntary contribution of 13.4 million shares of Company common stock and update other pension liability assumptions. The discount rate to measure pension obligation declined to 5.65% as of January 29, 2011 from 5.90% as of January 31, 2010. Sensitivity The sensitivity of the pension expense to a plus or minus one half of one percent of expected return on assets is a decrease or increase in expense of approximately $0.05 per share. An increase or decrease in the discount rate of one half of one percent would decrease or increase the expense by approximately $0.10 per share. Pension Funding Funding requirements for our primary plan are determined under Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) rules, as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. As a result of the strong funded status of the primary plan, we are not required to make cash contributions in 2011 or 2012. Our funding policy is to maintain a well funded pension plan throughout all business and economic cycles. Maintaining a well funded plan over time provides additional financial flexibility, which includes lower pension expense and reduced cash contributions, especially in the event of a decline in 39 Table of Contents the capital markets. In addition, a well funded plan assures associates of the plans and our financial ability to continue to provide competitive retirement benefits, while at the same time being cost effective. Consistent with our funding policy, on May 24, 2010, we used net proceeds of approximately $392 million from the issuance of $400 million of 5.65% Senior Notes due 2020 to make a voluntary cash contribution to the primary plan. In 2009, we voluntarily contributed approximately 13.4 million newly issued shares of Company common stock to the primary plan. The contribution was valued at $340 million, based on a price of $25.39 per share, reflecting a 6.5% discount to the closing price of Company common stock on May 18, 2009.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information This Annual Report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements made within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which reflect our current view of future events and financial performance. The words expect, plan, anticipate, believe, intend, should, will and similar expressions identify forward looking statements. Any such forward looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to be materially different from planned or expected results. Those risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions, including inflation, recession, unemployment levels, consumer spending patterns, credit availability and debt levels, changes in store traffic trends, the cost of goods, trade restrictions, changes in tariff, freight and shipping rates, changes in the cost of fuel and other energy and transportation costs, increases in wage and benefit costs, competition and retail industry consolidations, interest rate fluctuations, dollar and other currency valuations, risks associated with war, an act of terrorism or pandemic, and a systems failure and or security breach that results in the theft, transfer or unauthorized disclosure of customer, employee or Company information.

While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is impossible to predict the degree to which any such factors could cause actual results to differ materially from predicted results. For additional discussion on risks and uncertainties, see Item 1A, Risk Factors. We intend the forward looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K to speak only as of the date of this report and do not undertake to update or revise these projections as more information becomes available. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. We maintain a majority of our cash and cash equivalents in financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less. Such investments are subject to interest rate risk and may have a small decline in value if interest rates increase. Since the financial instruments are of short duration, a change of 100 basis points in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial condition. All of our outstanding long term debt as of January 29, 2011 is at fixed interest rates and would not be affected by interest rate changes. Future borrowings under our multi year revolving credit facility, to the extent that fluctuating rate loans were used, would be affected by interest rate changes. As of 40 Table of Contents January 29, 2011, no borrowings were outstanding under the facility other than the issuance of trade and standby letters of credit, which totaled $172 million. We do not believe that a change of 100 basis points in interest rates would have a material effect on our financial condition. The fair value of long term debt is estimated by obtaining quotes from brokers or is based on current rates offered for similar debt. At January 29, 2011 long term debt had a carrying value and fair value of $3.1 billion. At January 30, 2010, long term debt, including current maturities, had a carrying value of $3.4 billion and a fair value of $3.3 billion. The effects of changes in the U.S. equity and bond markets serve to increase or decrease the value of assets in our primary pension plan. We seek to manage exposure to adverse equity and bond returns by maintaining diversified investment portfolios and utilizing professional investment managers.
