Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion, which presents our results, should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, along with the Five Year Financial and Operations Summaries, the risk factors and the cautionary statement regarding forward looking information. Unless otherwise indicated, this Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) relates only to results from continuing operations, all references to (loss)/earnings per share (EPS) are on a diluted basis and all references to years relate to fiscal years rather than to calendar years. Financial Reporting For this Annual Report on Form 10 K, we modified our financial reporting disclosures as follows: We early adopted Accounting Standards Update 2011 05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income by providing a separate Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. We updated our non GAAP measures for adjusted operating income and adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations to exclude restructuring and management transition charges. Unlike normal recurring operating expenses, restructuring and management transition charges are unrelated to our ongoing core business operations. We relocated our merchandise mix of total net sales to Item 1, Business. Shares for weighted average shares outstanding for both basic and diluted EPS have been included directly on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Executive Overview Our comparable store sales were essentially flat at 0.2% for the year. Total sales decreased 2.8%, reflecting our exit from the catalog and catalog outlet businesses. The gross margin rate as a percent of sales decreased to 36.0%, compared to last years 39.2%, due to the softer than expected selling environment and the resulting increased promotional activity and the costs associated with implementing our new pricing strategy. From an expense standpoint, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were leveraged against sales despite the total sales decline. Including restructuring and management transition charges, our loss from continuing operations was $152 million, or $0.70 per share, for 2011 compared to income from continuing operations of $378 million, or $1.59 per share, last year. Restructuring and management transition charges were $451 million, or $1.41 per share. Other key information for 2011 was as follows: In May 2011, we completed our share buyback program which was authorized by the Board of Directors in February 2011. Through open market transactions we repurchased approximately 24.4 million shares. In November 2011, we completed our acquisition of the worldwide rights for the Liz Claiborne family of trademarks and related intellectual property, as well as the U.S. and Puerto Rico rights for the Monet trademarks and related intellectual property. In December 2011, we purchased 11 million newly issued shares of Class A common stock and one share of Series A preferred stock of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc. (MSLO) and entered into a strategic alliance with MSLO to create an in store and online retail experience featuring Martha Stewart products. 19 Table of Contents We opened 77 Sephora inside jcpenney beauty boutiques to bring our total to 308 locations, 423 MNG by Mango&reg; shops to bring our total to 500 locations and 502 Call it Spring&reg; shops to bring our total to 505 locations.

Current Developments On January 25, 2012, we revealed our plans to become Americas favorite store. On February 1, 2012, we began the process to transform the jcpenney shopping experience by officially launching our Fair and Square pricing strategy. On February 1, 2012, we also launched our new marketing campaign which includes 12 promotional events that will follow the monthly calendar. See Part I, Item 1, Business, for a discussion of our recently announced business strategy. On January 27, 2012, we converted our existing credit facility into an asset based revolving credit facility and to further enhance our liquidity, on February 10, 2012, we increased the size of our revolving credit facility to $1,500 million. On March 22, 2012, our Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share to be paid to stockholders on May 1, 2012. 20 Table of Contents Results of Operations Three Year Comparison of Operating Performance (in millions, except EPS) 2011 2010 2009 Total net sales $ 17,260 $ 17,759 $ 17,556 Percent (decrease)/increase from prior year (2.8 )% 1.2 % (5.0 )% Comparable store sales increase/(decrease)(1) 0.2 % 2.5 % (6.3 )% Gross margin 6,218 6,960 6,910 Operating expenses/(income): Selling, general and administrative(2) 5,109 5,358 5,410 Pension 121 255 337 Depreciation and amortization 518 511 495 Real estate and other, net 21 (28 ) 5 Restructuring and management transition(3) 451 32 Total operating expenses 6,220 6,128 6,247 Operating (loss)/income (2 ) 832 663 As a percent of sales (0.0 )% 4.7 % 3.8 % Adjusted operating income (non GAAP)(4) 536 1,085 961 As a percent of sales 3.1 % 6.1 % 5.5 % Net interest expense 227 231 260 Bond premiums and unamortized costs 20 (Loss)/income from continuing operations before income taxes (229 ) 581 403 Income tax (benefit)/expense (77 ) 203 154 (Loss)/income from continuing operations $ (152 ) $ 378 $ 249 Adjusted income from continuing operations (non GAAP)(4) $ 207 $ 533 $ 433 Diluted EPS from continuing operations $ (0.70 ) $ 1.59 $ 1.07 Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations (non GAAP)(4) $ 0.94 (5) $ 2.24 $ 1.86 Weighted average shares used for diluted EPS 217.4 238.0 233.1 (1) Comparable store sales are presented on a 52 week basis and include sales from new and relocated stores that have been opened for 12 consecutive full fiscal months and Internet sales. Stores closed for an extended period are not included in comparable store sales calculations, while stores remodeled and minor expansions not requiring store closures remain in the calculations. Our definition and calculation of comparable store sales may differ from other companies in the retail industry. (2) Beginning in 2011, pre opening expenses, previously reported as a separate operating expense line, are included in SG&A expense due to the immaterial nature of such expense in recent years. (3) Beginning in 2011, restructuring and management transition charges were reported as a separate operating expense line. Previously, 2010 charges were included in real estate and other. (4) See Item 6, Selected Financial Data, for a discussion of this non GAAP financial measure and reconciliation to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. (5) Weighted average sharesdiluted of 220.7 million was used for this calculation as adjusted income from continuing operations was positive. 3.3 million shares were added to weighted average sharesbasic of 217.4 million for assumed dilution for stock options, restricted stock awards and stock warrant. We reported a loss from continuing operations of $152 million, or $0.70 per share, in 2011 compared to income of $378 million, or $1.59 per share, in 2010 and income of $249 million, or $1.07 per share, in 2009. Results for 2011 included restructuring and management transition charges of $451 million, or $1.41 per share, which included costs related to activities to streamline our supply chain operations, 21 Table of Contents exit our catalog and catalog outlet businesses, cost savings initiatives to reduce store and home office expenses, the Voluntary Early Retirement Program (VERP), management transition charges related to the hiring and departure of certain members of management and other miscellaneous restructuring costs. Gross margin declined both in dollars and as a percentage of sales due to the highly promotional selling environment and the actions taken to convert to our new pricing strategy in the fourth quarter of 2011. SG&A expense was leveraged against lower sales and declined 60 basis points to 29.6% of sales. Total operating expenses benefited from lower primary pension plan expense by $134 million, or $0.38 per share. Results for 2010 reflected improved profitability achieved by delivering top line sales growth and leveraging operating expenses. Included in results were charges of $32 million, or $0.08 per share, for initial restructuring charges related primarily to the wind down of our catalog and catalog outlet operations and the streamlining of our call center operations and custom decorating business. Total operating expenses benefited from lower primary pension plan expense by $77 million, or approximately $0.22 per share. Earnings for 2010 were favorably impacted by the decrease of our effective income tax rate due to favorable resolution of certain state income tax audits and an increase in our federal wage tax credit. Earnings for 2009 reflected the economic downturn as well as the significant increase in the non cash primary pension plan expense. Notwithstanding these impacts, results benefited significantly from gross margin improvement that reflected the success of our strategy to sell a greater portion of merchandise at regular promotional prices and less at clearance prices. Excluding restructuring and management transition charges and the non cash impact of our primary pension plan expense, adjusted income from continuing operations (non GAAP) was $207 million, or $0.94 per share, in 2011 compared with $533 million, or $2.24 per share, in 2010 and $433 million, or $1.86 per share, in 2009. 2011 Compared to 2010 Total Net Sales Our year to year change in total net sales is comprised of (a) sales from new stores net of closings and relocations including catalog print media and outlet store sales, referred to as non comparable store sales and (b) sales of stores opened in both years as well as Internet sales, referred to as comparable store sales. We consider comparable store sales to be a key indicator of our current performance measuring the growth in sales and sales productivity of existing stores. Positive comparable store sales contribute to greater leveraging of operating costs, particularly payroll and occupancy costs, while negative comparable store sales contribute to de leveraging of costs. Comparable store sales also have a direct impact on our total net sales and the level of cash flow. 2011 2010 Total net sales (in millions) $ 17,260 $ 17,759 Sales percent (decrease)/increase Total net sales (2.8 )% 1.2 % Comparable store sales 0.2 % 2.5 % Sales per gross square foot(1) $ 154 $ 153 (1) Calculation includes the sales and square footage of department stores that were open for the full fiscal year, as well as Internet sales. 22 Table of Contents Total net sales decreased $499 million in 2011 compared to 2010. The following table provides the components of the net sales decrease: ($ in millions) 2011 Comparable store sales, including Internet $ 33 Sales of new (non comparable) stores, net 11 Sales decline through catalog print media and outlet stores (543 ) 2011 total net sales decrease $ (499 ) In 2011, comparable store sales were essentially flat at 0.2%, or $33 million higher, as we experienced a softer than expected selling environment. Sales of non comparable stores opened in 2011 and 2010, net of closings, added $11 million. In 2011, we opened three new department stores and closed seven, while in 2010 we opened two new department stores and closed four. As expected, catalog print media and outlet store sales declined during the year due to the exit from the catalog and outlet store businesses. Internet sales, which are included in comparable store sales, remained essentially flat at $1.5 billion for 2011 and 2010. All components combined, total net sales decreased $499 million or 2.8% in the year. During 2011, off mall traffic increased compared to last year, while mall traffic declined. In addition, our conversion rates for both mall and off mall stores were above 2010 levels. Our average unit retail in jcpenney department stores increased slightly compared to the prior year. The number of store transactions increased during the year, while the number of units sold and units per transaction declined. Sales in all geographic regions remained relatively flat in 2011. Based on comparable store sales, our best sales performance was in the southwest region, with the weakest performance coming from the northwest and central regions. Also based on comparable store sales, our best performing categories were womens apparel and womens accessories, including Sephora. Home and family footwear experienced the weakest performance for the year. Private and exclusive brands found only at jcpenney were 55% of total merchandise sales in 2011 and 2010. Gross Margin Gross margin is a measure of profitability of a retail company at the most fundamental level of buying and selling merchandise and measures a companys ability to effectively manage the total costs of sourcing and allocating merchandise against the corresponding retail pricing. Gross margins not only cover marketing, selling and other operating expenses, but also must include a profit element to reinvest back into the business. Gross margin is the difference between total net sales and cost of the merchandise sold and is typically expressed as a percentage of total net sales. The cost of merchandise sold includes all direct costs of bringing merchandise to its final selling destination. These costs include: cost of the merchandise (net of discounts or allowances earned) freight warehousing sourcing and procurement buying and brand development costs including buyers salaries and related expenses merchandise examination inspection and testing merchandise distribution center expenses shipping and handling costs incurred related to sales to customers 23 Table of Contents ($ in millions) 2011 2010 Gross margin $ 6,218 $ 6,960 As a percent of sales 36.0 % 39.2 % Gross margin decreased to 36.0% of sales, or 320 basis points compared to 2010. On a dollar basis, gross margin decreased $742 million, or 10.7%, to $6,218 million in 2011 compared to $6,960 million in the prior year. The gross margin rate decreased approximately 100 basis points due to higher markdowns as a result of increased promotional activity; approximately 80 basis points due to lower vendor support, higher royalty payments and increased year over year shrinkage; and approximately 20 basis points for certain non comparable free shipping offers for jcp.com combined with higher delivery costs. The gross margin rate was most significantly impacted by the costs associated with implementing our new pricing strategy in the fourth quarter of 2011, decreasing our gross margin rate by 120 basis points. Costs associated with implementing our new pricing strategy included $55 million of labor costs, $12 million of ticket and other miscellaneous costs and $140 million of markdowns of merchandise. The implementation of our new pricing strategy will likely cause quarterly fluctuations in gross margin during 2012 when compared to 2011 as a result of the application of the Retail Inventory Method (RIM). RIM requires adjustments to margin to occur over the selling cycle of inventory to reflect permanent markdowns. Under our new pricing strategy, retail prices are initially set at our every day value; therefore, reductions in the cost of merchandise inventory to reflect permanent markdowns will be smaller throughout the year thereby affecting gross margin. In addition, timing of merchandise markdowns may be impacted as a result of the new marketing promotional calendar. Due to the numerous factors that impact actual gross margin on a quarterly basis, such as the mix of merchandise, merchandising and promotional cadence, volume and price discounts, we are not able to quantify quarterly margin trend results as compared to prior years. Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses The following costs are included in SG&A expenses, except if related to merchandise buying, sourcing, warehousing or distribution activities: salaries marketing occupancy and rent utilities and maintenance information technology administrative costs related to our homeoffice, district and regional operations credit/debit card fees real property, personal property andother taxes (excluding incometaxes) ($ in millions) 2011 2010 SG&A $ 5,109 $ 5,358 As a percent of sales 29.6 % 30.2 % SG&A expenses declined $249 million to $5,109 million in 2011 compared to $5,358 million in 2010. As a percent of sales, SG&A expenses were leveraged and decreased 60 basis points to 29.6% compared to 30.2% in 2010. The reduction was mainly driven by benefits from the jcpenney private label credit card, lower marketing expenses due to the elimination of catalog print media, lower incentive compensation accruals and expense savings realized from cost reduction initiatives. SG&A 24 Table of Contents expense reductions were partially offset by our continuing roll out of Sephora inside jcpenney and investment in our Growth Brand Division, including The Foundry Big & Tall Supply Co. (Foundry stores). Pension Expense ($ in millions) 2011 2010 Primary pension plan expense $ 87 $ 221 Supplemental pension plans expense 34 34 Total pension expense $ 121 $ 255 Total pension expense was $121 million in 2011 compared to $255 million in 2010 and consisted mainly of the primary pension plan expense of $87 million in 2011 versus $221 million for 2010. The 2011 primary pension plan expense declined mainly as a result of the increase in the value of pension plan assets as of the 2010 year end measurement date due to positive market returns in 2010 and our discretionary cash contribution of $392 million in May 2010, partially offset by a 90 basis point decline in our expected return on plan assets. The decline of the expected rate of return is due to our new target allocation strategy to mitigate volatility risk by decreasing the plans asset allocation to equities and shifting to less volatile fixed income investments. Based on our 2011 year end measurement of primary pension plan assets and benefit obligations, we expect our 2012 non cash primary pension plan expense to increase to $194 million compared to $87 million in 2011. The increase is primarily the result of an approximately 80 basis point decrease in our discount rate, an increase in the pension liability resulting from the VERP and a decrease in the value of plan assets due to unfavorable capital market returns in 2011. For more information, see Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements. Depreciation and Amortization Expenses Depreciation and amortization expenses in 2011 increased $7 million to $518 million, or approximately 1.4%, compared to $511 million in 2010 primarily as a result of our store renewals and updates over the past two years. This includes our investment in our in store shops MNG by Mango, Call it Spring and Sephora inside jcpenney. During the year we also opened three new department stores and ten Foundry stores. Real Estate and Other, Net ($ in millions) 2011 2010 Real estate activities $ (38 ) $ (34 ) Net gains from sale of real estate (6 ) (8 ) Impairments 58 3 Other 7 11 Total expense/(income) $ 21 $ (28 ) Real estate and other, net consists of ongoing operating income from our real estate subsidiaries, net gains from the sale of facilities and equipment that are no longer used in our operations, other non operating corporate charges and credits, as well as asset impairment charges. 25 Table of Contents Real estate and other expenses totaled $21 million in 2011 compared to income of $28 million in 2010. Operating income from our real estate activities increased to $38 million from $34 million in the prior year. In 2011 and 2010, we received dividend income from our REITs totaling $10 million and $8 million, respectively. In 2011 and 2010, we recorded investment income for our proportional share of earnings from our joint ventures totaling $13 million and $15 million, respectively. In 2011, store impairments totaled $58 million and related to eight underperforming department stores of which seven continue to operate. In 2010, impairments totaled $3 million and related primarily to one underperforming department store that continues to operate. In 2011 and 2010, other expenses of $7 million and $11 million, respectively, included legal and other advisory costs related to the Companys evaluation of capital restructuring alternatives. Restructuring and Management Transition Charges In 2011 and 2010, we incurred $451 million and $32 million, respectively, of restructuring and management transition charges. Restructuring and management transition charges include costs related to activities to streamline our supply chain operations, exit our catalog and catalog outlet businesses, cost savings initiatives to reduce store and home office expenses, the VERP, management transition charges related to the hiring and departure of certain members of management and other miscellaneous restructuring costs including the exit of our two specialty websites, CLADTM and Gifting GraceTM. ($ in millions) 2011 2010 Supply chain $ 41 $ Catalog and catalog outlet stores 34 21 Employment termination benefits 41 4 VERP 179 Management transition 130 Other 26 7 Total $ 451 $ 32 Supply chain As a result of consolidating and streamlining our supply chain organization as part of a restructuring program during 2011, we recorded $28 million of increased depreciation, $8 million of costs to close and consolidate facilities and $5 million of employee severance. Increased depreciation resulted from shortening the useful lives of assets related to the closing and consolidating of selected facilities. We are expecting to incur a total of approximately $55 million in expense related to this restructuring activity, with $41 million incurred in 2011 and the remainder to be incurred in 2012. Catalog and catalog outlet stores In the fourth quarter of 2010, we announced our plan to exit the catalog outlet stores and wind down our catalog business. As a result, in 2010 we recorded $17 million of increased depreciation and $4 million of employee severance. Increased depreciation resulted from shortening the useful lives of assets associated with our catalog and catalog outlet stores. On October 16, 2011, we completed an asset purchase agreement to sell the assets related to the operations of our catalog outlet stores. We sold fixed assets and inventory with combined net book values of approximately $31 million, for a total purchase price of $7 million, which resulted in a loss of $24 million. In 2011, we also recorded an additional $10 million of severance and other costs related to the sale of our catalog outlet stores. In total for 2011 and 2010, we recorded $55 million related to the exit of our catalog and catalog outlet stores. We do not expect to incur any additional costs related to this program, as the catalog outlet stores were sold during 2011 and the catalog operations were discontinued at the end of 2010. 26 Table of Contents Employment termination benefits In 2011 and 2010, we recorded $41 million and $4 million, respectively, of employee termination benefits for actions to reduce our store and home office expenses. We expect to incur additional charges in 2012 related to this restructuring activity. VERP As a part of several restructuring and cost savings initiatives designed to reduce salary and related costs across the Company, in August of 2011 we announced a VERP which was offered to approximately 8,000 eligible associates. In the third quarter of 2011, we recorded a total charge of $179 million related to the VERP. Charges included $176 million related to enhanced retirement benefits for the approximately 4,000 associates who accepted the VERP, $1 million related to curtailment charges for our Supplemental Retirement Program and Benefit Restoration Plan as a result of the reduction in the expected years of future service related to these plans, and an additional $2 million of costs associated with administering the VERP. This program was completed in 2011 and we do not expect to incur any additional costs related to the enhanced benefits associated with the VERP. Management transition During 2011, we announced and implemented several changes within our management leadership team which resulted in management transition costs of $130 million during the year. Ronald B. Johnson became Chief Executive Officer on November 1, 2011, succeeding Myron E. Ullman, III. Mr. Ullman was Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors until January 27, 2012, at which time he retired from the Company. During 2011, we incurred transition charges of $53 million and $29 million related to Mr. Johnson and Mr. Ullman, respectively. In October 2011, Michael R. Francis was appointed President and as part of his employment package, he was awarded a one time sign on bonus of $12 million. In November 2011, Michael W. Kramer and Daniel E. Walker were appointed Chief Operating Officer and Chief Talent Officer, respectively, and as part of their respective employment packages, they were awarded one time sign on bonuses of $4 million and $8 million, respectively. We also recorded $24 million of management transition charges primarily related to other members of management in 2011. Other In 2011, we recorded $26 million of charges primarily related to the restructuring activities associated with streamlining our custom decorating operations and the exit of our specialty websites CLAD and Gifting Grace. In 2010, we recorded $7 million of charges primarily related to the restructuring activities associated with streamlining our custom decorating operations. In 2011 and 2010, we recorded $4 million and $3 million, respectively, of charges primarily related to increased depreciation as a result of closing and consolidating facilities related to our custom decorating operations. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we recorded $8 million related to the exit of our specialty websites primarily related to employment termination benefits and contract termination costs. In 2011 and 2010, we incurred $14 million and $4 million, respectively, of additional miscellaneous restructuring costs. We expect to incur an additional $2 million of costs associated with the exit of our specialty websites in 2012 related to lease termination costs. We do not expect to incur any additional costs associated with any of the other miscellaneous restructuring programs that were initiated in 2010 and 2011. 27 Table of Contents Future Restructuring In January 2012, we announced a targeted expense reduction of $900 million, primarily SG&A expense, over a two year period beginning in 2012. We expect to achieve savings by reducing costs in our store operations, marketing and in our home office. Efforts to achieve our SG&A expense reductions include the restructuring activities that have occurred and a continuation of some of the restructuring activities outlined above, along with other cost savings initiatives. We expect to incur additional restructuring charges in 2012 related to activities focused on achieving this targeted expense reduction. Operating (Loss)/Income Operating income decreased 470 basis points to (0.0)% of sales in 2011 compared to 4.7% last year. Excluding restructuring and management transition charges and the non cash impact of the primary pension plan expense, adjusted operating income (non GAAP) decreased 300 basis points to 3.1% of sales compared to 6.1% in 2010. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense consists principally of interest expense on long term debt, net of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents. Net interest expense was $227 million, a decrease of $4 million, or 1.7%, from $231 million in 2010. The decrease was primarily due to lower overall debt outstanding during 2011 as compared to 2010 combined with lower interest rate levels resulting from long term debt transactions completed during 2010. Bond Premiums and Unamortized Costs In 2010, we incurred $20 million of additional financing costs, consisting primarily of bond premiums paid in connection with the debt tender offer completed in May 2010. There were no comparable costs in 2011. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate for continuing operations for 2011 was (33.6)% compared with 34.9% for 2010. The rate was positively impacted by federal wage tax credits and negatively impacted by non deductible management transition costs. (Loss)/Income from Continuing Operations In 2011, we reported a loss from continuing operations of $152 million, or $0.70 per share, compared with income from continuing operations of $378 million, or $1.59 per share, last year. Excluding restructuring and management transition charges and the non cash impact of the primary pension plan expense, adjusted income from continuing operations (non GAAP) decreased $326 million to $207 million, or $0.94 per share, compared to $533 million, or $2.24 per share, for 2010. 2010 Compared to 2009 Total Net Sales 2010 2009 Total net sales (in millions) $ 17,759 $ 17,556 Sales percent increase/(decrease) Total net sales 1.2 % (5.0 )% Comparable store sales 2.5 % (6.3 )% Sales per gross square foot(1) $ 153 $ 149 (1) Calculation includes the sales and square footage of department stores that were open for the full fiscal year, as well as Internet sales. 28 Table of Contents Total net sales increased $203 million in 2010 compared to 2009. The following table provides the components of the net sales increase: ($ in millions) 2010 Comparable store sales, including Internet $ 406 Sales of new (non comparable) stores, net 77 Sales decline through catalog print media and outlet stores (280 ) 2010 total net sales increase $ 203 In 2010, comparable store sales increased 2.5% mainly as customers responded to our new merchandise initiatives and the value offered through our private brands. Sales of non comparable stores opened in 2010 and 2009, net of closings, added $77 million. In 2010, we opened two new stores and closed four, while in 2009 we opened 17 new stores and closed or relocated two stores. Catalog print media and outlet store sales declined in 2010 due to the wind down of the catalog business. Internet sales, which are included in comparable store sales, increased 4.4% to slightly more than $1.5 billion for the year. All components combined, total net sales increased $203 million or 1.2% in 2010. During 2010, the percent increase in our off mall store traffic exceeded the increase in our mall traffic, which was also above 2009 levels. In addition, our conversion rates for both mall and off mall stores were above 2009 levels. Our average unit retail was down in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily as a result of a greater portion of promotional sales and a higher proportion of sales in the good and better merchandise categories at lower price points than sales of merchandise in the best category at higher price points. For 2010, our unit sales, number of transactions and units per transaction were higher than 2009. Sales in all geographic regions increased in 2010, with the best performance in the southeast and southwest regions with the weakest in the northwest and northeast regions. Our best performing categories were mens apparel and womens accessories, including Sephora. Home and womens apparel experienced the weakest performance for the year. As a percent of total merchandise sales, private and exclusive brands found only at jcpenney were 55% in 2010 versus 54% in 2009. Gross Margin ($ in millions) 2010 2009 Gross margin $ 6,960 $ 6,910 As a percent of sales 39.2 % 39.4 % Gross margin decreased slightly to 39.2% of sales, or 20 basis points, in 2010 compared to 2009s historic high annual gross margin rate of 39.4%. On a dollar basis, gross margin increased $50 million, or 0.7%, to $6,960 million compared to $6,910 million last year. The gross margin rate decreased due to higher markdowns from increased promotional activity that were somewhat offset by increased vendor support and lower year over year shrinkage, as a result of our shrinkage reduction initiatives. The gross margin level was also negatively impacted by the elimination of catalog print media. 29 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses ($ in millions) 2010 2009 SG&A $ 5,358 $ 5,410 As a percent of sales 30.2 % 30.8 % SG&A expenses declined $52 million to $5,358 million in 2010 compared to $5,410 million in 2009.

A lower incentive compensation accrual for 2010 offset higher store salary costs that were impacted by the minimum wage increase and the resumption of merit increases, as well as the higher salaries associated with the additional Sephora inside jcpenney locations, which are more labor intensive than other departments in the store. The lower incentive compensation accrual was primarily the result of not achieving our sales plan as the discontinuation of the catalog business had a greater impact on sales than expected. In addition, the 2009 accrual included a special one time recognition bonus program for mostly store based hourly associates. Risk insurance expense, as well as health and welfare plan costs were also lower in 2010. Risk insurance expense declined as a result of our workers compensation initiatives and favorable industry trends and health and welfare costs were lower as a result of a decline in participation levels. While our year over year marketing expense was relatively flat with 2009, spending was reallocated from catalog and print media to local and national advertising and online media. Pension Expense ($ in millions) 2010 2009 Primary pension plan expense $ 221 $ 298 Supplemental pension plans expense 34 39 Total pension expense $ 255 $ 337 Total pension expense was $255 million in 2010 compared to $337 million in 2009 and consisted mainly of the primary pension plan expense of $221 million in 2010 versus $298 million for 2009. The 2010 primary pension plan expense declined mainly as a result of an increase in the value of pension plan assets as of the 2009 year end measurement date due to positive market returns in 2009 combined with our May 2009 discretionary contribution of common stock to the plan. Depreciation and Amortization Expenses Depreciation and amortization expenses in 2010 increased $16 million to $511 million, or approximately 3.2%, compared to $495 million in 2009 primarily as a result of our continued investment in store renewals and updates. Real Estate and Other, Net ($ in millions) 2010 2009 Real estate activities $ (34) $ (34) Net gains from sale of real estate (8) (2) Impairments 3 42 Other 11 (1) Total (income)/expense $ (28) $ 5 30 Table of Contents Real estate and other, net was income of $28 million in 2010 compared to expense of $5 million in 2009. Operating income from our real estate activities was consistent year over year at $34 million. We received dividend income from our REITs totaling $8 million in both 2010 and 2009. We recorded investment income for our proportional share of earnings from our joint ventures totaling $15 million in both 2010 and 2009. Gains from the sale of real estate were $6 million higher in 2010 from the sale of two properties. In 2010, impairments totaled $3 million and related primarily to one underperforming store that continues to operate. In 2009, impairments totaled $42 million and related to seven underperforming department stores and other corporate assets. Other expenses of $11 million in 2010 included legal and other advisory costs related to the Companys evaluation of capital restructuring alternatives. Restructuring and Management Transition Charges ($ in millions) 2010 2009 Catalog and catalog outlet stores $ 21 $ Employment termination benefits 4 Other 7 Total expense $ 32 $ Restructuring and management transition charges in 2010 included $32 million of initial restructuring charges related primarily to the wind down of our catalog and catalog outlet store businesses and streamlining the related call center operations and facility consolidation within our custom decorating business. Operating Income Operating income increased 90 basis points to 4.7% of sales in 2010 compared to 3.8% in 2009. Excluding the non cash impact of the primary pension plan expense and restructuring and management transition charges, adjusted operating income (non GAAP) increased 60 basis points to 6.1% of sales compared to 5.5% in 2009. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense consists principally of interest expense on long term debt, net of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents. Net interest expense was $231 million, a decrease of $29 million, or 11.2%, from $260 million in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to lower debt levels combined with lower interest rate levels resulting from long term debt transactions completed during the year. Bond Premiums and Unamortized Costs In 2010, we incurred $20 million of additional financing costs, consisting primarily of bond premiums paid in connection with the debt tender offer completed in May 2010. There were no comparable costs in 2009. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate for continuing operations for 2010 was 34.9% compared with 38.2% for 2009. The tax rate decreased due to favorable resolution of certain state income tax audits combined with changes in state tax laws and an increase in our federal wage tax credit. 31 Table of Contents Income from Continuing Operations Income from continuing operations for 2010 increased 51.8% to $378 million, or $1.59 per share, compared with $249 million, or $1.07 per share, in 2009. Excluding the non cash impact of the primary pension plan expense and restructuring and management transition charges, adjusted income from continuing operations (non GAAP) increased 23.1% to $533 million, or $2.24 per share, compared to $433 million, or $1.86 per share, for 2009. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations in 2010 generated a credit of $11 million, net of $4 million of income tax expense, or $0.04 per share, compared to a credit of $2 million, net of $1 million of income tax expense, or $0.01 per share, in 2009, and primarily reflected a reduction in the environmental reserve we retained when we sold our drugstore business. The reduction to the reserve was due in part to the affirmation of an additional responsible party to one of the known sites involving a warehouse facility, as well as an update for actual historical experience. These discontinued operations are not expected to have a future material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 32 Table of Contents Financial Condition and Liquidity Overview In 2011, we continued to have a strong balance sheet and liquidity position. The cornerstone of our strength is our cash and cash equivalent balances and our ability to generate positive free cash flow (non GAAP). For 2011, we ended the year with $1.5 billion of cash and cash equivalent balances after using cash on hand to complete a $900 million share buyback program, purchase the worldwide rights for the Liz Claiborne family of trademarks and related intellectual property and the U.S. and Puerto Rico rights for the Monet family of trademarks and related intellectual property and invest in MSLO. We also ended the year with positive free cash flow of $23 million. At the end of 2011, our cash to debt ratio was about 49%, while our debt to total capital ratio was approximately 44%. In addition to cash flow and cash and cash equivalent balances, as of year end 2011 our revolving credit facility provided an additional $1,250 million source of liquidity. Other than the issuance of trade and standby letters of credit, which totaled $144 million at year end 2011, we did not utilize this facility during 2011. To further enhance our liquidity, on February 10, 2012, we increased the size of our revolving credit facility to $1,500 million. The following table provides a summary of our key components and ratios of financial condition and liquidity: ($ in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,507 $ 2,622 $ 3,011 Merchandise inventory 2,916 3,213 3,024 Property and equipment, net 5,176 5,231 5,357 Long term debt, including current maturities $ 3,102 $ 3,099 $ 3,392 Stockholders equity 4,010 5,460 4,778 Total capital $ 7,112 $ 8,559 $ 8,170 Maximum capacity under our credit agreements(1) $ 1,250 $ 750 $ 750 Cash flow from operating activities 820 592 (2) 1,573 (3) Free cash flow (non GAAP) (4) 23 158 677 Capital expenditures 634 499 600 Dividends paid 178 189 183 Ratios and measures: Debt to total capital(5) 43.6 % 36.2 % 41.5 % Cash to debt(6) 48.6 % 84.6 % 88.8 % (1) On January 27, 2012, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement in which we converted our prior credit facility into an asset based revolving credit facility. On February 10, 2012, we increased the size of our revolving credit facility to $1,500 million. (2) Includes a $392 million discretionary cash contribution and a related $152 million tax benefit. (3) Included a $126 million tax benefit as a result of the contribution of common stock to the primary pension plan. (4) See Item 6, Selected Financial Data, for a discussion of this non GAAP financial measure and reconciliation to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. (5) Long term debt, including current maturities divided by total capital. (6) Cash and cash equivalents divided by long term debt, including current maturities. Cash and Cash Equivalents At year end 2011, we had $1.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents, which represented approximately 49% of our $3.1 billion of outstanding long term debt, including current maturities. Cash and cash 33 Table of Contents equivalents decreased $1,115 million in 2011 after cash uses that included $900 million to complete a share buyback program, $268 million to purchase the worldwide rights for the Liz Claiborne family of trademarks and related intellectual property and the U.S. and Puerto Rico rights for the Monet family of trademarks and related intellectual property and $39 million to invest in MSLO. Our cash investments are held in U.S. Treasury money market funds and a portfolio of highly rated bank deposits. In addition to cash and cash equivalents, as of year end 2011 our liquidity position included a $1,250 million asset based revolving credit facility. To further enhance our liquidity, on February 10, 2012, we increased the size of our revolving credit facility to $1,500 million. Our 2010 and 2007 debt issuances contain a change of control provision that would obligate us, at the holders option, to repurchase the debt at a price of 101%. These provisions trigger if there were a beneficial ownership change of 50% or more of our common stock and, for the 2010 issuance, if the debt is downgraded from the Companys credit rating level at the time of issuance, for the 2007 issuances, if the debt was rated non investment grade. This provision applies to $1.1 billion of our debt. Free Cash Flow (non GAAP) Free cash flow (non GAAP) is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, excluding discretionary cash contributions to our primary pension plan and any associated cash tax impacts, less capital expenditures and dividends paid, plus proceeds from the sale of assets. Our 2011 free cash flow was $23 million compared to $158 million in 2010. This decrease was primarily the result of an increase in capital expenditures. Operating Activities Our operations are seasonal in nature, with the business depending to a great extent on the last quarter of the year when a significant portion of the sales, profits and positive operating cash flows are realized. Cash requirements are highest in the third quarter as we build inventory levels in preparation for the holiday season. 2011 cash flow from operating activities was $820 million, an increase of $228 million from the prior year. In 2010, our cash flow from operating activities was impacted by a $392 million discretionary pension contribution which resulted in a tax benefit of $152 million, for a net use of cash of $240 million. Although operating performance was lower in 2011 as compared to 2010, this was offset as we managed inventories at lower levels during 2011. Total inventory was $2,916 million at the end of 2011, a decrease of 9.2% from 2010. In 2010, in response to the recovering environment, we maintained a higher level of merchandise inventory. At the end of 2011, we edited our assortments and lowered inventory levels as compared to the prior year in support of our new business strategy. Inventory turns for 2011, 2010 and 2009 were 3.09, 3.05 and 3.15, respectively. 2010 cash flow from operating activities was $592 million, a decrease of approximately $981 million from the prior year. The decrease was primarily attributable to higher receipts of merchandise inventory, the discretionary pension contribution, and higher payments of incentive compensation, partially offset by lower income taxes paid. 34 Table of Contents Investing Activities ($ in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net cash (used in)/provided by: Capital expenditures $ (634 ) $ (499 ) $ (600 ) Proceeds from sale of assets 15 14 13 Proceeds from joint venture distribution 53 Acquisition (268 ) Cost investment, net (36 ) Investing activities $ (870 ) $ (485 ) $ (587 ) In 2011, we invested $634 million in capital expenditures for renewals and modernizations, three new jcpenney department stores, 77 Sephora inside jcpenney locations, 423 MNG by Mango shops, 502 Call it Spring shops and the opening of 10 Foundry stores. In 2011, we purchased the worldwide rights for the Liz Claiborne family of trademarks and related intellectual property and the U.S. and Puerto Rico rights for the Monet family of trademarks and related intellectual property for a total purchase price of $268 million and invested $39 million through the purchase of 11 million newly issued shares of Class A common stock of MSLO and one share of MSLO preferred stock which gave us the right to designate two members of MSLOs Board of Directors. These uses of cash were partially offset by the receipt of a $53 million cash distribution from one of our real estate joint ventures as a result of a refinancing transaction and a $3 million cash distribution from MSLO that was recorded as a return of investment. In 2010, we invested $499 million in capital expenditures for two new stores, 26 major renovations, 76 new Sephora inside jcpenney locations, 15 store refurbishments, and fixture and store environment improvements in over 500 stores. In 2009, we invested $600 million in capital expenditures for 17 new stores, 16 in our off mall format, and our store in Manhattan, 64 new Sephora inside jcpenney locations, 20 major capital improvements, 22 store refurbishments, fixture and store environment improvements in over 500 stores and technology.

Our plan is to fund these expenditures with cash flow from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents balances. Capital expenditures for 2012 will relate primarily to the investment in our shops inside jcpenney stores and technology improvements. 35 Table of Contents Financing Activities ($ in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net cash (used in)/provided by: Proceeds from issuance of long term debt $ $ 392 $ Payments of long term debt, including financing costs (20 ) (707 ) (145 ) Dividends paid (178 ) (189 ) (183 ) Proceeds from issuance of stock warrant 50 Stock repurchase program (900 ) Other (17 ) 8 1 Total $ (1,065 ) $ (496 ) $ (327 ) During the first half of 2011, we completed our share buyback program authorized by the Board of Directors in February 2011. Through open market transactions we repurchased approximately 24.4 million shares at a cost of $900 million and an average price of $36.98. In June 2011, we received proceeds of approximately $50 million for the sale of a warrant on 7.3 million shares of J. C. Penney Company, Inc. common stock to Ronald B. Johnson prior to the commencement of his employment. In April 2011, we paid $15 million in fees to renew our revolving credit facility and in January 2012, we paid $5 million in fees for an amendment and restatement of our credit facility, for a total of $20 million. In 2011, we maintained our quarterly dividend on common stock at $0.20 per share and returned $178 million to stockholders through dividend payments. The Board periodically reviews the dividend policy and rate, taking into consideration our overall financial and strategic outlook, earnings, liquidity and cash flow projections, as well as competitive factors. In 2010, we completed several financing transactions. On March 1, 2010, we repaid at maturity $393 million principal amount of 8.0% Notes due 2010. In May, we paid aggregate consideration of $314 million, including accrued but unpaid interest, to purchase $300 million principal amount of JCPs outstanding 6.375% Senior Notes due 2036, which were validly tendered pursuant to a cash tender offer. Also in May, we closed on our offering of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 5.65% Senior Notes due 2020 and used proceeds of the offering, net of discounts, of $392 million to make a voluntary cash contribution to the J. C. Penney Corporation, Inc. Pension Plan. During 2010, we returned $189 million to stockholders through dividend payments. In 2009, pursuant to a cash tender offer, we accepted for purchase $104 million principal amount of the 8% Notes due March 1, 2010 and purchased another $9 million of these notes in the open market. There were no issuances of new debt during 2009. We paid financing costs of $32 million, which consisted of Credit Facility fees and premiums on early retirement of debt from our cash tender offer. During 2009, we returned $183 million to stockholders through dividend payments. Cash Flow and Financing Outlook On January 27, 2012, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement in which we converted our prior credit facility into an asset based revolving credit facility. To further enhance our liquidity, on February 10, 2012, we increased the size of our revolving credit facility to $1,500 million. 36 Table of Contents We estimate our capital expenditures for the year to be $800 million and we plan to fund these amounts with cash flow from operations and existing cash and cash equivalent balances. Capital expenditures for 2012 will relate primarily to the investment in our shops inside jcpenney stores and technology improvements. Our next scheduled debt maturity is in August 2012 for $230 million. We may pay this debt maturity with cash flow from operations and existing cash and cash equivalent balances; however, in accordance with our long term financing strategy, we may access the capital markets opportunistically. We may borrow under our credit facility for general corporate purposes including, but not limited to, seasonal working capital needs and to support ongoing letters of credit. Credit Facility On January 27, 2012, J. C. Penney Company, Inc., JCP and J. C. Penney Purchasing Corporation entered into a revolving credit facility in an amount up to $1,250 million (2012 Credit Facility), which amended and restated the Companys prior credit agreement entered into in April 2011, with the same syndicate of lenders under the previous agreement, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. The 2012 Credit Facility matures on April 29, 2016. The 2012 Credit Facility is an asset based revolving credit facility and is secured by a perfected first priority security interest in substantially all of our credit card receivables, accounts receivable and inventory. The 2012 Credit Facility is available for general corporate purposes, including the issuance of letters of credit. Pricing under the 2012 Credit Facility is tiered based on JCPs senior unsecured long term credit ratings issued by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poors Ratings Services. JCPs obligations under the 2012 Credit Facility are guaranteed by J. C. Penney Company, Inc. Availability under the 2012 Credit Facility is limited to a borrowing base which allows us to borrow up to 85% of eligible accounts receivable, plus 90% of eligible credit card receivables, plus 85% of the liquidation value of our inventory, net of certain reserves. Letters of credit reduce the amount available to borrow by their face value. In the event that availability under the 2012 Credit Facility is at any time less than the greater of (1) $125 million or (2) 10% of the lesser of the total facility or the borrowing base then in effect, for a period of at least 30 days, the Company will be subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant of 1.0 to 1.0 which is calculated as of the last day of the quarter and measured on a trailing four quarter basis. The 2012 Credit Facility contains covenants including, but not limited to, restrictions on the Companys and its subsidiaries ability to incur indebtedness; grant liens on assets; guarantee obligations; merge, consolidate, or sell assets; pay dividends or make other restricted payments; make investments; prepay or modify certain indebtedness; engage in transactions with affiliates; or enter into sale leaseback transactions under certain conditions. We may borrow under our credit facility for general corporate purposes including, but not limited to, seasonal working capital needs and to support ongoing letters of credit. Our letters of credit totaled $144 million at the end of 2011. To further enhance our liquidity, on February 10, 2012, we increased the size of our revolving credit facility to $1,500 million. 37 Table of Contents Credit Ratings Our credit ratings and outlook as of March 19, 2012 were as follows: Long TermDebt Outlook Moodys Investors Service, Inc.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Management considers all on and off balance sheet debt in evaluating our overall liquidity position and capital structure. Other than operating leases, which are included in the Contractual Obligations and Commitments table, we do not have any material off balance sheet financing. See detailed disclosure regarding operating leases and their off balance sheet present value in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. We do not have any additional arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements. Common Stock The number of outstanding shares of common stock was 215.9 million at the end of 2011, 236.7 million at the end of 2010 and 236.0 million at the end of 2009. The decrease in 2011 was primarily the result of our share buyback program in which we repurchased approximately 24.4 million shares through open market transactions. Inflation While inflation did not significantly impact our results of operations during the past three years, the retail industry has experienced inflationary cost increases. We have experienced cost increases primarily in the latter part of 2011 driven primarily by rising costs for cotton and petroleum based textiles. We have programs in place to mitigate the effects of inflation that include adjusting our product mix, leveraging our sourcing capabilities, and where appropriate, increasing prices and reducing our promotional activity. 39 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that we make estimates and use assumptions that in some instances may materially affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In preparing these financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments based on history and current trends, as well as other factors that we believe are relevant at the time of the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Historically, actual results have not differed materially from estimates; however, future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty and as a result, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates. We have discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to these policies in this MD&A. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies. Inventory Valuation under the Retail Method Inventories are valued primarily at the lower of cost (using the first in, first out or FIFO method) or market, determined under RIM for department stores, store distribution centers and regional warehouses and standard cost, representing average vendor cost, for merchandise we sell through the Internet at jcp.com. Under RIM, retail values are converted to a cost basis by applying specific average cost factors to groupings of merchandise. RIM inherently requires management judgment and certain estimates that may significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost, as well as gross margin. Two of the most significant estimates are permanent reductions to retail prices (markdowns) used primarily to clear seasonal merchandise or otherwise slow moving inventory and inventory shortage (shrinkage). Permanent markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded at the point of decision, when the utility of inventory has diminished, versus the point of sale. Factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand, customer preferences, age of the merchandise and style trends. Under RIM, permanent markdowns result in the devaluation of inventory and the corresponding reduction to gross margin is recognized in the period the decision to markdown is made. Shrinkage is estimated as a percent of sales for the period from the last physical inventory date to the end of the fiscal period. Physical inventories are taken at least annually and inventory records are adjusted accordingly. The shrinkage rate from the most recent physical inventory, in combination with current events and historical experience, is used as the standard for the shrinkage accrual rate for the next inventory cycle. Historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable. Based on prior experience, we do not believe that the actual results will differ significantly from the assumptions used in these estimates. A 10% increase or decrease in the permanent markdowns reflected in our inventory as of the end of the year would have impacted net income by approximately $22 million. A 10% increase or decrease in the estimated inventory shrinkage accrued as of the end of the year would have impacted net income by approximately $7 million. 40 Table of Contents Valuation of Long Lived Assets We evaluate recoverability of long lived assets, such as property and equipment, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, such as historical operating losses or plans to close stores and dispose of or sell long lived assets before the end of their previously estimated useful lives. Additionally, for store assets, in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, we separately test the performance of individual stores, and underperforming stores are selected for further evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying amounts. If the evaluation, performed on an undiscounted cash flow basis, indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, the potential impairment is measured as the excess of carrying value over the fair value of the impaired asset. The impairment calculation requires us to apply estimates for future cash flows and use judgments for qualitative factors such as local market conditions, operating environment, mall performance and other trends. We estimate fair value based on either a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate that is considered commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model or appraised value, as appropriate. We recognize impairment losses in the earliest period that it is determined a loss has occurred. The carrying value is adjusted to the new carrying value and any subsequent increases in fair value are not recorded. If it is determined that the estimated remaining useful life of the asset should be decreased, the periodic depreciation expense is adjusted based on the new carrying value of the asset. Impairment losses totaling $58 million, $3 million and $42 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, were recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in the real estate and other, net line item. The $58 million charge for 2011 was related to eight underperforming department stores of which seven continue to operate. While we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate long lived asset impairments, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may be exposed to additional impairment charges. Reserves and Valuation Allowances We are primarily self insured for costs related to workers compensation and general liability claims. The liabilities represent our best estimate, using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods through which we record a provision for workers compensation and general liability risk based on historical experience, current claims data and independent actuarial best estimates, including incurred but not reported claims and projected loss development factors. These estimates are subject to the frequency, lag and severity of claims. We target this provision above the midpoint of the actuarial range, and total estimated claim liability amounts are discounted using a risk free rate. We do not anticipate any significant change in loss trends, settlements or other costs that would cause a significant fluctuation in net income. However, a 10% variance in the workers compensation and general liability reserves at year end 2011 would have affected net income by approximately $15 million. Income taxes are estimated for each jurisdiction in which we operate and require significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. This involves assessing the current tax exposure together with temporary differences, which result from differing treatment of items for tax and book purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are provided for based on these assessments. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for recoverability based on estimated future taxable income. To the extent that recovery is deemed unlikely, a valuation allowance is recorded. We record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, in an income tax return. We recognize any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in 41 Table of Contents income tax expense. Significant judgment is required in assessing, among other things, the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. In assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets, we use estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income. Tax contingency accruals are evaluated and adjusted as appropriate, while taking into account the progress of audits of various taxing jurisdictions. We do not expect the outcome of tax audits to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. Many years of data have been incorporated into the determination of tax reserves, and our estimates have historically been reasonable. In establishing our reserves for liabilities associated with underground storage tanks, we maintain and periodically update an inventory listing of potentially impacted sites. The estimated cost of remediation efforts is based on our historical experience, as well as industry and other published data. With respect to our former drugstore operations, we accessed extensive databases of environmental matters, including data from the Environmental Protection Agency, to estimate the cost of remediation. Our experience, as well as relevant data, was used to develop a range of potential liabilities, and a reserve was established at the time of the sale of our drugstore business. The reserve is adjusted as payments are made or new information becomes known. In 2010, we lowered the reserve due to the affirmation of another responsible party to one of the known sites involving a warehouse facility and review of our actual experience over the past several years. Reserves for asbestos removal are based on our known liabilities in connection with approved plans for store modernization, renovations or dispositions of store locations. We believe the established reserves, as adjusted, are adequate to cover estimated potential liabilities. Pension Pension Accounting We maintain a qualified funded defined benefit pension plan (primary plan) and smaller non qualified unfunded supplemental defined benefit plans. The determination of pension expense is the result of actuarial calculations that are based on important assumptions about pension assets and liabilities. The most important of these are the rate of return on assets and the discount rate assumptions. These assumptions require significant judgment and a change in any one of them could have a material impact on pension expense reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss)/Income, as well as in the assets, liability and equity sections of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following table reflects our rate of return and discount rate assumptions: 2011 2010 2009 Expected return on plan assets 7.5 % 8.4 % 8.4 % Discount rate for pension expense  5.65 %(1)  5.90 % 6.86 %(2) Discount rate for pension obligation 4.82 % 5.65 % 5.90 % (1) The discount rate used for the Supplemental Retirement Program and Benefit Restoration Plan was revised to 5.06% on the remeasurement date of October 15, 2011 as a result of the VERP. (2) For the first four months of 2009, the discount rate was 6.95% as determined by the January 31, 2009 annual measurement. The discount rate was revised to 6.86% on the remeasurement date of May 18, 2009. The supplemental plans and retiree medical plans used 6.95% for the year, since those plans were not subject to remeasurement. 42 Table of Contents Return on Plan Assets and Impact on Earnings For the primary plan, we apply our expected return on plan assets using fair market value as of the annual measurement date. The fair market value method results in greater volatility to our pension expense than the more commonly used calculated value method (referred to as smoothing of assets). Our primary plan asset base is well diversified with an asset allocation mix of equities (U.S., non U.S. and private), fixed income (investment grade and high yield) and real estate (private and public). As of January 1, 2007, the primary plan was closed to new entrants. As a result of this action, the future growth of the plan liability is expected to moderate and ultimately begin to decline. In recognition of the changing liability characteristics and to provide a more desirable balance of investment return and volatility risk, last year, we shifted 15% of the plans allocation from equities to fixed income. The shift to a higher mix of fixed income investments will provide a better match to the plans changing liability characteristics. As a result of the asset allocation shift, our expected return on plan assets was reduced to 7.5% in 2011 and will remain at that rate for 2012. In 2010 and 2009, the expected return on plan assets was 8.4%. Discount Rate The discount rate assumption used to determine our postretirement obligations was based on an externally published yield curve determined by the plans actuary. The yield curve is a hypothetical AA yield curve represented by a series of bonds maturing from six months to 30 years, designed to match the corresponding pension benefit cash payments to retirees. Each underlying bond issue is required to have a rating of Aa2 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or a rating of AA or better by Standard & Poors Ratings Services. For 2011, the discount rate to measure pension expense was 5.65% compared to 5.90% in 2010. For 2009, the discount rate initially increased to 6.95% from 6.54% as of January 31, 2009 and then slightly decreased to 6.86% from 6.95% for the May 18, 2009 remeasurement, which had an overall small positive impact on 2009 pension expense. The discount rate was adjusted in May 2009 for the remeasurement of plan assets and obligations to reflect the voluntary contribution of 13.4 million shares of Company common stock and update other pension liability assumptions. The discount rate to measure pension obligation declined to 4.82% as of January 28, 2012 from 5.65% as of January 29, 2011. Sensitivity The sensitivity of the pension expense to a plus or minus one half of one percent of expected return on assets is a decrease or increase in expense of approximately $0.08 per share. An increase or decrease in the discount rate of one half of one percent would decrease or increase the expense by approximately $0.14 per share. Pension Funding Funding requirements for our primary plan are determined under Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) rules, as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. As a result of the funded status of the primary plan, we are not required to make cash contributions in 2012. Our funding policy is to maintain a well funded pension plan throughout all business and economic cycles. Consistent with our funding policy, on May 24, 2010, we used net proceeds of approximately $392 million from the issuance of $400 million of 5.65% Senior Notes due 2020 to make a voluntary 43 Table of Contents cash contribution to the primary plan. In 2009, we voluntarily contributed approximately 13.4 million newly issued shares of Company common stock to the primary plan. The contribution was valued at $340 million, based on a price of $25.39 per share, reflecting a 6.5% discount to the closing price of the Companys common stock on May 18, 2009. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information This Annual Report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements made within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which reflect our current view of future events and financial performance. The words expect, plan, anticipate, believe, intend, should, will and similar expressions identify forward looking statements. Any such forward looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to be materially different from planned or expected results. Those risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions, including inflation, recession, unemployment levels, consumer spending patterns, credit availability and debt levels, changes in store traffic trends, the cost of goods, trade restrictions, the impact of changes designed to transform our business, changes in tariff, freight and shipping rates, changes in the cost of fuel and other energy and transportation costs, increases in wage and benefit costs, competition and retail industry consolidations, interest rate fluctuations, dollar and other currency valuations, risks associated with war, an act of terrorism or pandemic, a systems failure and or security breach that results in the theft, transfer or unauthorized disclosure of customer, employee or Company information and legal and regulatory proceedings. Furthermore, our Company typically earns a disproportionate share of its operating income in the fourth quarter due to holiday buying patterns, and such buying patterns are difficult to forecast with certainty. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is impossible to predict the degree to which any such factors could cause actual results to differ materially from predicted results. For additional discussion on risks and uncertainties, see Item 1A, Risk Factors. We intend the forward looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K to speak only as of the date of this report and do not undertake to update or revise these projections as more information becomes available. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. We maintain a majority of our cash and cash equivalents in financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less. Such investments are subject to interest rate risk and may have a small decline in value if interest rates increase. Since the financial instruments are of short duration, a change of 100 basis points in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial condition. All of our outstanding long term debt as of January 28, 2012 is at fixed interest rates and would not be affected by interest rate changes. Future borrowings under our multi year revolving credit facility, to the extent that fluctuating rate loans were used, would be affected by interest rate changes. As of January 28, 2012, no borrowings were outstanding under the facility other than the issuance of trade and standby letters of credit, which totaled $144 million. We do not believe that a change of 100 basis points in interest rates would have a material effect on our financial condition. 44 Table of Contents The fair value of long term debt is estimated by obtaining quotes from brokers or is based on current rates offered for similar debt. At January 28, 2012, long term debt, including current maturities, had a carrying value of $3.1 billion and a fair value of $3.0 billion. At January 29, 2011, long term debt had a carrying value and fair value of $3.1 billion. The effects of changes in the U.S. equity and bond markets serve to increase or decrease the value of assets in our primary pension plan. We seek to manage exposure to adverse equity and bond returns by maintaining diversified investment portfolios and utilizing professional investment managers.
