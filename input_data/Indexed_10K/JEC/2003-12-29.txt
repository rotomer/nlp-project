Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements, and the financial statements of any business entity performing long term engineering and construction type contracts, requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect both the entitys results of operations as well as the carrying values of its assets and liabilities. Although our significant accounting polices are described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the following discussion is intended to describe those accounting policies most critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Page 19 Table of Contents Revenue Accounting for Contracts In accounting for long term, engineering and construction type contracts, we follow the provisions of the AICPAs Statement of Position 81 1 Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts. In general, we recognize revenues at the time we provide services. Depending on the commercial terms of the contracts, we recognize revenues either when costs are incurred, or using the percentage of completion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion. Contract losses are provided for in their entirety in the period they become known, without regard to the percentage of completion. The nature of our business results in clients, subcontractors or vendors occasionally presenting claims against us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur, or for which they believe they are not contractually responsible. Similarly, and in the normal course of business, we may present claims to our clients for costs we have incurred for which we believe we are not contractually responsible. In those situations where a claim against us may result in additional costs to the contract, we would include in the total estimated costs of the contract (and therefore, the estimated amount of margin to be earned under the contract) an estimate, based on the relevant facts and circumstances available, of the additional costs to be incurred. In those situations where we have incurred additional costs for which we believe the client is contractually responsible, we may present a claim to the client for such costs. We will include in revenues the amount of costs incurred, without profit, to the extent it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue, and the amount of such additional revenue can be reliably estimated. Costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in revenues using substantially the same criteria used for claims. Certain cost reimbursable contracts with the U.S. federal government as well as certain commercial clients provide that contract costs are subject to audit and adjustment. In this situation, revenues are recorded at the time services are performed based upon the amounts we expect to realize upon completion of the contracts. In those situations where an audit indicates that we may have billed a client for costs not allowable under the terms of the contract, we will estimate the amount of such nonbillable costs and adjust our revenues accordingly. As is common in the industry, we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through partnerships and joint ventures. For certain of these contracts (i.e., where we have an undivided interest in the assets and liabilities of the venture), we recognize our proportionate share of joint venture revenues, costs and operating profit in our consolidated statement of earnings. For other investments in engineering and construction joint ventures, we use the equity method of accounting. Insurance Matters, Litigation, Claims, and Contingencies In the normal course of business, we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation. Generally, such guarantees relate to project schedules and plant performance. Most of the litigation involves the Company as a defendant in workers compensation, personal injury, environmental, environmental exposure, professional liability, and other similar lawsuits. We maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations. However, we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles, limits and retentions under our insurance programs. This situation may subject us to some future liability for which we are only partially insured, or completely uninsured. Additionally, our income, franchise and similar tax returns and filings are subject to audit and investigation by the Internal Revenue Service, most states in the United States, as well as by various government agencies representing jurisdictions outside the United States in which we operate. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5 Accounting for Contingencies, we record in our consolidated balance sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such claims, guarantees, litigation, and audits and investigations. We rely on qualified actuaries to assist us in determining the level of reserves to establish for both insurance Page 20 Table of Contents related claims that are known and have been asserted against us as well as for insurance related claims that are believed to have been incurred based on actuarial analysis, but have not yet been reported to our claims administrators as of the respective balance sheet dates. We include any adjustments to such insurance reserves in our consolidated results of operations. Testing Goodwill for Impairment In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), the amount of goodwill carried on our consolidated balance sheet is tested annually for possible impairment. In conducting the impairment test, we may apply, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142, various techniques to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. These techniques are inherently subjective and the resulting values are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of our reporting units to a willing third party. Since the adoption of SFAS 142 in fiscal 2002, we have not recorded any impairment loss associated with our goodwill. Operations Outside the United States In general, our principal exposure to fluctuating exchange rates relates to the effects of translating the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries, which are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, into the U.S. dollar. We follow the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52 Foreign Currency Translation in preparing our consolidated financial statements. We believe our exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies may have on our consolidated results of operations is limited because our various operations invoice clients and satisfy their financial obligations primarily in their respective local currencies. In situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currencies, we strive to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs. Accounting for Pensions As more fully explained in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we sponsor various defined benefit pension plans. The one remaining U.S. pension plan, which was acquired in connection with our 1999 merger with Sverdrup Corporation, was frozen in 1999, allowing no new participants to enter. Our other pension plans cover employees of certain of our international subsidiaries. We account for these plans in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87 Employers Accounting for Pensions. SFAS 87 requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost, and the value of the plans assets and liabilities. These assumptions involve discount rates, investment returns, and projected salary increases, among others. We rely on qualified actuaries to assist us in valuing the financial position of the plans, and to provide advice regarding the actuarial assumptions used. During fiscal 2003, we reduced our expected rate of return on plan assets from a range of 8% to 9.5% in fiscal 2002 to a range of 8% to 9% in fiscal 2003. We believe this reduction better reflects the long term returns expected on the plans assets, considering projected rates of inflation, the diversification of the plans assets, and the expected real rates of market returns. Changes in the actuarial assumptions may have a material affect on the plans assets and liabilities, and the associated pension expense. Management, together with our actuaries, monitors trends in the marketplace within which our pension plans operate in order to assure the fairness of the actuarial assumptions used. Also discussed in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements is our obligation to form a pension plan and an early retirement plan (VUT) for substantially all of our employees located in the Netherlands. These plans will replace existing programs sponsored by Stork N.V. When the replacement plans are designed and formed, we will negotiate with both Stork N.V. and the trustees of the existing multi employer plans to set a value of the assets to be transferred into the replacement plans. Although we have not finalized the design of the replacement pension and VUT plans, we Page 21 Table of Contents expect that the value of the assets that will be transferred will be less than the value of the benefit obligations we will agree to assume. Such prior service cost will be amortized against earnings over the future estimated service period of our employees in the Netherlands. Results of Operations Our business is focused exclusively on providing technical, professional, and construction services to a large number of industrial, commercial, and governmental clients around the world. The services we provide generally fall into four broad categories: project services (which includes engineering, design, architectural, and similar services); construction services (which includes revenues earned from traditional field construction activities as well as modular construction activities); operations and maintenance (O&M) services (which includes revenues from contracts requiring us to operate and maintain large, complex facilities on behalf of clients as well as contracts involving process plant maintenance services and activities); and process, scientific, and systems consulting services (which includes revenues earned from providing a wide variety of scientific and consulting services to clients). The scope of services we can provide our clients, therefore, ranges from consulting and conceptual design services (which are often required by clients in the very early stages of a project) to complete, single responsibility, design build operate contracts. The following table sets forth our revenues by type of service for each year ended September 30 (in thousands): 2003 2002 2001 Project Services $ 1,894,777 $ 1,977,173 $ 1,807,831 Construction 2,050,144 1,932,613 1,569,781 Operations and Maintenance 444,825 469,508 445,742 Process, Scientific and Systems Consulting 225,855 176,367 133,639 $ 4,615,601 $ 4,555,661 $ 3,956,993 Beginning with the second quarter of fiscal 2002, we classify certain elements of revenues as Construction that were classified previously as Project Services. Consequently, we reclassified approximately $110.4 million of project services revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2002 to construction revenues. Revenues for fiscal 2001 have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2002 and 2003 presentation. We focus our services on certain industry groups and markets that we believe have sufficient common needs to permit cross utilization of our resources. The following table sets forth our revenues by these industry groups and markets for each year ended September 30 (in thousands): 2003 2002 2001 Oil & Gas and Refining $ 1,093,047 $ 1,088,758 $ 451,103 Federal Programs 1,070,740 973,514 732,362 Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology 652,036 879,747 715,407 Chemicals and Polymers 559,166 556,011 653,573 Technology and Manufacturing 464,589 187,432 332,995 Buildings 352,998 349,858 457,488 Infrastructure 288,193 325,029 246,420 Pulp and Paper 58,076 72,350 182,456 Other 76,756 122,962 185,189 $ 4,615,601 $ 4,555,661 $ 3,956,993 Other includes projects for clients operating in a number of industries including food and consumer products, and basic resources (such as mining, minerals, and fertilizers). Page 22 Table of Contents Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002 We recorded net earnings of $128.0 million, or $2.27 per diluted share for fiscal year ended September 30, 2003, compared to net earnings of $109.7 million, or $1.98 per diluted share for fiscal 2002. Total revenues for fiscal 2003 increased by $59.9 million, or 1.3%, to $4.6 billion compared to fiscal 2002. Our revenues were relatively flat during the current fiscal year primarily attributable to a $152.4 million, or 9.9% decline in pass through costs. The amount of pass through costs included in revenues during fiscal 2003 totaled $1.4 billion compared to $1.5 billion during fiscal 2002. The level of pass through costs included in revenues and costs will vary between reporting periods depending principally on the amount of procurement that clients choose to do themselves as opposed to using our services as well as on the normal winding down of field services activities on construction and O&M projects. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of pass through costs. As a percentage of revenues, direct costs of contracts were 86.4% for fiscal 2003 compared to 87.2% for fiscal 2002. The percentage relationship between direct costs of contracts and revenues will fluctuate between reporting periods depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business during the reporting periods being compared as well as the level of margins earned from the various types of services provided. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for fiscal 2003 increased by $17.5 million, or 4.2%, to $428.8 million, compared to $411.3 million for fiscal 2002. The increase in SG&A expenses included the impact of the operations of McDermott Engineers & Constructors (Canada) Limited (including Delta Catalytic and Delta Hudson Engineering; collectively Delta) for a full twelve months in the current fiscal year compared to only eleven months in fiscal 2002, since we completed the acquisition of Delta on October 31, 2001. Had Deltas operations been included for a full twelve months for fiscal 2002, SG&A expenses would have been higher by an additional $0.9 million. As a percentage of revenues, consolidated SG&A expenses increased to 9.3% in fiscal 2003 compared to 9.0% in fiscal 2002. Management continues efforts to tighten controls over discretionary spending. Despite a relatively flat revenue stream during fiscal 2003, our operating profit (defined as revenues, less direct costs of contracts and SG&A expenses) increased by $24.7 million, or 14.4%, to $197.1 million, compared to $172.4 million during fiscal 2002. As a percentage of revenues, operating profit increased to 4.3% in fiscal 2003, compared to 3.8% in fiscal 2002. The increase in our operating profit was due primarily to improved margins. Interest expense decreased by $4.2 million, or 56.6%, to $3.3 million in fiscal 2003, compared to $7.5 million in fiscal 2002 due to significantly reduced borrowing levels. In August 2003 we entered into a new, five year $290.0 million unsecured revolving bank credit agreement and terminated the existing revolving credit facilities that had an aggregate borrowing capacity of $275.0 million. The previous facilities that were replaced were scheduled to expire in January 2004. Amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facilities totaled $17.8 million bearing interest of 2.9% at September 30, 2003, compared to $85.7 million bearing interest of 3.8% at September 30, 2002. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our borrowings. We recorded income tax expense of $68.9 million and $59.1 million in fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively. Our overall effective tax rate was 35.0% for both fiscal 2003 and 2002. Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001 On April 1, 2002, we completed a two for one stock split which was distributed in the form of a 100% stock dividend to stockholders of record on March 1, 2002. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the stock split transaction. Page 23 Table of Contents On October 31, 2001, we completed the acquisition of Delta. As more fully explained in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Delta provides engineering, construction, and maintenance services to clients in a variety of industries, with significant revenues attributable to clients in the upstream oil and gas, petroleum refining, energy and other industries. During fiscal 2001, we completed the purchase from LawGibb Group Inc. of substantially all of its international engineering and construction management business (the GIBB businesses), and finalized the second phase of the two part transaction to acquire from Stork N.V., the Netherlands certain engineering and contracting businesses (Stork Phase II). See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the Stork and GIBB transactions. Our operating results for fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 were not significantly impacted by the operations of GIBB and Stock Phase II. We recorded net earnings of $109.7 million, or $1.98 per diluted share, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002, compared to net earnings of $87.8 million, or $1.61 per diluted share for fiscal 2001. Effective October 1, 2001, we eliminated the amortization of goodwill in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Our results of operations for prior years have not been restated. Goodwill amortization on a pre tax basis was $7.6 million ($4.9 million after tax) in fiscal 2001. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of SFAS 142. Total revenues for fiscal 2002 increased by $598.7 million, or 15.1%, to $4.6 billion, compared to total revenues of $4.0 billion in fiscal 2001. Approximately 12.4%, or $564.1 million of revenues in fiscal 2002 were generated by Deltas operations. SG&A expenses for fiscal 2002 increased by $50.5 million, or 14.0%, to $411.3 million, compared to $360.8 million for fiscal 2001. The increase in SG&A expenses during fiscal 2002 reflects the inclusion of the operations of Delta, GIBB and Stork Phase II, which contributed a combined total of $40.2 million to SG&A expenses. Excluding the impact of the Delta and GIBB acquisitions, and the impact of eliminating goodwill amortization in fiscal 2002, SG&A expenses increased by $31.6 million, or 9.3%, in fiscal 2002. As a percentage of revenues, consolidated SG&A expenses was 9.0% in fiscal 2002, compared to 9.1% in fiscal 2001. During fiscal 2002, our operating profit increased by $28.5 million, or 19.8%, to $172.4 million, compared to $143.9 million in fiscal 2001. The increase in our operating profit for fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was due primarily to increases in business volume, combined with the elimination of goodwill amortization, and with keeping direct costs of contracts and SG&A expenses as percentages of revenues at approximately the same levels as fiscal 2001. Operating profit was 3.8% of revenues in fiscal 2002, compared to 3.6% of revenues in fiscal 2001. Excluding the impact of goodwill amortization, our operating profit would have been 3.8% of revenues in fiscal 2001. During fiscal 2002, interest expense decreased by $4.2 million, or 36.0%, to $7.5 million, compared to interest expense of $11.7 million during fiscal 2001. The decrease in interest expense was due to significantly reduced borrowing levels. At September 30, 2002, we had total debt of $91.7 million, compared to $184.0 million at September 30, 2001. We financed the Delta acquisition in October 2001 with a new, short term $50.0 million credit facility. By September 2002, we had converted this credit facility to a long term, $45.0 million facility due in January 2004. At September 30, 2002, this long term facility had an outstanding balance of $28.1 million bearing interest of 3.4%. At September 30, 2002 and 2001, outstanding borrowings (and the associated interest rates) under the $230.0 million revolving credit facility were $57.6 million (bearing interest of 4.0%), and $164.3 million (bearing interest of 4.1%), respectively. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our borrowings. Page 24 Table of Contents We recorded income tax expense of $59.1 million and $50.4 million in fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively. Our overall effective tax rate was 35.0% for fiscal 2002, compared to an effective tax rate of 36.5% for fiscal 2001. Backlog Backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us. Our policy with respect to O&M contracts, however, is to include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for one succeeding year, regardless of the remaining life of the contract. For federal programs (other than federal O&M contracts), our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award, whether funded or unfunded, and exclude option periods. In accordance with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the option of the client. However, we have not experienced cancellations that have had a material effect on the reported backlog amounts. In a situation where a client terminates a contract, we would ordinarily be entitled to receive payment for work performed up to the date of termination and, in certain instances, we may be entitled to allowable termination and cancellation costs. While management uses all information available to it to determine backlog, our backlog at any given time is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein. The following table summarizes our total backlog at September 30, 2003, 2002 and 2001 (in millions): 2003 2002 2001 Technical professional services $ 3,383.2 $ 3,045.6 $ 2,490.1 Total 7,041.0 6,674.2 5,912.5 In fiscal 2002, we began classifying as field services backlog, certain engineering and scientific and systems consulting activities relating to operations and maintenance contracts that had been classified previously as technical professional services backlog. Backlog for fiscal years 2001 has been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2002 presentation. Total backlog at September 30, 2003 included approximately $1.9 billion, or 27.7% of total backlog, relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the U.S. federal government and its agencies. This compares to approximately $1.8 billion (or 27.6%) and $1.9 billion (or 32.4%) of U.S. federal backlog at September 30, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Most of our federal contracts extend beyond one year. In general, these contracts must be funded annually (i.e., the amounts to be spent under the contract must be appropriated by Congress to the procuring agency, and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts). Our backlog for fiscal 2003 increased by $366.8 million, or 5.5%, to $7.0 billion, compared to fiscal 2002, and increased in fiscal 2002 by $761.7 million, or 12.9%, to $6.7 billion, compared to fiscal 2001. The increase in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 was attributable primarily to new awards from clients in the oil & gas, and refining industries, combined with new U.S. federal program awards. The increase in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 was also attributable primarily to oil & gas, and refining backlog added as a result of the Delta acquisition. Also contributing to the increase in backlog from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 were new awards in both the civil and infrastructure, and the U.S. federal programs sectors of our business. We estimate that approximately $2.9 billion, or 41.5% of total backlog at September 30, 2003 will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year. Page 25 Table of Contents Effects of Inflation During fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001, approximately 82%, 85%, and 81%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues were realized from cost reimbursable type contracts. Because a significant portion of our revenues continues to be earned under cost reimbursable type contracts, the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations continue to be generally low. However, as we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixed price and lump sum work is more prevalent, inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future. To the extent permitted by competition, we intend to continue to emphasize contracts which are either cost reimbursable or negotiated fixed price. For contracts with fixed price and lump sum terms, we closely monitor the actual costs on the project as compared to the original estimates. On these projects, we also attempt to secure fixed price commitments from key subcontractors and vendors. However, due to the competitive nature of our business, combined with the fluctuating demands and prices associated with personnel, equipment and materials we traditionally need in order to perform on our contracts, there can be no guarantee that inflation will not affect our results of operations in the future. Liquidity and Capital Resources We finance our operations primarily through cash provided by operations. At September 30, 2003, our principal source of liquidity consisted of $126.2 million of cash and cash equivalents, and a new, five year $290.0 million revolving credit facility discussed below. During fiscal 2003, our cash and cash equivalents increased by $77.7 million, to $126.2 million. This compares to a net decrease of $0.8 million, to $48.5 million during fiscal 2002, and to a net decrease of $16.6 million, to $49.3 million during fiscal 2001. During fiscal 2003, we experienced net cash inflows from operating activities, and the effect on cash of exchange rate changes of $147.5 million and $2.8 million, respectively. These inflows were offset by net cash outflows from investing and financing activities of $17.7 million and $55.0 million, respectively. Our operations provided net cash of $147.5 million during fiscal 2003. This compares to net cash inflows of $160.8 million and $15.1 million during fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively. The $13.2 million decrease in cash provided by operations in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 was due primarily to a decrease in inflows of $39.1 million relating to the timing of cash receipts and payments within our working capital accounts, partially offset by an increase in net earnings of $18.3 million, and an increase in inflows relating to deferred income taxes of $6.7 million. In determining the amount we fund our defined benefit pension plans, we consider various factors including the minimum amounts required under applicable law, the tax deductibility of any contribution we make, and the effect of the funding on the future returns on plan assets. Although management continues to evaluate and monitor our future funding options and requirements, we expect the funding amounts to range from approximately $6.1 million in fiscal 2004 to $13.3 million in fiscal 2006. The net cash we used for investing activities was $17.7 million during fiscal 2003. This compares to net cash outflows of $92.5 million and $63.6 million during fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively. The net decrease of $74.9 million in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 was due primarily to a decrease of $43.5 million in net cash used for acquisitions, a net decrease in other noncurrent assets of $21.0 million, a decrease in additions to property and equipment of $11.4 million, and an increase of $3.9 million in proceeds from sales of investments. These inflows were partially offset by an increase of $2.9 million in purchases of investments, and a decrease in disposals of property and equipment of $2.1 million. Our financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $55.0 million during fiscal 2003. This compares to net cash outflows of $64.7 million and net cash inflows of $32.2 million during fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively. The $9.7 million net decrease in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 was due primarily to decreases in repayments of long term Page 26 Table of Contents borrowings and purchases of common stock for treasury of $364.2 million and $2.0 million, respectively, and an increase of $6.2 million in proceeds from issuance of common stock. These inflows were partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from long term borrowings of $242.7 million, and a net reduction in short term borrowings of $104.8 million. Our total borrowing activity for fiscal 2003 resulted in net repayments of $77.0 million, compared to net repayments of $93.6 million in fiscal 2002, and net additional borrowings of $17.1 million in fiscal 2001. We believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations and service our debt for the foreseeable future. At September 30, 2003, we had $126.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, and a consolidated working capital position of $358.7 million. At September 30, 2002, we had $48.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, and a consolidated working capital position of $234.5 million. On August 20, 2003, we signed a new, five year $290.0 million unsecured revolving bank credit agreement and terminated all existing revolving credit facilities. The previous revolving credit facilities had an aggregate borrowing capacity of $275.0 million and were scheduled to expire in January 2004. Management believes that the capacity, terms and conditions of the new facility will be sufficient for the Companys working capital and general business requirements. We also have $46.1 million available through committed short term credit facilities. At September 30, 2003, $0.5 million and $17.8 million were outstanding in the form of direct borrowings under the $46.1 million and $290.0 credit facilities, respectively. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our borrowings. Under our stock repurchase program, we are authorized by our Board of Directors to buy back up to 6.0 million shares of the common stock of the Company in the open market. Repurchases of common stock are financed from existing credit facilities and available cash balances. From inception of the program through September 30, 2002, we have repurchased a total of 3,732,400 shares of common stock in the open market at a total cost of $59.0 million. No shares of common stock were repurchased during fiscal 2003. Substantially all shares of common stock held in treasury were eventually reissued for our employee stock purchase and incentive stock plans. New Accounting Pronouncements In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 45 Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN 45). FIN 45 requires that, upon issuance of a guarantee, the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee. In addition, FIN 45 requires additional disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of FIN 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002, and the disclosure requirements of FIN 45 are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. We adopted the disclosure requirements of FIN 45 in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure (SFAS 148). SFAS 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to fair value based accounting for stock based compensation. SFAS also amends the disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS 123) by requiring disclosures in both interim and annual financial statements. As allowed by SFAS 123, we have elected to continue to account for stock issued to our employees and outside directors in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25). We adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS 123 as amended by SFAS 148 in the second quarter of fiscal 2003. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN46), which is an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 Consolidated Page 27 Table of Contents Financial Statements (ARB 51). FIN 46 requires a variable interest entity (VIE) to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if certain criteria are met. The provisions of FIN 46 were immediately applicable to VIEs created after January 31, 2003. In October 2003, the FASB deferred the effective date of FIN 46 for VIEs created before February 1, 2003 to the first reporting period ending after December 15, 2003. As is common to the industry, we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through partnerships and joint ventures. In general, we account for these investments in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 00 01 Investor Balance Sheet and Income Statement Display under the Equity Method for Investments in Certain Partnerships and Other Ventures (EITF 00 01) and AICPAs Statement of Position 81 1 Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts (SOP 81 1). We are a partner in two joint ventures which may require consolidation in accordance with FIN 46. The first joint venture provides engineering, design, construction, and construction management services in connection with the upgrade and rehabilitation of a municipal wastewater treatment plant. At September 30, 2003, this joint venture had total assets and total liabilities of $27.0 million and $21.6 million, respectively. The second joint venture performs capital projects and provides operations services, testing, analysis and support services to a U.S. military engineering and design center. The contract between this second joint venture and the U.S. federal government was not executed until October 2003 and, accordingly, the assets and liabilities of this second joint venture were not material at September 30, 2003. Although we continue to evaluate the applicability of FIN 46 to our joint ventures, we believe that most of our joint ventures are either not VIEs or, if the joint ventures are VIEs, we are not the primary beneficiary. On April 30, 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 149 Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 149). SFAS 149 clarifies and amends financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under Statement of Accounting Standards No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133). SFAS 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified, and for hedging relationships designated, after June 30, 2003. We do not believe that the adoption of SFAS 149 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. On May 15, 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150 Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity (SFAS 150). SFAS 150 establishes standards for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity and that have been presented either entirely as equity or between the liabilities section and the equity section of the balance sheet. SFAS 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003. SFAS 150 does not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. Forward Looking Statements Statements included in this Managements Discussion and Analysis that are not based on historical facts are forward looking statements, as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are based on managements current estimates, expectations and projections about the issues discussed, the industries in which our clients operate and the services we provides. By their nature, such forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. We have tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements by using words such as anticipate, estimate, expect, project, intend, plan, believe and words and terms of similar substance in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. We caution the reader that a variety of factors could cause business conditions and results to differ materially from what is contained in our forward looking statements including the following: Increase in competition by U.S. and international competitors; Changes in global business, economic, political and social conditions; Page 28 Table of Contents Availability of qualified engineers, architects, designers and other home office staff needed to execute contracts; Availability of qualified craft personnel in the geographic areas where our construction and maintenance sites are located; The timing of new awards and the funding of such awards; Cancellations of, or changes in the scope to, existing contracts; Our ability to meet performance or schedule guarantees; Cost overruns on fixed price, guaranteed maximum price, or unit priced contracts; The possible effects of inflation on margins available on fixed price contracts; The effects that fluctuating exchange rates may have on the U.S. dollar results of our international operations; The outcome of pending and future litigation and any government audits, investigations, or proceedings; The cyclical nature of the individual markets in which our clients operate; and Delays or defaults by clients in making payments due under contracts. The preceding list is not all inclusive, and we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Readers of this Managements Discussion and Analysis should also read our most recent Annual Report on Form 10 K for a further description of our business, legal proceedings and other information that describes factors that could cause actual results to differ from such forward looking statements. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading, speculation or other purposes that would expose the Company to market risk. In the normal course of business, our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. Interest Rate Risk Our only source for long term credit is a revolving credit agreement for $290.0 million. The total amounts outstanding under this facility at September 30, 2003 was $17.9 million. This agreement expires in August of 2008, and provides for both fixed rate and variable rate borrowings. Our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows, and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain fixed rate debt on a majority of our borrowings and minimize our outstanding borrowings by paying down debt from cash provided from operations. Foreign Currency Risk In general, our exposure to fluctuating exchange rates relates to the effects of translating the financial statements of our subsidiaries operating outside the United States, which are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, into the U.S. dollar. We follow the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52 Foreign Currency Translation in preparing our consolidated financial statements. We believe our exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies may have on our consolidated results of operations is limited because, in general, our various operations invoice Page 29 Table of Contents customers and satisfy their financial obligations in their respective local currencies. In situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their own functional currencies, we strive to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs.
