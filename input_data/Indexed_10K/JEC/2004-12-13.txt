Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The purpose of this Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is to provide an overview of the Companys financial condition and results of operations as well as an analysis of the factors that caused certain key elements of our financial statements to change from one year to the next. In this discussion, we may make statements that are not based on historical fact. All such statements are forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although such statements are based on managements current estimates and expectations, and currently available competitive, financial, and economic data, forward looking statements are inherently uncertain, and we caution the reader that a variety of factors could cause business conditions and results to differ materially from what is contained in our forward looking statements. A list of some of the factors most likely to occur that could cause actual results to differ from our forward looking statements is presented at the end of this MD&A. In this MD&A, we use certain terms and abbreviations that are defined as follows: APB Accounting Principles Board Backlog Backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us. Our policy with respect to O&M contracts, however, is to include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for one succeeding year, regardless of the remaining life of the contract. For federal programs (other than federal O&M contracts), our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award, whether funded or unfunded, and exclude option periods. Gross margin From the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, gross margin means revenues, less direct costs of contracts. Operating profit From the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, operating profit means revenues, less direct costs of contracts and SG&A expenses. SFAS Statement of Financial Accounting Standards; an accounting standard adopted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). SG&A expenses From the Consolidated Statements of Earnings; SG&A expenses means selling, general and administrative expenses. Overview Our operating results for fiscal 2004 reflected growth in earnings that was below managements expectations. During the third quarter of fiscal 2004, we had several projects where our work was either suspended or delayed, and one project that was cancelled entirely. Although changes in the timing of when work required by large projects commences is not unusual, the magnitude of the delays and cancellation that occurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2004 had a significant impact on our results of operations for both the third and fourth fiscal quarters. These delays and cancellations contributed to a decline in revenues, and hindered our ability to absorb the increase in our SG&A expenses. Also contributing to the decrease in revenues during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 was a decline in pass through costs. When we are responsible for subcontract labor or third party materials and equipment, we reflect the costs of such items in both revenues and costs. Since pass through costs (which are incurred primarily on projects requiring field services) typically do not have Page 21 Table of Contents significant margins, we can experience a decline in revenues without experiencing a corresponding decline in our gross margins and operating profit. The increase in the technical and professional services component of our revenues, relative to pass through costs, was the chief reason for the improved gross margins for fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003. Gross margins increased by $38.8 million, or 6.2%, during fiscal 2004 as compared to last year. However, due to increased G&A spending in support of higher home office services, our operating profit percentage remained at 4.3% of revenues for fiscal 2004; the same percentage as fiscal 2003. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we completed the acquisition of the Babtie Group for a total cash purchase price of &pound;92.0 million (approximately $169.3 million). Headquartered in Scotland, the Babtie Group is a leading provider of technical and professional services to clients in the infrastructure, facilities, environmental, defense, and governmental outsourcing markets, among others. Although the Babtie Group employs approximately 3,500 people and generates approximately $300.0 million of revenues annually, the effect of the acquisition on our fiscal 2004 results of operations was not material. Because (i) the entire value of contracts is added to backlog as soon as the contracts are awarded to us (rather than adding the contracts to backlog gradually over time), and (ii) many of our contracts require us to provide services that span over a number of fiscal quarters (and sometimes over fiscal years), we evaluate our backlog on a year over year basis, rather than on a sequential, quarter over quarter basis. Our backlog at September 30, 2004 increased by $411.5 million, or 5.8%, to $7.5 billion from $7.0 billion at September 30, 2003. The increase in backlog during fiscal 2004 was attributable primarily to the addition of the Babtie Group, combined with new awards from clients within the oil & gas and refining industries, and the U.S. federal program area of our business. Backlog at September 30, 2004 reflects the project cancellation discussed above. In addition, approximately $150.0 million of procurement backlog was removed during the third quarter of fiscal 2004, as well as approximately $160.0 million of backlog relating to public sector work when it was determined that we would not receive the full value of the contract award. Our cash balances remained strong during fiscal 2004. In spite of the cash used to acquire the Babtie Group and an increase in acquisitions of property and equipment, cash and cash equivalents totaled $100.1 million at September 30, 2004 compared to $126.2 million at September 30, 2003. Our cash balances, combined with a borrowing capacity of $290.0 million under our long term, unsecured revolving credit facility, present sufficient capital resources for us to fund our on going operations. Additions to property and equipment totaled $37.1 million during fiscal 2004. This was $11.3 million, or 43.8%, higher than the amount spent during fiscal 2003. Contributing to the increase was certain initiatives to expand office space in several of our larger offices in the United States and United Kingdom. Critical Accounting Policies In order to better understand changes that may occur to key elements of our financial condition and operating results, a reader of this MD&A should understand the critical accounting policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements. The Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements, and the financial statements of any business entity performing long term engineering and construction type contracts, requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect both the entitys results of operations as well as the carrying values of its assets and liabilities. Although our significant accounting polices are described in Note 2 of the Notes to Page 22 Table of Contents Consolidated Financial Statements, the following discussion is intended to describe those accounting policies most critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Accounting for Contracts and Use of Joint Ventures In accounting for long term engineering and construction type contracts, we follow the provisions of the AICPAs Statement of Position 81 1 Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts. In general, we recognize revenues at the time we provide services. Depending on the commercial terms of the contract, we recognize revenues either when costs are incurred, or using the percentage of completion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion. This method of revenue recognition requires us to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress. In making such estimates, judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule, the cost of materials and labor, and productivity; and the impact of change orders, liability claims, contract disputes, and achievement of contractual performance standards. Many of our engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fixed or percentage fee. In some of the markets we serve there is an increasing trend towards cost reimbursable contracts with incentive fee arrangements. In certain instances, we base our incentive fees on achievement of target completion dates, target costs, and or other performance criteria. Failure to meet these targets or increases in contract costs can result in unrealized incentive fees or non recoverable costs, which could exceed revenues recognized from the project. One such contract is with the U.S. Department of Energy for the Fernald Closure Project. This contract provides for incentive fees based on schedule and cost. In addition, the terms of the contract stipulate that the incentive fees may not be fully billed to the DOE until the completion of the project, currently estimated to occur in 2007. At September 30, 2004 we had recognized $25.8 million of deferred fees relating to this contract. We provide for contract losses in their entirety in the period they become known, without regard to the percentage of completion. The nature of our business results in clients, subcontractors or vendors occasionally presenting claims against us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur, or for which they believe they are not contractually responsible. Similarly, and in the normal course of business, we may present claims to our clients for costs we have incurred for which we believe we are not contractually responsible. In those situations where a claim against us may result in additional costs to the contract, we would include in the total estimated costs of the contract (and therefore, the estimated amount of margin to be earned under the contract) an estimate, based on the relevant facts and circumstances available, of the additional costs to be incurred. In those situations where we have incurred additional costs for which we believe the client is contractually responsible, we may present a claim to the client for such costs. In such situations, we include in revenues the amount of costs incurred, without profit, to the extent it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue, and the amount of such additional revenue can be reliably estimated. Costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in revenues using substantially the same criteria used for claims. Certain cost reimbursable contracts with government customers as well as certain commercial clients provide that contract costs are subject to audit and adjustment. In this situation, revenues are recorded at the time services are performed based upon the amounts we expect to realize upon completion of the contracts. In those situations where an audit indicates that we may have billed a client for costs not allowable under the terms of the contract, we estimate the amount of such nonbillable costs and adjust our revenues accordingly. As is common in the industry, we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures. For certain of these joint ventures (i.e., where we have an undivided interest in the assets and liabilities of the venture), we recognize our proportionate share of joint venture Page 23 Table of Contents revenues, costs and operating profit in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. For other investments in engineering and construction joint ventures, we use the equity method of accounting. Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees We account for stock based employee compensation using the intrinsic value method, in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Accordingly, on the date a stock option is granted to an employee, we measure compensation cost based on the excess, if any, of the market price of the Companys common stock over the exercise price of the awarded option. In accordance with current accounting standards, we compute a pro forma expense amount for stock options issued, and we disclose this pro forma expense amount in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model to compute the pro forma expense amount. The Black Scholes model, however, was developed for use in estimating the value of publicly traded options that have no vesting restrictions and which are fully transferable. In addition, the Black Scholes model requires the use of assumptions in order to compute the hypothetical, fair value of an option. Changes in these assumptions can cause drastically different values being assigned to a stock option. Accordingly, we caution the readers of our consolidated financial statements that the results of applying the Black Scholes model are not necessarily a reliable measure of the true fair value of stock options granted to employees. Accounting for Pension Plans In accounting for pension plans, we follow the provisions of SFAS No. 87 Employers Accounting for Pensions. SFAS 87 requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost, and the value of the plans assets and liabilities. These assumptions involve discount rates, investment returns, and projected salary increases, among others. We rely on qualified actuaries to assist us in valuing the financial position of the plans, and to provide advice regarding the actuarial assumptions used. During fiscal 2004, we lowered slightly our expected rate of return on plan assets from a range of 8.0% to 9.0% in fiscal 2003 to a range of 6.0% to 9.0% in fiscal 2004. We believe this reduction better reflects the long term returns expected on the plans assets, considering projected rates of inflation, the diversification of the plans assets, and the expected real rates of market returns. Changes in the actuarial assumptions may have a material affect on the plans assets and liabilities, and the associated pension expense. Management, together with our actuaries, monitors trends in the marketplace within which our pension plans operate in order to assure the fairness of the actuarial assumptions used. In connection with the fiscal 2001 acquisition of certain engineering and contracting businesses from Stork N.V., we are negotiating the value of certain plan assets and prior service obligations that may be transferred from a multiemployer pension plan into a new, single employer pension plan we formed during fiscal 2004 for the benefit of our employees in the Netherlands. If such a transfer were to occur presently, we believe the value of the assets we would receive would be less than the value of the prior service pension obligations we would assume. Included in Other Deferred Liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2004 is approximately $42.3 million for the prior service obligations relating to the multiemployer pension plan in the Netherlands. Accounting for Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the normal course of our business, we may engage in numerous transactions every day for which the ultimate tax outcome (including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in taxable income or deducted as an expense) is uncertain. Additionally, we file income, franchise, gross receipts and similar tax returns in many jurisdictions. Our tax returns are subject to audit and investigation by the Internal Revenue Service, most states in the United States, and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the United States. Although our effective tax rate has been 35% during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, we continually monitor the Page 24 Table of Contents appropriateness of the rate, and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will differ from our estimates. Insurance Matters, Litigation, Claims, and Contingencies In the normal course of business, we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation. Generally, such guarantees relate to project schedules and plant performance. Most of the litigation in which we are concerned involves the Company as a defendant in workers compensation, personal injury, environmental, environmental exposure, professional liability, and other similar lawsuits. We maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations. However, we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles, limits, and retentions under our insurance programs. This situation may subject us to some future liability for which we are only partially insured, or completely uninsured. In addition, as a contractor providing services to various agencies of the United States federal government, we are subject to many levels of audits, investigations, and claims by, or on behalf of, the U.S. federal government with respect to contract performance, pricing, costs, cost allocations, and procurement practices. In accordance with SFAS No. 5 Accounting for Contingencies, we record in our Consolidated Balance Sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such claims, guarantees, litigation, and audits and investigations. We rely on qualified actuaries to assist us in determining the level of reserves to establish for both insurance related claims that are known and have been asserted against us as well as for insurance related claims that are believed to have been incurred based on actuarial analysis, but have not yet been reported to our claims administrators as of the respective balance sheet dates. We include any adjustments to such insurance reserves in our consolidated results of operations. Testing Goodwill for Impairment In accordance with SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), the amount of goodwill carried in our Consolidated Balance Sheets is tested annually for possible impairment. In conducting the impairment test, we may apply, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142, various techniques to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. These techniques are inherently subjective and the resulting values are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of our reporting units to a willing third party. Since the adoption of SFAS 142 in fiscal 2002, we have not recorded any impairment loss associated with our goodwill. Operations Outside the United States In general, our principal exposure to fluctuating exchange rates relates to the effects of translating the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries, which are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, into the U.S. dollar. We follow the provisions of SFAS No. 52 Foreign Currency Translation in preparing our consolidated financial statements. We believe our exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies may have on our consolidated results of operations is limited because our various operations invoice clients and satisfy their financial obligations primarily in their respective local functional currencies. In situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currencies, we strive to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs. Results of Operations General Our business focuses exclusively on providing technical, professional, and construction services to a large number of industrial, commercial, and governmental clients around the world. The services we provide generally fall into four broad categories: project services (which includes engineering, design, architectural, and similar services); Page 25 Table of Contents construction services (which includes revenues earned from traditional field construction activities as well as modular construction activities); operations and maintenance (O&M) services (which includes revenues from contracts requiring us to operate and maintain large, complex facilities on behalf of clients as well as contracts involving process plant maintenance services and activities); and process, scientific, and systems consulting services (which includes revenues earned from providing a wide variety of scientific and consulting services to clients). The scope of services we can provide our clients, therefore, ranges from consulting and conceptual design services (which are often required by clients in the very early stages of a project) to complete, single responsibility, design build operate contracts. The following table sets forth our revenues by type of service for each year ended September 30 (in thousands): 2004 2003 2002 Project Services $ 2,060,288 $ 1,894,777 $ 1,977,173 Construction 1,581,023 1,751,875 1,775,562 Operations and Maintenance 704,206 743,094 626,559 Process, Scientific and Systems Consulting 248,718 225,855 176,367 $ 4,594,235 $ 4,615,601 $ 4,555,661 Beginning with the second quarter of fiscal 2002, we classify certain elements of revenues as Construction that were classified previously as Project Services. In Addition, certain amounts for fiscal 2002 and 2003 have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2004 presentation. We focus our services on certain industry groups and markets that we believe have sufficient common needs to permit cross utilization of our resources. The following table sets forth our revenues by these industry groups and markets for each year ended September 30 (in thousands): 2004 2003 2002 Oil & Gas and Refining $ 1,270,468 $ 1,093,047 $ 1,088,758 Federal Programs 1,051,016 1,070,740 973,514 Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology 713,566 652,036 879,747 Chemicals and Polymers 559,733 559,166 556,011 Technology and Manufacturing 203,579 464,589 187,432 Buildings 354,742 352,998 349,858 Infrastructure 304,977 288,193 325,029 Pulp and Paper 42,339 58,076 72,350 Other 93,815 76,756 122,962 $ 4,594,235 $ 4,615,601 $ 4,555,661 Other includes projects for clients operating in a number of industries including food and consumer products, and basic resources (such as mining, minerals, and fertilizers). Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003 We recorded net earnings of $129.0 million, or $2.25 per diluted share, for fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, compared to net earnings of $128.0 million, or $2.27 per diluted share for fiscal 2003. Page 26 Table of Contents Total revenues for fiscal 2004 remained relatively unchanged from fiscal 2003 at $4.6 billion. The amount of pass through costs included in revenues in fiscal 2004 declined by approximately $223.6 million, or 16.1%, as compared to fiscal 2003. The level of pass through costs included in revenues and costs will vary between reporting periods depending principally on the amount of procurement that clients choose to do themselves as opposed to using our services as well as on the normal winding down of field services activities on construction and O&M projects. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of pass through costs. Off setting this decline in field services activity in part was approximately $54.0 million of revenues of the Babtie Group, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. The Babtie Group is a leading provider of technical and professional services to clients in the infrastructure, facilities, environmental, defense, and governmental outsourcing markets, among others. As a percentage of revenues, direct costs of contracts were 85.5% for fiscal 2004 compared to 86.4% for fiscal 2003. The percentage relationship between direct costs of contracts and revenues will fluctuate between reporting periods depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business during the reporting periods being compared as well as the level of margins earned from the various types of services provided. In general, the percentage improvement in this performance indicator from fiscal 2003 to 2004 was due primarily to a higher portion of our total revenues being derived from technical professional services versus field services. SG&A expenses for fiscal 2004 increased by $37.6 million, or 8.8%, to $466.4 million, compared to $428.8 million for fiscal 2003. Included in SG&A expenses for fiscal 2004 is approximately $13.5 million of SG&A expenses from the Babtie Group. The balance of the increase was due primarily to the effects of foreign currency translation, and higher spending in support of our professional technical services activities. Operating profit for fiscal 2004 totaled $198.3 million; relatively unchanged from the fiscal 2003 amount of $197.1 million. As a percentage of revenues, operating profit was 4.3% for both fiscal 2004 and 2003. Interest income increased by $1.7 million to $3.1 million for fiscal 2004, compared to $1.4 million for fiscal 2003. The increase in interest income was due primarily to higher cash balances on deposit during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003. Interest expense increased by $0.3 million, or 9.6%, to $3.6 million for fiscal 2004, compared to $3.3 million for fiscal 2003. The increase in interest expense was due primarily to slightly higher borrowings under our long term, revolving credit facility. We recorded income tax expense of $69.4 million and $68.9 million for fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. Our overall effective tax rate was 35.0% for both fiscal years. In the normal course of our business, we may engage in numerous transactions every day for which the ultimate tax outcome (including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in taxable income or deducted as an expense) is uncertain. Additionally, we file income, franchise, gross receipts and similar tax returns in many jurisdictions. Our tax returns are subject to audit and investigation by the Internal Revenue Service, most states in the United States, and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the United States. Although our effective tax rate has been 35% for fiscal 2004 and 2003, we continually monitor the appropriateness of the rate, and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will differ from our estimates. Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002 We recorded net earnings of $128.0 million, or $2.27 per diluted share for fiscal year ended September 30, 2003, compared to net earnings of $109.7 million, or $1.98 per diluted share for fiscal 2002. Page 27 Table of Contents Total revenues for fiscal 2003 increased by $59.9 million, or 1.3%, to $4.6 billion compared to fiscal 2002. Our revenues were relatively flat during the current fiscal year primarily attributable to a $152.4 million, or 9.9% decline in pass through costs. The amount of pass through costs included in revenues during fiscal 2003 totaled $1.4 billion compared to $1.5 billion during fiscal 2002. As a percentage of revenues, direct costs of contracts were 86.4% for fiscal 2003 compared to 87.2% for fiscal 2002. The percentage relationship between direct costs of contracts and revenues will fluctuate between reporting periods depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business during the reporting periods being compared as well as the level of margins earned from the various types of services provided. SG&A expenses for fiscal 2003 increased by $17.5 million, or 4.2%, to $428.8 million, compared to $411.3 million for fiscal 2002. The increase in SG&A expenses included the impact of the operations of McDermott Engineers & Constructors (Canada) Limited (including Delta Catalytic and Delta Hudson Engineering; collectively Delta) for a full twelve months in the current fiscal year compared to only eleven months in fiscal 2002, since we completed the acquisition of Delta on October 31, 2001. Had Deltas operations been included for a full twelve months for fiscal 2002, SG&A expenses would have been higher by an additional $0.9 million. As a percentage of revenues, consolidated SG&A expenses increased to 9.3% in fiscal 2003 compared to 9.0% in fiscal 2002. Management continues efforts to tighten controls over discretionary spending. Despite a relatively flat revenue stream during fiscal 2003, our operating profit increased by $24.7 million, or 14.4%, to $197.1 million, compared to $172.4 million during fiscal 2002. As a percentage of revenues, operating profit increased to 4.3% in fiscal 2003, compared to 3.8% in fiscal 2002. The increase in our operating profit was due primarily to improved margins. Interest expense decreased by $4.2 million, or 56.6%, to $3.3 million in fiscal 2003, compared to $7.5 million in fiscal 2002 due to significantly reduced borrowing levels. In August 2003 we entered into a new, five year $290.0 million unsecured revolving bank credit agreement and terminated the existing revolving credit facilities that had an aggregate borrowing capacity of $275.0 million. The previous facilities that were replaced were scheduled to expire in January 2004. Amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facilities totaled $17.8 million bearing interest of 2.9% at September 30, 2003, compared to $85.7 million bearing interest of 3.8% at September 30, 2002. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our borrowings. We recorded income tax expense of $68.9 million and $59.1 million in fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively. Our overall effective tax rate was 35.0% for both fiscal 2003 and 2002. Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth certain information about our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2004 (in thousands): Payments Due by Fiscal Period Total Less than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5Years Bank debt $ 80,015 $ 1,257 $ $ 78,758 $ Operating leases 337,429 69,597 113,297 78,654 75,881 Obligations under defined benefit pension plans (a) 186,961 26,400 56,010 60,581 43,970 Obligations under nonqualified deferred compensation plans (b) 54,620 5,942 12,607 13,635 22,436 Purchase obligations (c) 481,100 481,100 Total $ 1,140,125 $ 584,296 $ 181,914 $ 231,628 $ 142,287 Page 28 Table of Contents (a) Assumes that future contributions will be consistent with amounts projected to be contributed in fiscal 2005, allowing for certain growth based on rates of inflation and salary increases, but limited to the amount recorded as of September 30, 2004. Actual contributions will depend on a variety of factors, including amounts required by local laws and regulations, and other funding requirements. (b) Assumes that future payments will be consistent with amounts paid in fiscal 2004, allowing for certain growth. Due to the nonqualified nature of the plans, and the fact that benefits are based in part on years of service, the payments included in the schedule was limited to the amount recorded as of September 30, 2004. (c) Represents those liabilities estimated to be under firm contractual commitments as of September 30, 2004. Backlog The following table summarizes our total backlog at September 30, 2003, 2002 and 2001 (in millions): 2004 2003 2002 Technical professional services $ 3,989.0 $ 3,383.2 $ 3,045.6 Total 7,452.5 7,041.0 6,674.2 In accordance with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the option of the client. However, we have not experienced cancellations that have had a material effect on the reported backlog amounts. In a situation where a client terminates a contract, we would ordinarily be entitled to receive payment for work performed up to the date of termination and, in certain instances, we may be entitled to allowable termination and cancellation costs. While management uses all information available to it to determine backlog, our backlog at any given time is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein. In fiscal 2002 we began classifying as field services backlog certain engineering and scientific and systems consulting activities relating to operations and maintenance contracts that had been classified previously as technical professional services backlog. Backlog for fiscal years 2001 has been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2002 presentation. Total backlog at September 30, 2004 included approximately $2.3 billion (or 30.2%) of total backlog, relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the U.S. federal government and its agencies. This compares to approximately $1.9 billion (or 27.7%) and $1.8 billion (or 27.6%) of U.S. federal backlog at September 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Most of our federal contracts extend beyond one year. In general, these contracts must be funded annually (i.e., the amounts to be spent under the contract must be appropriated by the U.S. Congress to the procuring agency, and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts). Our backlog for fiscal 2004 increased by $411.5 million, or 5.8%, to $7.5 billion, compared to fiscal 2003, and increased in fiscal 2003 by $366.8 million, or 5.5%, to $7.0 billion, compared to fiscal 2002. The increase in backlog during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 was attributable primarily to the addition of the Babtie Group, combined with new awards from clients within the oil & gas and refining industries; and the U.S. federal program area of our business. The increase in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 was attributable primarily to new awards from clients in the oil & gas and refining industries combined with new U.S. federal program awards. Page 29 Table of Contents We estimate that approximately $3.7 billion or 49.2% of total backlog at September 30, 2004 will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year. Effects of Inflation During fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002, approximately 83%, 82%, and 85%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues were realized from cost reimbursable type contracts. Because a significant portion of our revenues continues to be earned under cost reimbursable type contracts, the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations continue to be generally low. However, as we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixed price and lump sum work is more prevalent, inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future. To the extent permitted by competition, we intend to continue to emphasize contracts which are either cost reimbursable or negotiated fixed price. For contracts with fixed price and lump sum terms, we closely monitor the actual costs on the project as compared to the original estimates. On these projects, we also attempt to secure fixed price commitments from key subcontractors and vendors. However, due to the competitive nature of our business, combined with the fluctuating demands and prices associated with personnel, equipment and materials we traditionally need in order to perform on our contracts, there can be no guarantee that inflation will not affect our results of operations in the future. Liquidity and Capital Resources We finance our operations primarily through cash provided by operations. At September 30, 2004, our principal source of liquidity consisted of $100.1 million of cash and cash equivalents, and $211.2 million of available capacity under our $290.0 million revolving credit facility discussed below. During fiscal 2004, our cash and cash equivalents decreased by $26.1 million, to $100.1 million. This compares to a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of $77.7 million, to $126.2 million, during fiscal 2003, and to a net decrease of $0.8 million, to $48.5 million, during fiscal 2002. During fiscal 2004, we experienced net cash inflows from operating activities, and financing activities of $87.8 million and $91.4 million, respectively. These inflows were offset by net cash outflows from investing activities and the effect of exchange rate changes of $203.1 million and $2.1 million, respectively. Our operations provided net cash of $87.8 million during fiscal 2004. This compares to net cash inflows of $147.5 million and $160.8 million during fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively. The $59.8 million decrease in cash provided by operations in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 was due primarily to a decrease of $38.1 million relating to the timing of cash receipts and payments within our working capital accounts. Also contributing to the decline in cash flows from operations was the effects of a $14.0 million change in deferred income taxes, and a $7.5 million increase in gains from the sales of assets (the cash flows associated with which are shown in the investing section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows). The net cash we used for investing activities was $203.1 million during fiscal 2004. This compares to net cash outflows of $17.7 million and $92.5 million during fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively. The net increase of $185.4 million in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 was due primarily to an increase of $163.8 million in cash used for acquisitions. Also contributing to the increase in cash used for investing activities was a $11.3 million increase in additions to property and equipment; a $10.7 million increase in investments and other non current assets; and a $4.1 decrease in cash proceeds from the sales of investments. Off setting these increases in part was a $4.5 million increase in proceeds from sales of property and equipment. Our financing activities resulted in net cash inflows of $91.4 million during fiscal 2004. This compares to net cash outflows of $55.0 million and $64.7 million during fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively. The $146.3 million increase in cash flows from financing activities during fiscal 2004 as Page 30 Table of Contents compared to fiscal 2003 was due primarily to a $54.7 million increase in borrowings, net of repayments, under our long term credit facilities, combined with a $77.4 million reduction during fiscal 2004 of cash used to pay off short term indebtedness. We believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations and service our debt for the foreseeable future. We had $100.1 million in cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2004, compared to $126.2 million at September 30, 2003. Our consolidated working capital position at September 30, 2004 was $397.6 million, compared to $358.7 million at September 30, 2003. We have a long term, unsecured revolving credit facility providing up to $290.0 million of debt capacity, under which only $78.0 million was utilized at September 30, 2004 in the form of direct borrowings. We believe that the capacity, terms and conditions of our long term revolving credit facility is adequate for our working capital and general business requirements, as well as the working capital needs associated with the acquisition of the Babtie Group. We also had, at September 30, 2004, $38.6 million of borrowing capacity available to us through committed, short term credit facilities. Under our stock repurchase program, we are authorized by our Board of Directors to buy back up to 6.0 million shares of the common stock of the Company in the open market. Repurchases of common stock are financed from existing credit facilities and available cash balances. From inception of the program through September 30, 2004, we have repurchased a total of 3,732,400 shares of common stock in the open market at a total cost of $59.0 million. No shares of common stock were repurchased during fiscal 2004 and 2003. Substantially all shares of common stock held in treasury were eventually reissued for our employee stock purchase and incentive stock plans. Factors That May Affect Forward Looking Statements As mentioned above, there are a variety of factors that could cause business conditions and results to differ materially from the forward looking statements contained in this MD&A, including, in no particular order, the following: Increase in competition by United States and international competitors; Changes in global business, economic, political, and social condition; Availability of qualified engineers, architects, designers and other home office staff needed to execute contracts; Availability of qualified craft personnel in the geographic areas where our construction and maintenance sites are located; The timing of new awards and the funding of such awards; Delays, cancellations, or suspensions of, or changes in the scope to, existing contracts; Our ability to meet performance or schedule guarantees; Cost overruns on fixed price, guaranteed maximum price, or unit priced contracts; The possible effects of inflation on margins available on fixed price contracts; The effects that fluctuating exchange rates may have on the U.S. dollar results of our international operations; Page 31 Table of Contents The outcome of pending and future claims, litigation, and any government audits, investigations or proceedings; The cyclical nature of the individual markets in which our clients operate; Delays or defaults by clients in making payments due under contracts; The successful integration of recent and future acquisitions; The effect on future earnings due to any change in the way stock options are required to be accounted for. The preceding list is not all inclusive, and we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Readers of this Managements Discussion and Analysis should also read our most recent Annual Report on Form 10 K for a further description of our business, legal proceedings and other information that describes factors that could cause actual results to differ from such forward looking statements. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading, speculation or other purposes that would expose the Company to market risk. In the normal course of business, our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates. Interest Rate Risk Our only source for long term credit is a $290.0 million syndicated revolving credit facility. The total amount outstanding under this facility at September 30, 2004 was $78.8 million. This agreement expires in August of 2008, and provides for both fixed rate and variable rate borrowings. Our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows, and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain fixed rate debt on a majority of our borrowings and minimize our outstanding borrowings by paying down debt from cash provided from operations. Foreign Currency Risk In general, our exposure to fluctuating exchange rates relates to the effects of translating the financial statements of our subsidiaries operating outside the United States, which are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, into the U.S. dollar. We follow the provisions of SFAS No. 52 Foreign Currency Translation in preparing our consolidated financial statements. We believe our exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies may have on our consolidated results of operations is limited because, in general, our various operations invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations in their respective local currencies. In situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their own functional currencies, we strive to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs. In connection with the acquisition of the Babtie Group, we entered into a forward contract with a large, U.S. bank in the notional amount of &pound;39.9 million (approximately $73.4 million). The purpose of the contract was to hedge the Companys foreign currency exchange exposure on a &pound;39.9 million intercompany loan between Jacobs and one of its subsidiaries. Regardless of the degree to which the value of British Sterling may decline against the U.S. Dollar, the maximum potential effect on our future earnings will be limited to $5.0 million. The forward contract qualifies as a cash flow hedge under the provisions SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Page 32 Table of Contents
