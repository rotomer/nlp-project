ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This Annual Report on Form 10 K (Report), including the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward looking statements regarding future events and the future results of the Company that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the industry in which the Company operates and the beliefs and assumptions of the management of the Company. Words such as expects, anticipates, targets, goals, projects, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. These forward looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this Report under the section entitled Risk Factors and elsewhere, and in other reports the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), specifically the most recent reports on Form 10 Q, each as it may be amended from time to time. The Company undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason. The following discussion is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingencies. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to sales returns, warranty costs, allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long term assets, especially goodwill and intangible assets, contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges, and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Overview of the Business Juniper Networks, Inc. (Juniper Networks or we) was founded in 1996 to develop and sell products that would be able to meet the stringent demands of service providers. Today, we are a leading provider of network infrastructure solutions that transform the business of networking. Our products enable customers to improve their business models by providing more differentiation and value to end users as well as increased reliability and security, thereby making the network a more valuable asset. We sell and market our products through our direct sales organization and value added resellers. Overview of the Results of Operations 14 Table of Contents To aid in understanding our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, we believe an overview of the significant events that occurred during those years and a discussion of the nature of the expenses is helpful. Significant Events As a result of an economic slowdown beginning in 2001 and going into 2003, many telecommunication service providers cut back capital expenditure and discretionary spending budgets. These cut backs contributed to the decrease in our revenues beginning in late 2001 and through 2002. To help combat the financial impact of the reduction in revenue, we undertook a series of initiatives. The first initiative was a restructuring in 2001 to better align our operations with the then current market and service provider industry conditions. This restructuring initiative included a worldwide workforce reduction, consolidation of excess facilities and restructuring of certain business functions. In July 2002, we completed our acquisition of Unisphere Networks, Inc. (Unisphere), a subsidiary of Siemens Corporation, which is a subsidiary of Siemens A.G. (Siemens). Unisphere developed, manufactured and sold data networking equipment optimized for applications at the edge of service provider networks. The acquisition enabled us to expand our customer base and add a complementary product to our existing product line without any need to reorganize or modify our existing organizational or cost structure. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 141, Business Combinations, we have included in our results of operations for 2002 the results of Unisphere from July 1, 2002. The Unisphere acquisition impacted revenue, cost of revenues and all operating expenses for the second half of 2002. The results for 2003 include a full year of results of the combined companies. In connection with the acquisition of Unisphere, we initiated plans to eliminate certain duplicative activities, focus on strategic product and customer bases, reduce cost structure and better align product and operating expenses with existing general economic conditions. In 2003, we announced that we were no longer developing our G series CMTS products and recorded a one time charge that was comprised of workforce reduction costs, non inventory asset impairment, the costs associated with vacating facilities and terminating contracts and other related costs. We expect this action to facilitate the focus on core competencies and reduce cost structure. During the second calendar quarter of 2003, we issued $400.0 million of Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2008. Also during 2003, we paid $792.0 million to retire a portion of the 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes due March 15, 2007. These transactions had an effect on our cash, cash equivalents, investments, interest income and interest expense. Nature of Expenses Most of our manufacturing, repair and supply chain management operations are outsourced to independent contract manufacturers; accordingly, most of our cost of revenues consists of payments to our independent contract manufacturers. The independent contract manufacturers manufacture our products using quality assurance programs and standards that we establish. Controls around manufacturing, engineering and documentation are conducted at our facilities in Sunnyvale, California and Westford, Massachusetts. Our independent contract manufacturers have facilities in Neenah, Wisconsin and Toronto, Canada. Generally, our contract manufacturers retain title to the underlying components and finished goods inventory until our customers take title to the assembled final product upon shipment from the contract manufacturers facility. We realized savings in carrying and obsolete material charges from 2001 to 2002 and through 2003. The contract manufacturers procure components based on our build forecasts and if actual component usage is significantly lower than our forecasts, 15 Table of Contents we may be, and have been in the past, liable for carrying or obsolete material charges. During 2001, there was a large expense related to carrying and obsolete material due to the change in the global economy and the sudden decrease in product revenues. During the first half of 2002, the global economy continued to have an adverse effect on our revenues; however, it began to improve during the second half. In addition, as part of the Unisphere acquisition, we consolidated our outsourced contract manufacturing operations from three to two, and incurred additional carrying and obsolete material charges. Carrying and obsolete charges decreased during 2003 as the global economy and our product revenue continued to improve. The primary component of our operating expenses historically has been employee related costs, which includes items such as wages, commissions, bonuses, vacation, benefits and travel. In addition, the facility and information technology departmental costs are allocated to other departments based on headcount. Following are descriptions of the unique expense items in each operating expense class. We expense our research and development costs as they are incurred. Research and development expenses include the costs of developing our products from components to prototypes to finished products, outside services for such services as certifications of new products, equipment used for testing and patent related costs. Several components of our research and development effort require significant expenditures, such as the development of new components and the purchase of prototype equipment, the timing of which can cause quarterly variability in our expenses. Sales and marketing expenses include costs for promoting our products and services, demonstration equipment and advertisements. These costs can vary quarter to quarter depending on revenues, product launches and marketing initiatives. In addition to employee related expenses, general and administrative expenses include professional fees, bad debt provisions and other corporate expenses. Professional fees include legal, audit, tax, accounting and corporate strategic services. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to establish accounting policies that contain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These policies include: revenue recognition; the allowance for doubtful accounts, which impacts general and administrative expenses; the valuation of exposures associated with the contract manufacturing operations and estimating future warranty costs, both of which impact cost of product revenues and gross margins; and the provision of income taxes, which would impact our income tax expense. We have other important accounting policies and practices. However, once adopted, these other policies either generally do not require us to make significant estimates or assumptions or otherwise only require implementation of the adopted policy and not a judgment as to the policy itself. We base our estimates on our historical experience and also on assumptions that we believe are standard and reasonable. Despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and assumptions, actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue Recognition We recognize product revenue when persuasive 16 Table of Contents evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured, unless we have future obligations for such things as network interoperability or customer acceptance, in which case revenue and related costs are deferred until those obligations are met. In most cases, we recognize product revenue upon shipment to our customers, including resellers, as it is our policy to ensure an end user has been identified prior to shipment. Service revenue is recognized as the services are completed or ratably over the service period. Beginning July 1, 2003, we recognized revenue on arrangements where products and services were bundled in accordance with EITF 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. In applying the concepts of EITF 00 21, we must determine whether the deliverables are separable into multiple units of accounting. We allocate the total fee on such arrangements to the individual deliverables either based on their relative fair values or using the residual method, as circumstances dictate. We then recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with our policies for product and service revenue recognition. The application of EITF 00 21 includes judgments whether the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis and whether we have established objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items. Our ability to recognize revenue in the future may be affected if actual selling prices are significantly less than the fair values. In addition, our ability to recognize revenue in the future will be impacted by conditions imposed by our customers and by our assessment of collectibility. We assess the probability of collection by reviewing our customers payment history, financial condition and credit report. If the probability of collection is not reasonably assured, revenue is deferred until the payment is collected. The amount of product revenue recognized in a given period is also impacted by our judgments made in establishing our reserve for potential future product returns. Although our arrangements do not include any contractual rights of return, and our general policy is that we do not accept returns, under unique circumstances we have and may in the future accept product returns from our customers. Therefore, we do provide a reserve for our estimate of future returns against revenue in the period the revenue is recorded. Our estimate of future returns is based on such factors as historical return data and current economic condition of our customer base. In addition, we get input from our sales and support organizations on potential product returns relating to specific customer issues. The amount of revenue we recognize will be directly impacted by our estimates made to establish the reserve for potential future product returns. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable in our calculation of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In determining the amount of the allowance, we make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations and assess current economic trends affecting our customers that might impact the level of credit losses in the future and result in different rates of bad debts than previously seen. We also consider our historical level of credit losses. Our reserves historically have been adequate to cover our actual credit losses. If actual credit losses were to be significantly greater than the reserves we have established, our general and administrative expenses would increase. Conversely, if actual credit losses were to be significantly less than our reserves, our general and administrative expenses would decrease. Contract Manufacturer Exposures We outsource most of our manufacturing, repair and supply chain management operations to our independent contract manufacturers. Accordingly, a significant portion of the cost of revenues consists of payments to them. Our independent contract manufacturers procure components and manufacture products based on our build forecasts. These forecasts are based on our estimates of future demand for our products. These estimates are based on historical trends and an analysis from our sales and marketing organizations, adjusted for overall market conditions. If the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast, we have contractual liabilities and exposures with the independent contract manufacturers, such as carrying costs and obsolete material exposures, that would have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability. Demand for our products and component usage are largely affected by factors that are outside of our control. Warranty Reserves We generally offer a one year warranty on all of our hardware products as well as a 90 day warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the products. The warranty generally includes parts, labor and 24 hour service center support. On occasion, the specific terms and conditions of those 17 Table of Contents warranties vary. We record a liability based on estimates of the costs that may be incurred under our warranty obligations and charge to cost of product sales the amount of such costs at the time revenue is recognized. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units, our estimates of anticipated rates of warranty claims and costs per claim. Our estimates of anticipated rates of warranty claims and costs per claim are primarily based on historical information and future forecasts. We periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. If actual warranty claims are significantly higher than forecast, or if the actual costs incurred to provide the warranty is greater than the forecast, our gross margins could be adversely affected. Provision for Income Taxes Estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards. We regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income based on the realization criteria set forth under SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe to be more likely than not realizable. Accordingly, a valuation allowance in an amount equal to the net deferred tax assets has been established to reflect uncertainty regarding future realization of these assets, in part, due to the potential impact of future stock option deductions. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities may result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimate of tax liabilities is less than the amount ultimately assessed, a further charge to expense would result. Results of Operations Net Revenues The following table shows product and service net revenues in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Net revenues: Product $ 602,455 86 % $ 467,651 86 % $ 830,899 94 % Service 98,938 14 % 78,896 14 % 56,123 6 % Total net revenues $ 701,393 100 % $ 546,547 100 % $ 887,022 100 % Our net revenues for each of the last three years have primarily changed as a result of the changes in the global economy, which caused fluctuations in our customers capital expenditure budgets. Beginning in mid 2001, the overall global economy deteriorated and most of our customers reduced their capital expenditure budgets. We began to see these factors improve in 2003, as was evidenced by the change in chassis revenue units and ports shipped, as summarized in the table below. 2003 2002 2001 Chassis revenue units 4,785 3,517 4,519 Ports shipped 73,471 54,897 54,894 Our platforms are essentially modular, with the chassis serving as the base of the platform. Each chassis has a certain number of slots that are available to be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces. The modules are the components through which the router receives incoming packets of data from a variety of transmission media. The physical connection between a transmission medium and a module is referred to as a port. The number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the functionality and throughput offered by the module. 18 Table of Contents Chassis revenue units represent the number of chassis on which revenue was recognized during the period. Chassis revenue units and ports shipped are tracked to analyze customer trends and are used as indicators for potential network growth. The increase in product net revenues in 2003 compared to 2002 was due primarily to an increase in the demand for our products resulting from our customers expanding their networks for new applications and users, partially offset by a shift in product mix to less expensive products. We did not experience any unusual pricing pressure in 2003 compared to 2002. The decrease in product net revenues in 2002 compared to 2001 was due primarily to a decrease in the demand for our products that resulted from the generally unfavorable economic conditions throughout 2002 and a shift in product mix to less expensive products. Service net revenues increased each of the last two years as a result of a larger installed base of customers and products. A majority of service revenue is from customers who previously purchased our products and enter into a service contract. In addition to service contracts, service revenue is generated from providing professional and educational services. Service contracts are typically for one year renewable periods and revenue is recognized ratably over the service period. Two customers individually accounted for 15% and 13% of total net revenues in 2003. For 2002, one customer accounted for 17% of net product revenues, compared to 2001, where one customer accounted for 14%, a second customer accounted for 13% and a third customer accounted for 11% of net product revenues. Management began including service revenue in its calculation of significant customers in the second half of 2002. The following table shows net revenue by geographic region (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Americas $ 296,151 42 % $ 300,022 55 % $ 613,819 69 % Europe, Middle East and Africa 186,436 27 % 131,139 24 % 171,639 19 % Asia Pacific 218,806 31 % 115,386 21 % 101,564 12 % Total $ 701,393 $ 546,547 $ 887,022 We experienced a shift in net revenues as a percentage of total net revenues from the Americas region to Europe and Asia during the last two years as the capital spending market in the United States declined at a greater rate than the international market. We expect the split among the Americas and international regions to remain relatively consistent during 2004. Cost of Revenues The following table shows cost of product and service revenues and the related gross margin (GM) percentages for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2003 GM% 2002 GM% 2001 GM% Cost of revenues: Product $ 200,621 67 % $ 179,721 62 % $ 318,968 62 % Service 56,728 43 % 50,387 36 % 53,803 4 % Total cost of revenues $ 257,349 63 % $ 230,108 58 % $ 372,771 58 % The increase in product gross margins from 2002 to 2003 was primarily due to savings in outsourced manufacturing costs as a result of improved efficiencies and cost cutting initiatives at our contract manufacturers. The increase in product gross margins was also due to a 62% decrease in carrying and obsolete material charges from 2002 to 2003. In addition, 2002 included a one time charge of $5.1 million related to the Unisphere acquisition for backlog orders and an inventory write up adjustment. 19 Table of Contents Product gross margins were flat at 62% for 2002 and 2001 as a result of operational costs being cut as the demand for our products decreased. The decrease in absolute dollars for cost of product revenue from 2001 to 2002 was directly related to the decrease in product revenue, which was primarily a result of unfavorable economic conditions many customers experienced throughout 2002, as well as to a 37% decrease in carrying and obsolete material charges. Service gross margins increased from 2002 to 2003 as a result of the 25% increase in service revenue as compared to only a 13% increase in cost of service revenues. We were able to grow service revenue at a faster rate than cost of service revenues due to improved efficiencies and economies of scale that were a direct result of a larger install base, and thus a more leveraged service organization. This increased leverage is evidenced by the fact that total employee related expenses decreased as a percentage of service revenue from 29% for 2002 to 27% for 2003, however, in absolute dollars employee related expenses increased slightly. In addition, in absolute dollars, the costs associated with spare parts increased by 39% year over year. Service gross margins increased from 2001 to 2002 primarily due to a larger installed base of customers and products combined with realized savings in our service organization for personnel and other related costs associated with our restructuring activities. Research and Development, Sales and Marketing and General and Administrative Expenses The following table shows research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Research and development $ 176,104 25 % $ 161,891 30 % $ 155,530 18 % Sales and marketing $ 145,784 21 % $ 126,803 23 % $ 140,407 16 % General and administrative $ 28,462 4 % $ 34,263 6 % $ 37,554 4 % Research and development expenses increased $14.2 million in 2003 compared to 2002, but decreased as a percent of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to a 16% increase in employee related expenses as a result of a full year of operations after the acquisition of Unisphere. In addition, we stopped paying bonuses in 2002 as part of our overall corporate cost cutting initiatives; however, we started to accrue employee bonuses in the second half of 2003 as our financial results improved. Offsetting the increase in employee related expenses was a 35% decrease in consulting and contractor services due to our overall corporate cost cutting initiatives and a 28% decrease in prototype expenses. Prototype expenses are closely tied to product launches because of the testing and certification needed before a product can be offered to the public, and the amounts can vary depending on the product being developed. Research and development expenses increased $6.4 million and as a percent of total net revenues in 2002 compared to 2001. The increases were primarily a result of a 50% increase in headcount related expenses, a 48% increase in the use of consulting and contractor services, partially offset by 63% savings in prototype equipment. Headcount related expenses and consulting and contractor services increased primarily due to the Unisphere acquisition. Prototype equipment expenses were higher during 2001 because we were preparing for the release of our high end T series products, as well as certain M series and J series products, and developing and testing a new family of application specific integrated circuits (ASICs). We expect to continue to devote resources to the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products. We believe that research and development is critical to our strategic product development objectives and that to leverage our leading technology and meet the changing requirements of our customers, we will need to fund investments in several development projects in parallel. 20 Table of Contents Sales and marketing expenses increased $19.0 million in 2003 compared to 2002, but decreased as a percent of total net revenues. The majority of the increase in absolute dollars was a 32% increase in employee related expenses in the sales organization as a result of additional headcount and commissions, resulting from the increase in revenue. In addition, customer facing expenses such as marketing events and customer programs increased 40%. Offsetting the increases was a decrease of 41% for demonstration equipment, which is expensed immediately and is closely tied to product launches. To date, we have not incurred significant advertising expenses. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $13.6 million in 2002 compared to 2001, but increased as a percent of net revenues. The decrease in absolute dollars was a result of a 63% decrease in costs related to employee and partner events, a 23% reduction in the use of demonstration equipment, and consolidation of excess facilities, all of which are attributable to our cost cutting initiatives. We intend to continue to focus and expand our sales and marketing efforts across all the geographies and markets we serve in order to increase market awareness of our products and to better support our existing customers worldwide. We believe that continued investment in sales and marketing is critical to our success. General and administrative expenses decreased $5.8 million and as a percent of total net revenues in 2003 compared to 2002. The majority of the decrease was due to a 91% reduction in bad debt expense in 2003 compared to 2002. This reduction was a result of greater than expected collection efforts and the absence of any significant customer bankruptcies. The decrease in bad debt expense was partially offset by a 22% increase in professional services related to certain strategic consulting activities. General and administrative expenses decreased $3.3 million in 2002 compared to 2001, but increased as a percent of total net revenues. The decrease was due to a 15% savings in employee related expenses and a 12% decrease in the use of outside services, both of which are attributable to our cost cutting initiatives. Other Operating Expenses The following table shows other operating expenses in absolute dollars for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Restructuring and other $ 13,985 $ 20,229 $ 12,340 Amortization of purchased intangibles and deferred stock compensation $ 22,698 $ 14,304 $ 76,768 In process research and development $ $ 83,479 $ 4,200 Integration $ $ 2,507 $ Amortization of goodwill $ $ $ 46,589 Restructuring and Other In the third quarter of 2003, we announced that we are no longer developing our G series CMTS products and recorded a one time charge of approximately $14.0 million that was comprised of workforce reduction costs, non inventory asset impairment, vacating facilities costs, the costs associated with termination of contracts and other related costs. Our Board of Directors approved the restructuring charge and expects that the plan will facilitate the focus on core competencies and reduce our cost structure. The following table shows the breakdown of the restructuring charge and the liability remaining as of December 31, 2003 (in thousands): Remaining liability as of Non cash Cash December 31, Initial charge charges payments 2003 Workforce reduction $ 5,550 $ (744 ) $ (3,520 ) $ 1,286 Asset impairment 2,887 (2,887 ) Facilities 3,455 (288 ) 3,167 21 Table of Contents Remaining liability as of Non cash Cash December 31, Initial charge charges payments 2003 Other contractual commitments and other charges 2,093 (1,385 ) 708 Total $ 13,985 $ (3,631 ) $ (5,193 ) $ 5,161 The workforce reduction related primarily to the termination of 76 employees that were mainly located in the Americas and Europe regions. We expect to pay the remaining balance of the severance accrual by the end of the first quarter of 2004. Non inventory asset impairment was primarily for long lived assets that were no longer needed as a result of our decision to cease further development of the product line. Facility charges consist primarily of the cost of vacating facilities that were dedicated to the development of the G series CMTS products and the impairment cost of certain leasehold improvements. The net present value of the facility charge was calculated using our risk adjusted borrowing rate. Amounts related to the net facility charge will be paid over the respective lease term through July 2008. The difference between the actual future rent payments and the net present value will be recorded as operating expenses when incurred. Other contractual commitments and other charges consist primarily of $0.9 million of carrying and obsolete material charges from our contract manufacturers and suppliers for on hand and on order material related to the G series CMTS products and $0.9 million of costs to satisfy end of life commitments in certain customer contracts. All of these costs were included as a charge to the results of operations in the quarter ended September 30, 2003. Changes to the estimates of executing the currently approved plans of restructuring will be reflected in results of operations. During the third quarter of 2002, in connection with the acquisition of Unisphere, we recorded restructuring expenses of approximately $14.9 million, associated primarily with workforce related costs, costs of vacating duplicative facilities, contract termination costs, non inventory asset impairment charges and other associated costs, net of a $2.6 million adjustment due to a change in estimate. As of December 31, 2003, there was $3.1 million remaining to be paid, entirely related to facility costs to be paid through April 2009. We also recognized a charge of approximately $5.3 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2002 related to the land acquired in January 2001 located in Sunnyvale, California. The charge was primarily for costs of exiting certain contractual obligations associated with the land. We currently have no plans to continue developing the land in the foreseeable future. In June 2001, we announced a restructuring program that included a worldwide workforce reduction, consolidation of excess facilities and restructuring of certain business functions. As of December 31, 2003, there was $0.2 million remaining to be paid, entirely related to facility costs to be paid through August 2006. Amortization of Purchased Intangibles and Deferred Stock Compensation We amortize purchased intangible assets and deferred stock compensation over their estimated lives. The following table shows the breakdown of the amortization expenses (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Amortization of purchased intangibles $ 20,661 $ 13,896 $ 2,688 Amortization of deferred stock compensation 2,037 408 74,080 Amortization of purchased intangibles and deferred stock compensation $ 22,698 $ 14,304 $ 76,768 The amortization expense of intangible assets increased $6.8 million in 2003 compared to 2002 due to the intangible assets purchased in the Unisphere acquisition in July 2002. The amortization expense of intangible assets increased $11.2 million in 2002 compared to 2001 due to the intangible assets purchased in the Unisphere acquisition in July 2002 and a full year of amortization of the intangible assets purchased in the Pacific Broadband Communications (Pacific Broadband) acquisition in December 2001. The amortization expense of deferred stock compensation was $2.0 million in 2003, which included a credit, as required by APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issue to Employees, (APB 25) of approximately $5.6 million due to employees who forfeited options for which compensation expense had been recognized on the 22 Table of Contents graded vesting method, but which were unvested on the date their employment was terminated. A majority of these employees were a part of the restructuring plan in 2003. The amortization expense of deferred stock compensation was $0.4 million and $74.1 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The primary reason for the decrease was a reversal, as required by APB 25, of $33.5 million in previously recognized stock compensation expense. This reversal related to the difference between the expense that had been previously recognized under the graded vesting method for former employees and the expense that would have been recorded using the straight line method. Finally, the decrease in expense is also a result of using the graded vesting method, which expenses a larger percent in the earlier months. In Process Research and Development In July 2002, we completed the acquisition of Unisphere, a subsidiary of Siemens. Following the acquisition and during the remainder of 2002, Siemens was one of our significant resellers. The acquisition resulted in the payment of $375.0 million cash and the issuance of 36.5 million shares of our common stock with a fair value of approximately $359.9 million to the former stockholders of Unisphere. We recorded goodwill of $769.9 million, purchased intangible assets of $74.0 million, in process research and development (IPRD) of $82.7 million and deferred compensation on unvested stock options of $0.5 million. The intangibles assets, other than goodwill, are being amortized over their respective useful lives, which we determined to be between two and six years. In December 2001, we acquired Pacific Broadband and accounted for the acquisition under the purchase method of accounting. We allocated $4.2 million of the $148.3 million purchase price as in process research and development. We also originally recorded goodwill of $127.3 million and other intangible assets of $10.2 million. The intangibles assets have been completely amortized as of December 31, 2003. Integration We incurred integration expenses of approximately $2.5 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2002 resulting from our acquisition of Unisphere. Integration expenses are one time incremental costs directly related to the integration of the two companies that have no go forward benefit. The integration expenses consisted principally of workforce related expenses for individuals transitioning their positions and professional fees. Amortization of Goodwill There was no amortization of goodwill in 2003 and 2002 in accordance with SFAS 142. Amortization of goodwill was $46.6 million in 2001 from the Micro Magic, Inc. acquisition, which occurred in 2000. Other Income and Expenses The following table shows other income and expenses for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Interest and other income $ 33,428 $ 56,404 $ 94,747 Interest and other expense $ (39,099 ) $ (55,605 ) $ (61,377 ) Gain (loss) on retirement of convertible subordinated notes, net $ (1,085 ) $ 62,855 $ Gain on sale of investments $ 8,739 $ $ Write down of investments $ $ (50,451 ) $ (53,620 ) Equity in net loss of joint venture $ $ (1,316 ) $ (4,076 ) Interest and other income decreased $23.0 million in 2003 compared to 2002. The decrease was the result of lower cash and investment balances throughout 2003 as we spent $792.0 million to retire a portion of our 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes Due March 15, 2007 (the Subordinated Notes), 23 Table of Contents partially offset by the $392.8 million in net proceeds received from the issuance of the Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2008 (the Senior Notes). In addition, interest rates were lower in 2003 as compared to 2002. Interest and other income decreased $38.3 million in 2002 compared to 2001. The decrease was the result of lower cash and investment balances throughout 2002 as we spent $146.0 million to retire a portion of the Subordinated Notes and $375.8 million in the Unisphere acquisition. In addition, interest rates were lower in 2002 as compared to 2001. Interest and other expenses decreased $16.5 million in 2003 compared to 2002 and $5.8 million in 2002 compared to 2001, almost entirely due to interest saved from the partial retirement of the Subordinated Notes during each of the last two years. During 2003, we paid $792.0 million to retire and redeem a portion of the Subordinated Notes. These Subordinated Notes had a cost basis of $800.0 million. The retirement resulted in a gain of $14.1 million and the redemption resulted in a loss of $15.2 million, both of which was the difference between the carrying value of the Subordinated Notes at the time of their retirement, including unamortized debt issuance costs, and the amount paid to extinguish such notes. In the quarter ended September 30, 2002, we paid approximately $146.0 million to retire a portion of the Subordinated Notes. This partial retirement resulted in a gain of approximately $62.9 million, which was the difference between the carrying value of the Subordinated Notes at the time of their retirement, including unamortized debt issuance costs, and the amount paid to extinguish such notes. During the first and second quarters of 2003, we sold some of our marketable equity securities classified as available for sale, which had a cost basis of $4.3 million, and recognized gains of $8.7 million. We have certain minority equity investments in privately held companies that are carried at cost, adjusted for any impairment, as we own less than 20% of the voting equity and do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over these companies. We wrote down these investments $50.5 million and $53.6 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively, for changes in market value that we believed were other than temporary. There were no such write downs in 2003. Equity in net loss of joint venture decreased $2.8 million in 2002 compared with 2001. During the quarter ended June 30, 2001, we entered into a joint venture agreement with Ericsson A.B., through our respective subsidiaries, to develop and market products for the wireless Internet infrastructure market. In addition to this joint venture, Ericsson is also one of our significant resellers, representing greater than 10% of our revenues in 2003, 2002 and 2001. As of December 31, 2002, we had no further obligations to fund this joint venture. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes increased to $19.8 million in 2003 from $4.5 million in 2002. The 2003 effective rate was 33.6% and reflects taxes payable in certain foreign jurisdictions, the benefit of research credits and capital loss carryforwards and the inability to benefit certain charges and losses. Provision for income taxes decreased to $4.5 million in 2002 from $30.0 million in 2001. The effective tax rates for 2002 and 2001 were 3.9% and 181%, respectively. The tax rates for 2002 and 2001 include the effects of write downs in equity investments and acquisition related charges for goodwill and in process research and development, which are non deductible. The IRS is currently auditing the Companys federal income tax returns for fiscal years 1999 and 2000. Proposed adjustments have not been received for these years. Management believes the ultimate outcome of the IRS audits will not have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. 24 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview We have funded our business by issuing securities and through our operating activities. The following table shows our capital resources (in thousands): 2003 2002 Cash and cash equivalents $ 365,606 $ 194,435 Short term investments $ 215,906 $ 384,036 Long term investments $ 394,297 $ 583,664 Restricted cash $ 30,837 $ Working capital $ 399,996 $ 438,905 Working capital decreased from 2002 to 2003 primarily due to the partial retirement of the Subordinated Notes, offset by cash provided by operations and the issuance of common stock through employee stock option exercises and stock purchase plans. The significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, short term investments and accounts receivable, reduced by accounts payable, accrued liabilities and deferred revenue. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, and cash generated from operations will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations through at least the next 12 months. In addition, there are no transactions, arrangements, and other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of our requirements for capital resources. Cash Requirements and Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at December 31, 2003 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands): Less Than 1 3 3 5 More Than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Operating leases, net of committed subleases $ 211,877 $ 26,049 $ 48,116 $ 46,784 $ 90,928 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes Due March 15, 2007 (Subordinated Notes) 142,076 142,076 Interest due on the Subordinated Notes 21,371 6,749 13,497 1,125 Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2008 400,000 400,000 Total contractual principal cash obligations $ 775,324 $ 32,798 $ 61,613 $ 189,985 $ 490,928 As of December 31, 2003, our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under operating leases, the Subordinated Notes and the Senior Notes. The contractual obligations under operating leases are primarily for our facilities. Interest is paid semi annually on March 15 and September 15 for the Subordinated Notes at an annual rate of 4.75%. Anytime we retire a portion of the Subordinated Notes, the interest accrued on that portion is due. The Senior Notes were issued in June 2003 and are senior unsecured obligations, rank on parity in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured debt, and rank senior to all of our existing and future debt that expressly provides that it is subordinated to the notes, including our Subordinated Notes. The Senior Notes bear no interest, but are convertible into shares of our common stock, subject to certain conditions, at any time prior to maturity or their prior repurchase by Juniper Networks. The conversion rate is 49.6512 shares per each $1,000 principal amount of convertible notes, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. 25 Table of Contents We do not have firm purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers. In order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply, the contract manufacturers place non cancelable, non returnable (NCNR) orders based on our build forecasts. As of December 31, 2003, there were NCNR orders valued at $62.5 million. We do not take ownership of the components and the NCNR orders do not represent firm purchase commitments per our agreements with the contract manufacturers. The components are used to build products based on purchase orders we have received from our customers. The liability for products built by the contract manufacturer is recorded once they fulfill our customers order and the order ships. If the components go unused, there may be carrying charges or obsolete charges assessed. As of December 31, 2003, we had accrued $14.6 million for potential exposures with our contract manufacturers, such as carrying and obsolete material charges. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $178.6 million, $2.4 million and $292.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The cash provided by operating activities for all periods was due to our net income in 2003 and net losses in 2002 and 2001 adjusted by ongoing non cash charges such as: depreciation expense; amortization expenses for intangible assets, deferred compensation and debt costs; and normal fluctuations in accounts receivable, prepaid and other current assets, long term assets, accounts payables, accrued liabilities and deferred revenue. Unusual and significant adjustments to the net income for 2003 included: a non cash charge of $3.6 million associated to the impairment of assets included as part of the restructuring in 2003; the net loss of $1.1 million on the retirement of the Subordinated Notes; a non cash tax benefit of $10.8 million related to the exercise of employee stock options; and a gain of $8.7 million from the sale of investments. Unusual and significant adjustments to the net losses in 2002 and 2001 include: non cash charges of $1.7 million and $4.5 million, respectively, related to the restructuring programs during those years; a gain of $62.9 million for the partial retirement of Subordinated Notes in 2002; the non cash write downs of $50.5 million and $53.6 million, respectively, for the impairment of equity investments; in process research and development charges of $83.5 million and $4.2 million, respectively, related to the Unisphere and Pacific Broadband acquisition, respectively; the tax benefit of $25.0 million in 2001 related to the exercise of employee stock options and the $46.6 million amortization of goodwill in 2001. Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities was $300.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 and net cash used in investing activities was $295.5 million and $307.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Recurring investing activities included capital expenditures of $19.4 million, $36.1 million and $241.1 million, respectively. We reduced our capital expenditures over the past two years as part of our overall corporate cost cutting initiatives. We have also made investments in securities classified as available for sale and sold investments to fund ongoing operations, the partial retirement of the Subordinated Notes and the Unisphere acquisition. We have also made minority equity investments of $0.9 million, $1.2 million and $8.2 million, respectively, in privately held companies. Unusual investing activities include (i) an increase of $30.8 million in restricted cash for the establishment of a trust to secure our indemnification obligations to certain directors and officers and the purchase of letters of credit to secure certain facility leases and (ii) $375.8 million paid in 2002 related to the Unisphere acquisition. 26 Table of Contents Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $307.5 million and $119.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities was $58.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. We received proceeds during all three years from the issuance of common stock related to employee option exercises and stock purchase plans. We also received $392.8 million in net proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Notes in 2003 and paid $792.0 million and $146.0 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, to retire a portion of the Subordinated Notes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a revision to Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51 (FIN 46R). FIN 46R clarifies the application of ARB No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support provided by any parties, including the equity holders. FIN 46R requires the consolidation of these entities, known as variable interest entities (VIEs), by the primary beneficiary of the entity. The primary beneficiary is the entity, if any, that will absorb a majority of the entitys expected losses, receive a majority of the entitys expected residual returns, or both. Among other changes, the revisions of FIN 46R (a) clarified some requirements of the original FIN 46, which had been issued in January 2003, (b) eased some implementation problems, and (c) added new scope exceptions. FIN 46R deferred the effective date of the Interpretation for public companies to the end of the first reporting period ending after March 15, 2004, except that all public companies must at a minimum apply the unmodified provisions of the Interpretation to entities that were previously considered special purpose entities in practice and under the FASB literature prior to the issuance of FIN 46R by the end of the first reporting period ending after December 15, 2003. Among the scope exceptions, companies are not required to apply FIN 46R to an entity that meets the criteria to be considered a business as defined in the Interpretation unless one or more of four named conditions exist. FIN 46R applies immediately to a VIE created or acquired after January 31, 2003. We do not have any interests in VIEs. Factors That May Affect Future Results We face intense competition that could reduce our market share and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues. Competition in the network infrastructure market is intense. This market has historically been dominated by Cisco with other companies such as Nortel Networks and Alcatel providing products to a smaller segment of the market. In addition, a number of other small public or private companies have announced plans for new products to address the same challenges that our products address. If we are unable to compete successfully against existing and future competitors from a product offering standpoint or from potential price competition by such competitors, we could experience a loss in market share and or be required to reduce prices, resulting in reduced gross margins, either of which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. The fluctuating economic conditions, combined with the financial condition of some of our customers, make it difficult to predict revenues for a particular period and a shortfall in revenues may harm our operating results. The recent economic downturn generally, and in the telecommunication industry specifically, combined with our own relatively limited operating history in the context of such a downturn, makes it difficult to accurately forecast revenue. 27 Table of Contents We have experienced and expect, in the foreseeable future, to continue to experience limited visibility into our customers spending plans and capital budgets. This limited visibility complicates the revenue forecasting process. Additionally, many customers funded their network infrastructure purchases through a variety of debt and similar instruments and many of these same customers are carrying a significant debt burden and are experiencing reduced cash flow with which to carry the cost of the debt and the corresponding interest charges, which reduces their ability to both justify and make future purchases. The telecommunications industry has experienced consolidation and rationalization of its participants and we expect this trend to continue. There have been adverse changes in the public and private equity and debt markets for telecommunications industry participants, which have affected their ability to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditures. In some cases the significant debt burden carried by these customers has reduced their ability to pay for the purchases made to date. This has contributed, and we expect it to continue to contribute, to the uncertainty of the amounts and timing of capital expenditures, further limiting visibility and complicating the forecasting process. Certain of these customers have filed for bankruptcy as a result of their debt burdens. Although these customers generally expect that they will emerge from the bankruptcy proceedings in the future, a bankruptcy proceeding can be a slow and cumbersome process, further limiting the visibility and complicating the revenue forecasting process as to these customers. Even if they should emerge from such proceedings, the extent and timing of any future purchases of equipment is uncertain. This uncertainty will further complicate the revenue forecasting process. In addition, our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are, and will continue to be, fixed in the short term. If we do not achieve our expected revenues, the operating results will be below our expectations and those of investors and market analysts, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline. A limited numbers of customers comprise a significant portion of our revenues and any decrease in revenue from these customers could have an adverse effect on us. Even though our customer base has increased substantially, we expect that a large portion of our net revenues will continue to depend on sales to a limited number of customers. During 2003, Ericsson and Siemens each accounted for greater than 10% of net revenues. Ericsson was the only customer that accounted for greater than 10% of net revenues during 2002. Any downturn in the business of these customers or potential new customers could significantly decrease sales to such customers that could adversely affect our net revenues and results of operations. We rely on distribution partners to sell our products, and disruptions to these channels could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products. We believe that our future success is dependent upon establishing and maintaining successful relationships with a variety of distribution partners. We have entered into agreements with several value added resellers, some of which also sell products that compete with our products. We cannot be certain that we will be able to retain or attract resellers on a timely basis or at all, or that the resellers will devote adequate resources to selling our products. Any acquisition we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition if we are not able to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies or if expected benefits of the combination do not materialize. We have made and may continue to make acquisitions and investments in order to enhance our business. For example, we recently entered into an agreement to acquire NetScreen Technologies, Inc. in a stock for stock acquisition valued at approximately $4 billion at signing. This transaction, if consummated, will dilute our existing stockholders percentage ownership. In addition, some of our results will be negatively impacted due to certain purchase accounting rules which will result in a write down of NetScreens deferred revenue and other purchase accounting adjustments. Further, the failure to effectively manage the acquisition and integration of NetScreen could disrupt our business and harm our financial results. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including problems combining the purchased operations, technologies or products, unanticipated costs, diversion of managements attention from our core business, adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers, risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we might acquire. 28 Table of Contents The integration of businesses that we have acquired into our business has been and will continue to be a complex, time consuming and expensive process. Failure to operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communication system, operating procedures, financial controls and human resources practices could adversely impact the success of any business combination. For example, although we completed the acquisition of Unisphere Networks on July 1, 2002, integration of the products, product roadmap and operations is a continuing activity and will be for the foreseeable future. As a result of these activities, we may lose opportunities and employees, which could disrupt our business and harm our financial results. We also intend to make investments in complementary companies, products or technologies. In the event of any such investments or acquisitions, we could issue stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership, incur debt, assume liabilities, incur amortization expenses related to purchases of intangible assets, or incur large and immediate write offs. Our products are highly technical and if they contain undetected software or hardware errors, our business could be adversely impacted. Our products are highly technical and are designed to be deployed in very large and complex networks. Certain of our products can only be fully tested when deployed in networks that generate high amounts of IP traffic. As a result, we may experience errors in connection with such products and for new products and enhancements. Any defects or errors in our products discovered in the future could result in loss of or delay in revenue, loss of customers and increased service and warranty cost, any of which could adversely impact our business and our results of operations. If our products do not interoperate with our customers networks, installations will be delayed or cancelled and could harm our business. Our products are designed to interface with our customers existing networks, each of which have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards and products from other vendors. Many of our customers networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved. Our products must interoperate with all of the products within these networks as well as future products in order to meet our customers requirements. If we find errors in the existing software used in our customers networks, we must modify our software to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate and scale with the existing software and hardware. If our products do not interoperate with those of our customers networks, installations could be delayed, orders for our products could be cancelled or our products could be returned. This would also damage our reputation, which could seriously harm our business and prospects. Traditional telecommunications companies generally require more onerous terms and conditions of their vendors. As we seek to sell more products to such customers we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that may have an adverse effect on our business. Traditional telecommunications companies because of their size generally have had greater purchasing power and accordingly have requested and received more favorable terms, which often translate into more onerous terms and conditions for their vendors. As we seek to sell more products to this class of customer, we may be required to agree to such terms and conditions which may include terms that effect our ability to recognize revenue and have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. In addition, many of this class of customer have purchased products from other vendors who promised certain functionality and failed to deliver such functionality and or had products that caused problems and outages in the networks of these customers. As a result, this class of customer may request additional features from us and require substantial penalties for failure to deliver such features or may require substantial penalties for any network outages that may be caused by our products. These 29 Table of Contents additional requests and penalties, if we are required to agree to them, may affect our ability to recognize the revenue from such sales, which may negatively affect our business and our financial condition. If we do not successfully anticipate market needs and develop products and product enhancements that meet those needs, or if those products do not gain market acceptance, we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer. We cannot ensure that we will be able to anticipate future market needs or that we will be able to develop new products or product enhancements to meet such needs or to meet them in a timely manner. If we fail to anticipate the market requirements or to develop new products or product enhancements to meet those needs, such failure could substantially decrease market acceptance and sales of our present and future products, which would significantly harm our business and financial results. Even if we are able to anticipate and develop and commercially introduce new products and enhancements, there can be no assurance that new products or enhancements will achieve widespread market acceptance. Any failure of our future products to achieve market acceptance could adversely affect our business and financial results. Our ability to develop, market and sell products could be harmed if we are unable to retain or hire key personnel. Our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key engineering, sales, marketing and support personnel. None of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term. The loss of the services of any of our key employees, the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly engineers, could delay the development and introduction of and negatively impact our ability to develop, market, sell, or support our products. If we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements, we could incur additional costs which would harm our results of operations or experience manufacturing delays which would harm our business. Our contract manufacturers are not obligated to supply products for any specific period, in any specific quantity or at any specific price, except as may be provided in a particular purchase order because we do not have long term supply contracts with them. In addition, lead times for required materials and components vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier, contract terms and demand for each component at a given time. We provide to our contract manufacturers a demand forecast. If we overestimate our requirements, the contract manufacturers may assess charges that could negatively impact our gross margins. For example, for the quarter ended September 30, 2001, we recorded a charge for approximately $39.9 million associated with contractual liabilities and carrying charges on excess material at our contract manufacturers. If we underestimate our requirements, the contract manufacturers may have inadequate inventory, which could interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and revenues. We are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key components, which make us susceptible to shortages or price fluctuations. With the current demand for electronic products, component shortages are possible and the predictability of the availability of such components may be limited. We currently purchase several key components, including ASICs, from single or limited sources. For example, IBM is our ASIC supplier. We may not be able to develop an alternate or second source in a timely manner, which could hurt our ability to deliver product to customers. If we are unable to buy these components on a timely basis, we will not be able to deliver product to our customers, which would seriously impact present and future sales, which would, in turn, adversely affect our business. 30 Table of Contents We currently depend on contract manufacturers with whom we do not have long term supply contracts, and changes to those relationships, expected or unexpected, may result in delays or disruptions that could cause us to lose revenue and damage our customer relationships. We depend on independent contract manufacturers (each of whom is a third party manufacturer for numerous companies) to manufacture our products. We do not have a long term supply contract with such manufacturers and if we should fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships or if one or more of them should experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems in its manufacturing operations, our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed which could adversely affect our business and financial results. Litigation regarding intellectual property rights may be time consuming and require a significant amount of resources to prosecute or defend, therefore we may have to expend a substantial amount of resources to make our products non infringing and may have to pay a substantial amount of money in damages. Third parties have and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. For example, in 2003, Toshiba Corporation filed suit against us, alleging that our products infringe certain Toshiba patents. The asserted claims and or initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers, suppliers, or customers, alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our products. Regardless of the merit of these claims, they can be time consuming, result in costly litigation, require us to develop non infringing technologies or enter into license agreements. Furthermore, because of the potential for high court awards that are not necessarily predictable, even arguably unmeritorious claims may be settled for significant funds. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. We are a party to lawsuits, which, if determined adversely to us, could require us to pay damages which could harm our business and financial condition. We and certain of our former officers and current and former members of our board of directors are subject to various lawsuits. There can be no assurance that actions that have been or will be brought against us will be resolved in our favor. Regardless of whether they are in our favor, these lawsuits are, and any future lawsuits to which we may become a party in the future will likely be, expensive and time consuming to defend or resolve. Any losses resulting from these claims could adversely affect our profitability and cash flow. The long sales and implementation cycles for our products, as well as our expectation that customers will sporadically place large orders with short lead times may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter. A customers decision to purchase our products involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process. As a result, the sales cycle may be lengthy. Throughout the sales cycle, we often spend considerable time educating and providing information to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products. Even after making the decision to purchase, customers tend to deploy the products slowly and deliberately. Timing of deployment can vary widely and depends on the skill set of the customer, the size of the network deployment, the complexity of the customers network environment and the degree of hardware and software configuration necessary to deploy the products. Customers with large networks usually expand their networks in large increments on a periodic basis. Accordingly, we expect to receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular basis. These long cycles, as well as our expectation that customers will tend to sporadically place large orders with short lead times, may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter. 31 Table of Contents Our products incorporate and rely upon licensed third party technology and if licenses of third party technology do not continue to be available to us or become very expensive, our revenues and ability to develop and introduce new products could be adversely affected. We integrate licensed third party technology in certain of our products. From time to time we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements. Third party licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. Our inability to maintain or re license any third party licenses required in our current products or our inability to obtain third party licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements, could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Due to the global nature of our operations, economic or social conditions or changes in a particular country or region could adversely affect our sales or increase our costs and expenses, which would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. We conduct significant sales and customer support operations directly and indirectly through our resellers in countries outside of the United States and also depend on the operations of our contract manufacturers that are located outside of the United States. For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, we derived approximately 58% and 45% of our revenues, respectively, from sales outside North America. Accordingly, our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors including, among others, political or social unrest or economic instability in a specific country or region; trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements which may affect our ability to import or export our products from various countries; service provider and government spending patterns affected by political considerations; and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations. Any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenue, costs, expenses and financial condition. If our restructuring initiatives are not sufficient to meet industry and market conditions and to achieve future profitability, we may undertake further restructuring initiatives, which may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In response to industry and market conditions, we have restructured our business and reduced our workforce. The assumptions underlying our restructuring efforts will be assessed on an ongoing basis and may prove to be inaccurate and we may have to restructure our business again in the future to achieve certain cost savings and to strategically realign our resources. While restructuring, we have assessed, and will continue to assess, whether we should further reduce our workforce and facilities, as well as review the recoverability of our tangible and intangible assets, including the land purchased in January 2001. Any such decisions may result in the recording of additional charges, such as workforce reduction costs, facilities reduction costs, asset write downs, and contractual settlements. Additionally, estimates and assumptions used in asset valuations are subject to uncertainties, as are accounting estimates with respect to the useful life and ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets. As a result, future market conditions may result in further charges for the write down of tangible and intangible assets. We may not be able to successfully implement the initiatives we have undertaken in restructuring our business and, even if successfully implemented, these initiatives may not be sufficient to meet the changes in industry and market conditions and to achieve future profitability. Furthermore, our workforce reductions may impair our ability to realize our current or future business objectives. Lastly, costs actually incurred in connection with restructuring actions may be higher than the estimated costs of such actions and or may not lead to the anticipated cost savings. We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial results and cash flows. 32 Table of Contents Because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the United States, we face exposure to adverse movements in non US currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. The majority of our revenue and expenses are transacted in US Dollars. We also have some transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Japanese Yen, Hong Kong Dollar, British Pound and the Euro, related to our sale and service operations outside of the United States. An increase in the value of the US Dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the United States where we sell in US Dollars, and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent we must purchase components in foreign currencies. Currently, we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and periodically will hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows. The hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities. Our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our net income. Our quarterly results are inherently unpredictable and subject to substantial fluctuations and, as a result we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Our revenues, operating results, book to bill ratio and other financial indicators will vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, including many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate. The factors that may impact the unpredictability of our quarterly results include the reduced visibility into customers spending plans, the changing market conditions, which have resulted in some customer and potential customer bankruptcies, a change in the mix of our products sold, from higher priced core products to lower priced edge products, and long sales and implementation cycle. As a result, we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of operating results are not a good indication of future performance. It is likely that in some future quarters, operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in which case the price of our common stock may fall. If we fail to adequately evolve our financial and managerial control and reporting systems and processes, our ability to manage and grow our business will be negatively impacted. Our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process. We expect that we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial control and our reporting systems and procedures in order to manage our business effectively in the future. If we fail to continue to implement improved systems and processes, our ability to manage our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted. We sell our products to customers that use those products to build networks and IP infrastructure and if those networks and IP infrastructure do not continue to grow then our business, operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected. A substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth of IP infrastructure and on the deployment of our products by customers that depend on the continued growth of IP services. As a result of changes in the economy and capital spending, which have in the past particularly affected telecommunications service providers, spending on IP infrastructure can vary. A significant reduction in such spending would adversely affect our business. 33 Table of Contents Regulation of the telecommunications industry could harm our operating results and future prospects. The telecommunications industry is highly regulated and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by the changes in the regulations relating to the telecommunications industry. Currently, there are few laws or regulations that apply directly to access to or commerce on data networks. We could be adversely affected by regulation of those networks and commerce occurring on them in any country where we operate. Such regulations could include matters such as voice over the Internet or using Internet Protocol, encryption technology, and access charges for service providers. The adoption of such regulations could decrease demand for our products, and at the same time increase the cost of selling our products, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types and maturities. These securities are generally classified as available for sale and, consequently, are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on interest earnings of our investment portfolio. We do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures. The following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value of the financial instruments held at December 31, 2003 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates (in thousands): Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Fair Value Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Rate Decrease of X Basis Points (BPS) as of Rate Increase of X BPS December Issuer (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 31, 2003 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS Government treasury and agencies $ 155,828 $ 154,979 $ 154,131 $ 153,282 $ 152,434 $ 151,585 $ 150,737 Corporate bonds and notes 376,370 374,432 372,493 370,554 368,617 366,679 364,740 Asset backed securities and other 183,270 182,993 182,716 182,439 182,162 181,884 181,607 Total $ 715,468 $ 712,404 $ 709,340 $ 706,275 $ 703,213 $ 700,148 $ 697,084 These instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading. The modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (BPS), 100 BPS and 150 BPS, which are representative of the historical movements in the Federal Funds Rate. Foreign Currency Risk and Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts. The majority of our revenue and expenses are transacted in US dollars. However, since we have sales and service operations outside of the US, we do have some transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, Japanese Yen, Hong Kong Dollar, British Pound and the Australian Dollar. We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the effect of gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated primarily in the Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound and Australian Dollar. These derivatives are not designated as hedges under SFAS No. 133 (SFAS 133), Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. At December 31, 34 Table of Contents 2003, the notional and fair values of these contracts were insignificant. We do not expect gains and losses on these contracts to have a material impact on our financial results. We also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted transactions related to certain operating expenses, denominated primarily in the Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound and Australian Dollar. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133. At December 31, 2003, the notional and fair values of these contracts were insignificant. We do not expect gains and losses on these contracts to have a material impact on our financial results. These contracts have original maturities ranging from one to three months. We do not enter into foreign exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes. We attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign contracts with credit worthy financial institutions. 35 Table of Contents
