ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This Annual Report on Form 10 K (Report), including the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward looking statements regarding future events and the future results of the Company that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the industry in which the Company operates and the beliefs and assumptions of the management of the Company. Words such as expects, anticipates, targets, goals, projects, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. These forward looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this Report under the section entitled Factors That May Affect Future Results and elsewhere, and in other reports the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), specifically the most recent reports on Form 10 Q and the Joint Proxy/Prospectus included in the Registration Statement on Form S 4 filed with the SEC and declared effective on March 11, 2004. The Company undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason. The following discussion is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingencies. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to sales returns, warranty costs, allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long term assets, especially goodwill and intangible assets, contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges, and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Overview of the Results of Operations To aid in understanding our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, we believe an overview of the significant events that affected those periods and a discussion of the nature of our operating expenses is helpful. Significant Events In April 2004, we completed our acquisition of NetScreen Technologies, Inc. (NetScreen) in order to expand our customer base and portfolio of products. NetScreen developed, marketed and sold a broad array of integrated network security solutions for enterprises, carriers and government entities. We have included in our results of operations the results of NetScreen beginning on April 16, 2004; therefore, revenues, cost of revenues and operating expenses are significantly greater during 2004 compared to 2003 and 2002. As a result of the NetScreen acquisition, we expanded our customer base and portfolio of products, which resulted in two categories of networking products: infrastructure products, which consist predominately of the original Juniper Networks products, and security products, which consist predominately of the former NetScreen products. In July 2002, we completed our acquisition of Unisphere, a subsidiary of Siemens Corporation, which is a subsidiary of Siemens A.G. (Siemens). Since the acquisition Siemens has been one of our significant resellers. Unisphere developed, manufactured and sold data networking equipment optimized for applications at the edge of service provider networks. The acquisition enabled us to expand our 16 Table of Contents customer base and add a complementary product to our existing infrastructure product line without any need to reorganize or modify our existing organizational or cost structure. We have included in our results of operations for 2002 the results of Unisphere from July 1, 2002. The Unisphere acquisition impacted revenue, cost of revenues and all operating expenses for the second half of 2002. The results for 2003 include a full year of results of the combined companies. We have implemented several restructuring plans over the last four years as a result of the economic slowdown, which began in 2001, and the acquisitions of Unisphere and NetScreen. In connection with the acquisitions of Unisphere and NetScreen, we initiated plans to eliminate certain duplicative activities, focus on strategic product and customer bases, reduce cost structure and better align product and operating expenses with existing general economic conditions. During the three months ended September 30, 2003, we announced that we would no longer develop our G series CMTS products and recorded a charge that was comprised of workforce reduction costs, non inventory asset impairment, costs associated with vacating facilities and terminating contracts and other related costs. During 2004, we adjusted our restructuring reserves for changes in estimates, primarily related to changes in lease and sublease assumptions as our needs changed as a result of the NetScreen acquisition and as the real estate markets changed. During the three months ended June 30, 2003, we issued $400.0 million of Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2008 (Senior Notes). From January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2004, we paid $937.0 million to retire all of our remaining 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes due March 15, 2007 (Subordinated Notes). These transactions affected our cash, cash equivalents, investments, interest income and interest expense. Nature of Expenses NetScreen had a significant distribution channel in place at the time of the acquisition and we are using that channel to target new customers and increase sales. We plan to increase the volume of sales that go through our distribution channel during 2005 compared to prior years. This shift to selling more products through a distribution channel may impact gross margins. Most of our manufacturing, repair and supply chain operations are outsourced to independent contract manufacturers; accordingly, most of our cost of revenues consists of payments to our independent contract manufacturers for the standard product costs. The independent contract manufacturers produce our products using design specifications, quality assurance programs and standards that we establish. Controls around manufacturing, engineering and documentation are conducted at our facilities in Sunnyvale, California and Westford, Massachusetts. Our independent contract manufacturers have facilities primarily in Wisconsin, Canada and Malaysia. Generally, our contract manufacturers retain title to the underlying components and finished goods inventory until our customers take title to the assembled final product upon shipment from the contract manufacturers facility. The contract manufacturers procure components based on our build forecasts and if actual component usage is lower than our forecasts, we may be, and have been in the past, liable for carrying or obsolete material charges. Carrying and obsolete charges have decreased each of the past two years as the global economy and our product revenue improved. Employee related costs have historically been the primary driver of our operating expenses and we expect this trend to continue. Employee related costs include items such as wages, commissions, bonuses, vacation, benefits and travel. We added over 900 employees across all functions as a result of the NetScreen acquisition. We added approximately 400 employees from the Unisphere acquisition in July 2002. We had 2,948, 1,553 and 1,542 employees as of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Facility and information technology departmental costs are allocated to other departments based on headcount. These departmental costs have increased each of the last two years due to increases in headcount and facility leases resulting from acquisitions and additional infrastructure systems to support the companys growth. We expect these costs to continue to increase during 2005 as our headcount increases. 17 Table of Contents Research and development expenses include: the costs of developing our products from components to prototypes to finished products, outside services for such services as certifications of new products, equipment used for testing and patent related costs. Several components of our research and development effort require significant expenditures, such as the development of new components and the purchase of prototype equipment, the timing of which can cause quarterly variability in our expenses. We expense our research and development costs as they are incurred. We plan to increase our investment in research and development during 2005 compared to prior years to further advance our competitive advantage. Sales and marketing expenses include costs for promoting our products and services, demonstration equipment and advertisements. These costs vary quarter to quarter depending on revenues, product launches and marketing initiatives. We plan to further develop our distribution channel and increase our sales and marketing costs in an effort to expand and grow our presence in new markets, serving both private and public networks with a full portfolio of networking security products. General and administrative expenses include professional fees, bad debt provisions and other corporate expenses. Professional fees include legal, audit, tax, accounting and certain corporate strategic services. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to establish accounting policies that contain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These policies include: revenue recognition; estimating future warranty costs and the valuation of exposures associated with the contract manufacturing operations, both of which impact cost of product revenues and gross margins; the provision for income taxes, which impacts our income tax expense, and tax related accruals; the allowance for doubtful accounts, which impacts general and administrative expenses; and the initial and continuing valuation of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets, the impairment of which would impact operating expenses. We have other important accounting policies and practices; however, once adopted, these other policies either generally do not require us to make significant estimates or assumptions or otherwise only require implementation of the adopted policy and not a judgment as to the policy itself. We base our estimates on our historical experience and also on assumptions that we believe are standard and reasonable. Despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and assumptions, actual results could differ from those estimates for various reasons including those described in Factors That May Affect Future Results. 18 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition We recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured, unless we have future obligations for such things as customer acceptance, in which case revenue and related costs are deferred until those obligations are met. In most cases, we recognize product revenue upon shipment to our customers, including value added resellers (VAR), as it is our practice to identify an end user prior to shipment to a VAR. We defer revenues on sales to our distributors until we have information indicating that the distributor has sold the products to its customers. We recognize revenue from service contracts as the services are completed or ratably over the period of the obligation. A majority of our service revenue is earned from customers who purchase our products and enter into service contracts. Service contracts are typically for one year renewable periods and are for services such as 24 hour customer support, non specified updates and hardware repairs. In addition to service contracts, we also provide professional and educational services. On arrangements where products and services are bundled, we determine whether the deliverables are separable into multiple units of accounting. We allocate the total fee on such arrangements to the individual deliverables either based on their relative fair values or using the residual method, as circumstances dictate. We then recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with our policies for product and service revenue recognition. This process requires us to make judgments whether the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis and whether we have established objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items. Our ability to recognize revenue in the future may be affected if actual selling prices are significantly less than the fair values. In addition, our ability to recognize revenue in the future will be impacted by conditions imposed by our customers and by our assessment of collectibility. We assess the probability of collection by reviewing our customers payment history, financial condition and credit report. If the probability of collection is not reasonably assured, revenue is deferred until the payment is collected. The amount of product revenue recognized in a given period is also impacted by our judgments made in establishing our reserve for potential future product returns. Although our arrangements with end users and VARs generally do not include any contractual rights of return, and our general policy is that we do not accept returns, under certain circumstances we have accepted, and may in the future accept, product returns from our customers. Therefore, we do provide a reserve for our estimate of future returns against revenue in the period the revenue is recorded. Our estimate of future returns is based on such factors as historical return data and current economic condition of our customer base. In addition, we get input from our sales and support organizations on potential product returns relating to specific customer issues. The amount of revenue we recognize will be directly impacted by our estimates made to establish the reserve for potential future product returns. In addition, our agreements with distributors provide for limited stock rotation and price protection rights. Stock rotation rights provide distributors with the right to exchange unsold inventory for alternate products of equal or greater value. Price protection rights grant distributors the right to a credit on certain purchases in the event of decreases in the prices of our products. We accrue for these credits based on our estimates of expected stock rotation and price protection obligations. These reserves require us to exercise judgment in determining if historical experience applies to new products and to new distributors. If our estimate of returns and exchanges is too low, additional charges will be incurred in future periods and these additional charges could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Our resellers and distributors participate in various cooperative marketing and other programs, and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these programs. If actual amounts paid to our resellers and distributors for these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on inputs from our channel marketing department and historical experience, our revenue could be adversely affected. 19 Table of Contents Warranty Reserves We generally offer a one year warranty on all of our hardware products and a 90 day warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the products. The warranty generally includes parts and labor obtained through our 24 hour service center. On occasion, the specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary. We accrue for warranty costs based on estimates of the costs that may be incurred under our warranty obligations, including material costs, technical support labor costs and associated overhead. The warranty accrual is included in our cost of revenues and is recorded at the time revenue is recognized. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units, our estimates of anticipated rates of warranty claims, costs per claim and estimated support labor costs and the associated overhead. Our estimates of anticipated rates of warranty claims and costs per claim are primarily based on historical information and future forecasts. We periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. If actual warranty claims are significantly higher than forecast, or if the actual costs incurred to provide the warranty is greater than the forecast, our gross margins could be adversely affected. Contract Manufacturer Exposures We outsource most of our manufacturing, repair and supply chain management operations to our independent contract manufacturers and a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of payments to them. Our independent contract manufacturers procure components and manufacture our products based on our build forecasts. These forecasts are based on our estimates of future demand for our products, which are in turn based on historical trends and an analysis from our sales and marketing organizations, adjusted for overall market conditions. If the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast, which may be caused by factors outside of our control, we have contractual liabilities and exposures with the independent contract manufacturers, such as carrying costs and obsolete material exposures, that would have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability. Provision for Income Taxes and Tax Related Accruals Estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards. We regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income based on the realization criteria set forth under SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe to be more likely than not realizable. Accordingly, a valuation allowance in an amount equal to the U.S. domestic net deferred tax assets has been established to reflect uncertainty regarding future realization of these assets, in part, due to the potential impact of future stock option deductions. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities may result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimate of tax liabilities is less than the amount ultimately assessed, a further charge to expense would result. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable in our calculation of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In determining the amount of the allowance, we make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations and assess current economic trends affecting our customers that might impact the level of credit losses in the future and result in different rates of bad debts than previously seen. We also consider our historical level of credit losses. Our reserves historically have been adequate to cover our actual credit losses. If actual credit losses were to be significantly greater than the reserves we have established, our general and administrative expenses would increase. Conversely, if actual credit losses were to be significantly less than our reserves, our general and administrative expenses would decrease. 20 Table of Contents Valuation of Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets Purchased intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization of purchased intangibles is computed using the straight line method over the related expected useful lives of between four and seven years. Goodwill is carried at fair value. We perform goodwill impairment tests annually and on an interim basis in certain circumstances. We performed an impairment analysis in November 2004 and determined that there was no impairment of the goodwill at that time. In addition, on a quarterly basis we assess if there have been any impairment indictors during the past quarter that could have impacted the carrying value of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets. When valuing goodwill and purchased intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation and the ongoing evaluation for impairment, we estimate: the assets and liabilities of our two reporting units: Infrastructure and Security, the market value of each reporting unit, future cash flows applicable to each reporting unit, and the useful lives. These estimates include using our revenue and earnings multiples as of the test date, discounting to present value the free cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting units and the periods of time with which the products will be in demand. Any changes in key assumptions about the business, reporting units and its prospects, or changes in market conditions or other externalities, could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Results of Operations Net Revenues The following table shows product and service net revenues in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Product net revenues $ 1,162,928 87 % $ 602,455 86 % $ 467,651 86 % Service net revenues 173,091 13 % 98,938 14 % 78,896 14 % Total net revenues $ 1,336,019 100 % $ 701,393 100 % $ 546,547 100 % Our net revenues for each of the last three years have increased primarily as a result of the improving global economy, which resulted in increases in our customers capital expenditures for our products. Beginning in mid 2001, the overall global economy deteriorated and most of our customers reduced their capital expenditure budgets. We began to see these factors improve in 2003, as was evidenced by the increases in infrastructure chassis revenue units and ports shipped. The following table shows infrastructure revenue units and ports shipped for each of the last three years: Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Infrastructure chassis revenue units 7,102 4,785 3,517 Infrastructure ports shipped 114,543 73,471 54,897 Infrastructure products contributed $975.7 million to product net revenues during 2004. We track infrastructure revenue units and ports shipped to analyze customer trends and indicate areas of potential network growth. Our Infrastructure product platforms are essentially modular, with the chassis serving as the base of the platform. Each chassis has a certain number of slots that are available to be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces. The modules are the components through which the router receives incoming packets of data from a variety of transmission media. The physical connection between a transmission medium and a module is referred to as a port. The number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the functionality and throughput offered by the module. Chassis revenue units represent the number of chassis on which revenue was recognized during the period. 21 Table of Contents Security products contributed $187.2 million to product net revenues during 2004 based on approximately 81,000 units and the acquisition enabled us to cross sell Infrastructure and Security products to both customer bases. As we have expanded our market share and entered more markets in 2004, we have begun to experience increased price competition. This price competition has been limited to date, as evidenced by our increase in revenue dollars and product gross margins compared to the year ago period. We expect to see increasing price competition and downward pressure on our product gross margins in the future. Service net revenues increased each of the last two years as a result of a larger installed base of customers and products. A majority of our service revenue is earned from customers who purchase our products and enter into service contracts. Siemens accounted for greater than 10% of our net revenues during 2004 and 2003. Ericsson A.B. (Ericsson) accounted for greater than 10% of our net revenues during 2003 and 2002. The following table shows net revenue by geographic region (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Americas $ 609,145 46 % $ 296,151 42 % $ 300,022 55 % Europe, Middle East and Africa 380,497 28 % 186,436 27 % 131,139 24 % Asia Pacific 346,377 26 % 218,806 31 % 115,386 21 % Total net revenues $ 1,336,019 100 % $ 701,393 100 % $ 546,547 100 % We experienced a shift in net revenues as a percentage of total net revenues from the Americas region to Europe and Asia from 2002 to 2003 as our customers spending in the Americas region declined; however, as our customers spending improved from 2003 to 2004, the Americas region grew as a percentage of total net revenues. Given the current environment, we expect the split among the Americas and international regions to remain relatively consistent from 2004 to 2005. Cost of Revenues The following table shows cost of product and service revenues and the related gross margin (GM) percentages for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2004 GM% 2003 GM% 2002 GM% Cost of product revenues $ 317,616 73 % $ 200,621 67 % $ 179,721 62 % Cost of service revenues 92,958 46 % 56,728 43 % 50,387 36 % Total cost of revenues $ 410,574 69 % $ 257,349 63 % $ 230,108 58 % The six point increase in product gross margins from 2003 to 2004 was primarily due to cost cutting initiatives that resulted in standard costs and manufacturing support costs increasing at a lesser rate than product net revenues in terms of absolute dollars for the same periods. In addition, the standard margins on the Security products are more favorable than the standard margins on the Infrastructure products. The improvement in gross margins was also a result of a $16.0 million reduction in carrying and obsolescence charges from 2003 to 2004 as our historical charges paid to the contract manufacturers have decreased. The increase in gross margins was partially offset by acquisition charges related to the NetScreen acquisition, which increased cost of product revenues by $5.5 million, for an inventory write up adjustment and the amortization of the order backlog intangible asset. 22 Table of Contents The five point increase in product gross margins from 2002 to 2003 was primarily due to savings in outsourced manufacturing costs as a result of improved efficiencies and cost cutting initiatives at our contract manufacturers. The increase in product gross margins was also due to a $19.1 million decrease in carrying and obsolete material charges from 2002 to 2003. In addition, 2002 included a charge of $5.1 million related to the Unisphere acquisition for backlog orders and an inventory write up adjustment. Service gross margins increased three points from 2003 to 2004 and seven points from 2002 to 2003 as a result of improved efficiencies and economies of scale that were a direct result of a larger installed base, and thus a more leveraged service organization. This increased leverage is evidenced by the fact that total employee related expenses have decreased as a percentage of service revenue in each of the last two years: 26% for 2004, 27% for 2003 and 29% for 2002; however, in absolute dollars, employee related expenses increased $18.5 million from 2003 to 2004 and $3.9 million from 2002 to 2003. The increases in absolute dollars were due to the NetScreen and Unisphere acquisitions. In addition, in absolute dollars, the outside services costs increased $9.3 million from 2003 to 2004, primarily due to the NetScreen acquisition. Finally, the costs associated with spare parts decreased as a percent of service revenue from 2003 to 2004 and remained approximately the same in terms of absolute dollars; however the costs of spare parts increased as a percent of service revenue from 2002 to 2003 as the costs increased $2.6 million in terms of absolute dollars. Research and Development, Sales and Marketing and General and Administrative Expenses The following table shows research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Research and development $ 238,363 18 % $ 176,104 25 % $ 161,891 30 % Sales and marketing $ 302,345 23 % $ 145,784 21 % $ 126,803 23 % General and administrative $ 53,261 4 % $ 28,462 4 % $ 34,263 6 % Research and development expenses increased $62.3 million in 2004 compared to 2003, but decreased as a percent of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to employee related expenses increasing $42.4 million year over year as a result of the NetScreen acquisition. The increase in research and development expenses was also the result of a $6.5 million increase in expensed equipment primarily used in test activities and a $5.6 million increase in prototype expense. The increase in expensed equipment was due to additional research and development requirements resulting from the NetScreen acquisition. Prototype expenses are closely tied to product launches because of the testing and certification needed before a product can be offered to the public, and the amounts reported in a given period can vary depending on the product being developed and the timing of the release. Research and development expenses increased $14.2 million in 2003 compared to 2002, but decreased as a percent of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to a $13.2 million increase in employee related expenses as a result of a full year of operations after the acquisition of Unisphere. In addition, we stopped paying bonuses in 2002 as part of our overall corporate cost cutting initiatives; however, we started to accrue employee bonuses in the second half of 2003 as our financial results improved. Offsetting the increase in employee related expenses was a $2.5 million decrease in consulting and contractor services due to our overall corporate cost cutting initiatives and a $2.5 million decrease in prototype expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $156.6 million in 2004 compared to 2003 and increased as a percent of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to employee related expenses increasing $104.7 million year over year as a result of the NetScreen acquisition and the increase in revenue. Marketing related expenses increased $22.3 million due to the NetScreen acquisition, the branding of the combined companies and the development of a distribution channel and 23 Table of Contents channel sales. Outside services increased $7.0 million due to professional services related to marketing activities. In addition, demonstration equipment increased $6.4 million due to the NetScreen acquisition and the related purchase of Security demonstration products for our direct sales force and resellers. Demonstration equipment is expensed immediately and is closely tied to product launches. To date, we have not incurred significant advertising expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $19.0 million in 2003 compared to 2002, but decreased as a percent of total net revenues. The majority of the increase in absolute dollars was a $21.4 million increase in employee related expenses in the sales organization. In addition, customer facing expenses such as marketing events and customer programs increased $2.0 million. Offsetting the increases was a decrease of $2.8 million for demonstration equipment. General and administrative expenses increased $24.8 million in 2004 compared to 2003 and remained at 4% of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was driven by a $13.6 million increase in professional services and a $9.3 million increase in employee related expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased $5.8 million and as a percent of total net revenues in 2003 compared to 2002. The majority of the decrease was due to a $7.1 million reduction in bad debt expense in 2003 compared to 2002. This reduction was a result of more successful than expected collection efforts and the absence of any significant customer bankruptcies. The decrease in bad debt expense was partially offset by a $1.4 million increase in professional services related to certain strategic consulting activities. Other Operating Expenses The following table shows other operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Amortization of purchased intangible assets $ 56,782 $ 20,661 $ 13,896 Amortization of deferred stock compensation 43,955 2,037 408 Amortization of purchased intangible assets and deferred stock compensation $ 100,737 $ 22,698 $ 14,304 Restructuring costs $ (5,058 ) $ 13,985 $ 20,229 In process research and development $ 27,500 $ $ 83,479 Integration costs $ 5,087 $ $ 2,507 Amortization of Purchased Intangibles and Deferred Stock Compensation The amortization expense of intangible assets increased $36.1 million in 2004 compared to 2003 due to the intangible assets purchased in the NetScreen acquisition. The amortization expense of intangible assets increased $6.8 million in 2003 compared to 2002 due to the intangible assets purchased in the Unisphere acquisition. See Note 3 in Item 8 for more information on our purchased intangible assets. The amortization expense of deferred stock compensation increased $41.9 million in 2004 compared to 2003 due to the NetScreen acquisition. Amortization expense of deferred stock compensation was $2.0 million and $0.4 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. See Note 3 in Item 8 for more information on our deferred stock compensation. Restructuring and Other We have implemented several restructuring plans over the last four years as a result of the economic slowdown, which began in 2001 and began to improve in 2003, and the acquisitions of Unisphere and NetScreen. During 2004, we reduced previously established restructuring reserves by 24 Table of Contents $5.5 million for changes in estimates, primarily related to changes in lease and sublease assumptions. We found our needs changed as a result of the NetScreen acquisition and as the real estate markets changed. This reduction was offset by a restructuring charge of $0.4 million during the three months ended June 30, 2004 primarily related to the NetScreen acquisition. The restructuring charge recorded in 2004 has been completely paid out. The remaining restructuring charges from prior years are primarily for facility leases. The following is a summary of the restructuring plans, the related charges and the remaining obligations: At the time of the NetScreen acquisition, we accrued for restructuring charges of $21.3 million primarily related to professional services, severance and facility charges. These charges were recorded as part of the acquisition and did not impact the Statement of Operations. There is approximately $12.6 million remaining to be paid, primarily for facility leases that extend through 2008. During the third quarter of 2003, we announced that we are no longer developing our G series CMTS products and recorded a charge of approximately $14.0 million that was comprised of workforce reduction costs, non inventory asset impairment, vacating facilities costs, the costs associated with termination of contracts and other related costs. There is approximately $2.4 million remaining to be paid, primarily for a facility lease that extends through July 2008. During the third quarter of 2002, in connection with the acquisition of Unisphere, we recorded restructuring expenses of approximately $14.9 million, associated primarily with workforce related costs, costs of vacating duplicative facilities, contract termination costs, non inventory asset impairment charges and other associated costs. There is approximately $1.2 million remaining to be paid, primarily for facility leases that extend through April 2009. At the time of the Unisphere acquisition, we accrued for restructuring charges of $14.8 million primarily related to professional services, severance and facility charges. These charges were recorded as part of the acquisition and did not impact the Statement of Operations. There is approximately $1.4 million remaining to be paid, primarily for facility leases that extend through March 2011. We recognized a charge of approximately $5.3 million during the third quarter of 2002 related to the land acquired in January 2001 located in Sunnyvale, California. The charge was primarily for costs of exiting certain contractual obligations associated with the land. We currently have no plans to develop the land in the foreseeable future. See Note 5 in Item 8 for a complete description of all restructuring charges and the amounts remaining to be paid. In Process Research and Development The allocation of the NetScreen purchase price included $27.5 million to in process research and development (IPRD) and was expensed in the second quarter of 2004. Projects that qualify as IPRD represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and which have no alternative future use. Technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to a beta phase working prototype in which there is no remaining risk relating to the development. At the time of acquisition, NetScreen had multiple IPRD efforts under way for certain current and future product lines. These efforts included developing and integrating secure routers with embedded encryption chips, as well as other functions and features such as next generation Internet Protocol (IP), wireless and digital subscriber line connectivity and voice over IP capability. At the time of the NetScreen acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over the next eighteen months at an estimated cost of approximately $25 million. As of December 31, 2004, it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over the next nine months at an estimated cost of approximately $10.5 million. The Unisphere acquisition included $82.7 million of IPRD. These development efforts were completed as of December 31, 2003. 25 Table of Contents Integration We incurred integration expenses of approximately $5.1 million related to the NetScreen acquisition and $2.5 million related to the Unisphere acquisition. Integration expenses are incremental costs directly related to the integration of the two companies. The integration expenses consisted principally of workforce related expenses for individuals transitioning their positions and professional fees. Other Income and Expenses The following table shows other income and expenses for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Interest and other income $ 28,233 $ 33,428 $ 56,404 Interest expense $ (5,379 ) $ (39,099 ) $ (55,605 ) Write down of investments $ (2,939 ) $ $ (50,451 ) Gain (loss) on redemption of convertible subordinated notes $ (4,107 ) $ (1,085 ) $ 62,855 Gain on sale of investments $ $ 8,739 $ Equity in net loss of joint venture $ $ $ (1,316 ) Interest and other income decreased $5.2 million from 2003 to 2004 and $23.0 million from 2002 to 2003. Both decreases were the result of lower rates of return realized from our investments and less realized gains, partially offset by a gain of $3.5 million during 2004 from a non recurring engineering contract. Interest expense decreased $33.7 million from 2003 to 2004 and $16.5 million from 2002 to 2003, almost entirely due to interest saved from the retirement of our Subordinated Notes. We have certain minority equity investments in privately held companies that are carried at cost, adjusted for any impairment, as we do not have a controlling interest and do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over these companies. We wrote down these investments by $2.9 million and $50.5 million in 2004 and 2002, respectively, for changes in market value that we believed were other than temporary. We spent $145.0 million, $792.0 million and $146.0 million during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, to retire our Subordinated Notes. We recognized net losses of $4.1 million and $1.1 million during 2004 and 2003, respectively. We recognized a gain of $62.9 million during 2002. The losses and gains were a result of the difference between the carrying value of the Subordinated Notes at the time of their retirement, including unamortized debt costs, and the amount paid to extinguish such notes. During the first and second quarters of 2003, we sold some of our marketable equity securities classified as available for sale, which had a cost basis of $4.3 million, and recognized gains of $8.7 million. During the second quarter of 2001, we entered into a joint venture agreement with Ericsson to develop and market products for the wireless Internet infrastructure market. We recognized our portion of the net loss in this joint venture with Ericsson in the amount of $1.3 million during 2002. As of December 31, 2002, we had no further capital funding obligations to this joint venture. 26 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes increased to $83.3 million in 2004 from $19.8 million in 2003 due to the increase in income before income taxes. The effective rates were approximately 38% and 34% for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase was primarily due to in process research and development expenses related to an acquisition that were not deductible for tax purposes. The 2004 effective tax rate reflects taxes payable in certain foreign jurisdictions, the benefit of tax credits and the inability to benefit from certain charges and losses. The 2003 effective rate reflects taxes payable in certain foreign jurisdictions, the benefit of research credits and capital loss carryforwards and the inability to benefit from certain charges and losses. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has concluded an audit of our federal income tax returns for fiscal years 1999 and 2000. During 2004, we received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA) from the IRS. While the final resolution of the issues raised in the NOPA is uncertain, we believe we have made adequate provisions in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for any adjustments that the IRS has proposed with respect to these tax returns. In conjunction with the IRS income tax audit, certain of our US payroll tax returns are currently under examination for fiscal years 1999 2001, and we received a second NOPA in the amount of $11.7 million for employment tax assessments primarily related to the timing of tax deposits related to employee stock option exercises. We intend to dispute this assessment with the IRS and resolve the issue at the Appeals level. We currently do not believe that it is probable that any final assessment will be sustained nor do we believe that a liability can be reasonably estimated at this time. In the event that this issue is resolved unfavorably, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our results of operations for the period in which an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview We have funded our business by issuing securities and through our operating activities. The following table shows our capital resources (in thousands): As of December 31, 2004 2003 Cash and cash equivalents $ 713,182 $ 365,606 Short term investments $ 404,659 $ 215,906 Long term investments $ 595,234 $ 394,297 Restricted cash $ 31,226 $ 30,837 Working capital* $ 910,896 $ 425,421 *Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. See Note 2 in Item 8 for more information. Working capital increased $485.5 million from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to cash provided by operations of $439.4 million. The significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, short term investments and accounts receivable, reduced by accounts payable, accrued liabilities and deferred revenue. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, and cash generated from operations will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations through at least the next 12 months. In addition, there are no transactions, arrangements, and other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of our requirements for capital resources. 27 Table of Contents Cash Requirements and Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at December 31, 2004 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands): Less Than 1 3 3 5 More than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Operating leases, net of committed subleases (A) $ 206,032 $ 31,593 $ 59,202 $ 46,757 $ 68,480 Senior Notes (B) 400,000 400,000 Other contractual obligations (C) 13,558 13,122 421 15 Total $ 619,590 $ 44,715 $ 59,623 $ 446,772 $ 68,480 (A) We occupy approximately 1.3 million square feet world wide under operating leases. The majority of our office space is in North America, including our corporate headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. Our longest lease expires in May 2014. (B) Our principal commitment as of December 31, 2004 was our outstanding Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2008 (Senior Notes). The Senior Notes were issued in June 2003 and are senior unsecured obligations, rank on parity in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured debt, and rank senior to all of our existing and future debt that expressly provides that it is subordinated to the notes. The Senior Notes bear no interest, but are convertible into shares of our common stock, subject to certain conditions, at any time prior to maturity or their prior repurchase by Juniper Networks. The conversion rate is 49.6512 shares per each $1,000 principal amount of convertible notes, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. (C) Our other contractual obligations consist primarily of an agreement to purchase a portfolio of patents for $12.0 million, which was paid in January 2005. These patents will be amortized over their useful lives, which average 12.1 years. We do not have firm purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers. In order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply, the contract manufacturers place non cancelable, non returnable (NCNR) orders, which were valued at $69.9 million as of December 31, 2004, based on our build forecasts. We do not take ownership of the components and the NCNR orders do not represent firm purchase commitments pursuant to our agreements with the contract manufacturers. The components are used by the contract manufacturers to build products based on purchase orders we have received from our customers. We do not incur a liability for products built by the contract manufacturer until it fulfills our customers order and the order ships. However, if the components go unused, we may be assessed carrying charges or obsolete charges. As of December 31, 2004, we had accrued $19.0 million based on our estimate of such charges. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $439.4 million, $178.6 million and $2.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The cash provided by operating activities for each period was due to our net income (loss) adjusted by: non cash charges of $100.9 million, $6.8 million and $72.8 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, primarily for the tax benefit of employee stock option plans, in process research and development from the NetScreen and Unisphere acquisitions, a loss from the redemption of the Subordinated Notes and an impairment charge related to our equity investments; ongoing non cash charges of $145.7 million, $70.0 million and $63.0 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, for depreciation expense and amortization expenses of intangible assets, deferred compensation and debt costs; and 28 Table of Contents fluctuations during the normal course of business of $57.2 million, $62.5 million and $(13.8) million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, in accounts receivable, prepaid and other current assets, long term assets, accounts payables, accrued liabilities and deferred revenue. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $58.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net cash provided by investing activities was $300.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net cash used in investing activities was $295.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Investing activities included capital expenditures and the purchases and maturities of available for sale securities. Capital expenditures increased from 2003 to 2004 due to our business growing and the NetScreen acquisition. Our capital expenditures decreased from 2002 to 2003 as part of our overall corporate cost cutting initiatives. Investing activities include: $40.9 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired in connection with the NetScreen acquisition during 2004, $30.8 million of restricted cash funded during 2003 to establish a trust to secure our indemnification obligations to certain directors and officers, and $375.8 million paid during 2002 in connection with the Unisphere acquisition. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $33.4 million, $307.5 million and $119.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Cash was provided during all periods from the issuance of common stock related to employee option exercises and stock purchase plans. We spent $145.0 million, $792.0 million and $146.0 million during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, to retire our Subordinated Notes. We spent $63.6 million during 2004 to retire 2.9 million shares of our common stock. During the second quarter of 2003, we received net proceeds of $392.8 million from the issuance of the Senior Notes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB revised SFAS No. 123 (FAS 123R), Share Based Payment, which requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of employee stock options and similar awards. The accounting provisions of FAS 123R will be effective for us beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2005. We will adopt the provisions of FAS 123R using a modified prospective application. Under modified prospective application, FAS 123R, which provides certain changes to the method for valuing stock based compensation among other changes, will apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date and are subsequently modified or cancelled. Compensation expense for outstanding awards for which the requisite service had not been rendered as of the effective date will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated for pro forma disclosure purposes under FAS 123 (see Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We are in the process of determining how the new method of valuing stock based compensation as prescribed in FAS 123R will be applied to valuing stock based awards granted after the effective date and the impact the recognition of compensation expense related to such awards will have on our financial statements. The Emerging Issues Task Force issued EITF Issue No. 04 8, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share (EITF 04 8), during September 2004. EITF 04 8 states that all issued securities that have embedded conversion features that are contingently exercisable upon occurrence of a market price condition should be included in the calculation of diluted EPS, regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met. The EITF 04 8 consensus must be applied by retroactive restatement based on the terms in effect and amounts outstanding on the last day of the fiscal period in 29 Table of Contents which the consensus becomes effective. EITF 04 8 was effective for us beginning in the fourth quarter of 2004. EITF 04 8 applied to our Senior Notes that were issued in June 2003. The application of EITF 04 8 reduced the 2003 diluted earnings per share by one cent. We have restated our diluted shares and earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2003. Factors That May Affect Future Results Investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies involve significant risks. The market price of our stock reflects a higher multiple of expected future earning than many other companies. Accordingly, even small changes in investor expectations for our future growth and earnings, whether as a result of our actual financial results, acquisitions, industry changes or other factors, could trigger significant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock. Investors in our securities should carefully consider all of the relevant factors, including but not limited to the following factors, that could affect our stock price. We face intense competition that could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our financial results. Competition is intense in the markets that we address. The IP infrastructure market has historically been dominated by Cisco Systems, Inc., with other companies such as Alcatel S.A., Nortel Networks Corporation and Huawei Technologies providing products to a smaller segment of the market. In addition, a number of other small public or private companies have products or have announced plans for new products to address the same challenges that our products address. In the security products market, we face intense competition from a broader group of companies including appliance vendors such as Cisco Systems, Inc., SonicWALL, Inc., and Watchguard Technologies and software vendors such as CheckPoint Software Technologies and Symantec Corporation. We also compete with various emerging private companies and low cost network hardware suppliers that may position their products as replacements for ours. If we are unable to compete successfully against existing and future competitors on the basis of product offerings or price, we could experience a loss in market share and revenues and or be required to reduce prices, which could reduce our gross margins, and which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We rely on value added resellers and distribution partners to sell our products, and disruptions to or our failure to effectively develop and manage our distribution channel and the processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products. Our future success is highly dependent upon establishing and maintaining successful relationships with a variety of value added reseller and distribution partners. The majority of our revenues are derived through value added resellers and distributors, most of which also sell competitors products. Our revenues depend in part on the performance of these distributors and value added resellers. The loss of or reduction in sales to these value added resellers or distributors could materially reduce our revenues. Our competitors may in some cases be effective in incentivizing resellers or potential resellers to favor their products or to prevent or reduce sales of our products. If we fail to maintain relationships with these distribution partners, fail to develop new relationships with value added resellers and distributors in new markets or expand the number of resellers in existing markets, fail to manage, train or incent existing value added resellers and distributors effectively or if these partners are not successful in their sales efforts, sales of our products may decrease and our operating results would suffer. In addition, we recognize a substantial portion of our revenue based on a sell through model using information provided by our distributors. If those distributors provide us with inaccurate or untimely information, the amount or timing of our revenues could be adversely impacted. 30 Table of Contents Further, in order to develop and expand our distribution channel, we must continue to scale and improve our processes and procedures that support it, and those processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and inherently difficult to manage. Our failure to successfully manage and develop our distribution channel and the processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products. Integration of past acquisitions and future acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and stock price and may dilute the ownership of our stockholders. We have made, and may continue to make, acquisitions in order to enhance our business. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including problems combining the purchased operations, technologies or products, unanticipated costs, diversion of managements attention from our core businesses, adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers, risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we might acquire. The integration of businesses that we have acquired has been, and will continue to be, a complex, time consuming and expensive process. For example, although we completed the acquisition of NetScreen in April 2004, integration of the products, product roadmap, operations, and personnel is a continuing activity and will be for the foreseeable future. Acquisitions may also require us to issue common stock that dilutes the ownership of our current stockholders, assume liabilities, record goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges, incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets, and incur large and immediate write offs and restructuring and other related expenses, all of which could harm our operating results and financial condition. In addition, if we fail in our integration efforts and are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communication systems, operating procedures, financial controls and human resources practices, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected. A limited number of our customers comprise a significant portion of our revenues and any decrease in revenue from these customers could have an adverse effect on our net revenues and operating results. A substantial majority of our net revenues depend on sales to a limited number of customers and distribution partners. Siemens accounted for greater than 10% of our net revenues during 2004 and 2003. Ericsson A.B. accounted for greater than 10% of our net revenues during 2003 and 2002. Any downturn in the business of these customers or potential new customers could significantly decrease sales to such customers, which could adversely affect our net revenues and results of operations. In addition, there has been and continues to be consolidation in the telecommunications industry (for example, the recently announced planned acquisitions of ATT and MCI by SBC and Verizon, respectively). This consolidation may cause our customers who are involved in these acquisitions to suspend or indefinitely reduce their purchases of our products or have other unforeseen consequences. We expect gross margin to vary over time and our recent level of product gross margin may not be sustainable. Our recent level of product gross margins may not be sustainable and may be adversely affected in the future by numerous factors, including product mix shifts, increased price competition in one or more of the markets in which we compete, increases in material or labor costs, excess inventory or obsolescence charges from our contract manufacturers, increased costs due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to inventory holding periods if our forecasts do not accurately anticipate product demand, or our introduction of new products or entry into new markets with different pricing and cost structures. 31 Table of Contents We are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key components, which makes us susceptible to shortages or price fluctuations in our supply chain and we may face increased challenges in supply chain management in the future. With the current demand for electronic products, component shortages are possible and the predictability of the availability of such components may be limited. Growth in our business and the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and to establish optimal component levels. If shortages or delays persist, the price of these components may increase, or the components may not be available at all. We may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner and our revenues and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed. We currently purchase numerous key components, including application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), from single or limited sources. The development of alternate sources for those components is time consuming, difficult and costly. For example, IBM is our sole ASIC supplier for our infrastructure products and Toshiba America Electronic Components, Inc. is our sole ASIC supplier for our security products. In addition, the lead times associated with certain components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in quantities and delivery schedules. In the event of a component shortage or supply interruption from these suppliers, we may not be able to develop alternate or second sources in a timely manner. If, as a result, we are unable to buy these components in quantities sufficient to meet our requirements on a timely basis, we will not be able to deliver product to our customers, which would seriously impact present and future sales, which would, in turn, adversely affect our business. In addition, the development, licensing or acquisition of new products in the future may increase the complexity of supply chain management. Failure to effectively manage the supply of key components and products would adversely affect our business. If we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements, we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays which would harm our business. We provide demand forecasts to our contract manufacturers. If we overestimate our requirements, the contract manufacturers may assess charges or we may have liabilities for excess inventory, each of which could negatively affect our gross margins. Conversely, because lead times for required materials and components vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier, contract terms and the demand for each component at a given time, if we underestimate our requirements, the contract manufacturers may have inadequate materials and components required to produce our products, which could interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and deferral or loss of revenues. We are dependent on contract manufacturers with whom we do not have long term supply contracts, and changes to those relationships, expected or unexpected, may result in delays or disruptions that could cause us to lose revenue and damage our customer relationships. We depend on independent contract manufacturers (each of whom is a third party manufacturer for numerous companies) to manufacture our products. Although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers, those contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a long term basis in any specific quantity or at any specific price. In addition, it is time consuming and costly to qualify and implement additional contract manufacturer relationships. Therefore, if we should fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships or if one or more of them should experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations, or we had to change or add additional contract manufacturers, our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed. Also, the addition of manufacturing locations or contract manufacturers would increase the complexity of our supply chain management. For example, one of our contract manufacturers has recently begun manufacturing in Malaysia. Each of these factors could adversely affect our business and financial results. The fluctuating economic conditions make it difficult to predict revenues for a particular period and a shortfall in revenues may harm our operating results. Our revenues depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete. Economic weakness, customer financial difficulties and constrained spending 32 Table of Contents on network expansion has previously resulted (for example, in 2001 and 2002), and may in the future result, in decreased revenues and earnings and could also negatively impact our ability to forecast and manage our contract manufacturer relationships. Economic downturns may also lead to restructuring initiatives and associated expenses and impairment of investments. In addition, our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are, and will continue to be, fixed in the short term. Uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. Future economic weakness, customer financial difficulties and reductions in spending on network expansion could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently on our results of operations and stock price. Our products are highly technical and if they contain undetected software or hardware errors, our business could be adversely affected and we might have to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with any alleged or actual failure of our products and services. Our products are highly technical and complex, are critical to the operation of many networks and, in the case of our security products, provide and monitor network security and may protect valuable information. Our products have contained and may contain one or more undetected errors, defects or security vulnerabilities. Some errors in our products may only be discovered after a product has been installed and used by end customers. Any errors or security vulnerabilities discovered in our products after commercial release could result in loss of revenues or delay in revenue recognition, loss of customers and increased service and warranty cost, any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, we could face claims for product liability, tort or breach of warranty. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert managements attention. In addition, if our business liability insurance coverage is inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our financial condition could be harmed. If our products do not interoperate with our customers networks, installations will be delayed or cancelled and could harm our business. Our products are designed to interface with our customers existing networks, each of which have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards and products from other vendors. Many of our customers networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved. Our products will be required to interoperate with many or all of the products within these networks as well as future products in order to meet our customers requirements. If we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers networks, we may have to modify our software or hardware to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate and scale with the existing software and hardware, which could be costly and negatively impact our operating results. In addition, if our products do not interoperate with those of our customers networks, orders for our products could be cancelled or our products could be returned. This could hurt our operating results, damage our reputation and seriously harm our business and prospects. Traditional telecommunications companies and other large companies generally require more onerous terms and conditions of their vendors. As we seek to sell more products to such customers, we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that may have an adverse effect on our business. Traditional telecommunications companies and other large companies, because of their size, generally have had greater purchasing power and, accordingly, have requested and received more favorable terms, which often translate into more onerous terms and conditions for their vendors. As we seek to sell more products to this class of customer, we may be required to agree to such terms and conditions, which may include terms that affect our ability to recognize revenue and have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. For example, many customers in this class have purchased products from other vendors who promised certain functionality and failed to deliver such functionality and or had products that caused problems and outages in the networks of these customers. As a result, this class of customers may 33 Table of Contents request additional features from us and require substantial penalties for failure to deliver such features or may require substantial penalties for any network outages that may be caused by our products. These additional requests and penalties, if we are required to agree to them, may affect our ability to recognize the revenues from such sales, which may negatively affect our business and our financial condition. If we do not successfully anticipate market needs and develop products and product enhancements that meet those needs, or if those products do not gain market acceptance, we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to anticipate future market needs or be able to develop new products or product enhancements to meet such needs or to meet them in a timely manner. If we fail to anticipate the market requirements or to develop new products or product enhancements to meet those needs, such failure could substantially decrease market acceptance and sales of our present and future products, which would significantly harm our business and financial results. Even if we are able to anticipate and develop and commercially introduce new products and enhancements, there can be no assurance that new products or enhancements will achieve widespread market acceptance. Any failure of our products to achieve market acceptance could adversely affect our business and financial results. Our ability to develop, market and sell products could be harmed if we are unable to retain or hire key personnel. Our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain the services of key executive, engineering, sales, marketing and support personnel. The supply of highly qualified individuals, in particular engineers in very specialized technical areas, is limited and competition for such individuals is intense. None of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term. The loss of the services of any of our key employees, the inability to attract or retain key personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly engineers, could delay the development and introduction of new products, and negatively impact our ability to market, sell, or support our products. Recent rulemaking by the Financial Accounting Standards Board will require us to expense equity compensation given to our employees and will significantly harm our operating results and may reduce our ability to effectively utilize equity compensation to attract and retain employees. We historically have used stock options as a significant component of our employee compensation program in order to align employees interests with the interests of our stockholders, encourage employee retention, and provide competitive compensation packages. The Financial Accounting Standards Board has adopted changes that will require companies to record a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants and other equity incentives beginning July 1, 2005. By causing us to incur significantly increased compensation costs, such accounting changes will reduce our reported earnings and will require us to reduce the availability and amount of equity incentives provided to employees, which may make it more difficult for us to attract, retain and motivate key personnel. Each of these results could materially and adversely affect our business. Litigation regarding intellectual property rights may be time consuming, expensive and require a significant amount of resources to prosecute, defend or make our products non infringing. Third parties have asserted and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to our products. For example, in 2003, Toshiba Corporation filed a lawsuit against us, alleging that our products infringe certain Toshiba patents. The asserted claims and or initiated litigation may include claims against us or our manufacturers, suppliers, or customers, alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our products. Regardless of the merit of these claims, they can be time consuming, result in costly litigation and may require us to develop non infringing technologies or enter into license agreements. Furthermore, because of the potential for high awards of damages that are not necessarily predictable, even arguably unmeritorious claims may be settled for significant amounts of money. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made 34 Table of Contents against us by any third party is successful, if we are required to settle litigation for significant amounts of money, or if we fail to develop non infringing technology or license required proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. We are a party to lawsuits, which, if determined adversely to us, could require us to pay damages which could harm our business and financial condition. We and certain of our current and former officers and current and former members of our board of directors are subject to various lawsuits. There can be no assurance that actions that have been brought against us or may be brought against us will be resolved in our favor. Regardless of whether they are in our favor, these lawsuits are, and any future lawsuits to which we may become a party will likely be, expensive and time consuming to defend or resolve. Such costs of defense and any losses resulting from these claims could adversely affect our profitability and cash flow. The long sales and implementation cycles for our products, as well as our expectation that some customers will sporadically place large orders with short lead times, may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter. A customers decision to purchase certain of our products involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process. As a result, the sales cycle may be lengthy. Throughout the sales cycle, we may spend considerable time educating and providing information to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products. Even after making the decision to purchase, customers may deploy our products slowly and deliberately. Timing of deployment can vary widely and depends on the skill set of the customer, the size of the network deployment, the complexity of the customers network environment and the degree of hardware and software configuration necessary to deploy the products. Customers with large networks usually expand their networks in large increments on a periodic basis. Accordingly, we may receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular basis. These long cycles, as well as our expectation that customers will tend to sporadically place large orders with short lead times, may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter. Our products incorporate and rely upon licensed third party technology and if licenses of third party technology do not continue to be available to us or become very expensive, our revenues and ability to develop and introduce new products could be adversely affected. We integrate licensed third party technology into certain of our products. From time to time, we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements. Third party licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. Our inability to maintain or re license any third party licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain third party licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements, could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. A breach of network security could harm public perception of our security products, which could cause us to lose revenues. If an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in the network of a customer of our security products, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products, the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed. This could cause us to lose current and potential end customers or cause us to lose current and potential value added resellers and distributors. Because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques. 35 Table of Contents Due to the global nature of our operations, economic or social conditions or changes in a particular country or region could adversely affect our sales or increase our costs and expenses, which would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. We conduct significant sales and customer support operations directly and indirectly through our distributors and value added resellers in countries outside of the United States and also depend on the operations of our contract manufacturers and suppliers that are located outside of the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors including, among others, political or social unrest or economic instability in a specific country or region, trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements which may affect our ability to import or export our products from various countries, service provider and government spending patterns affected by political considerations and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations. Any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenue, costs, expenses and financial condition. Our success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure our business through rapidly fluctuating economic and market conditions. Past restructuring efforts may prove to be inadequate or may impair our ability to realize our current or future business objectives. Our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process to enable us to effectively scale our business and adjust our business in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions. In periods of market expansion, we have increased investment in our business by, for example increasing headcount and increasing our investment in research and development and other parts of our business. Conversely, during 2001 and 2002, in response to downward trending industry and market conditions, we restructured our business and reduced our workforce. In addition, we expect that we will have to change our facilities in certain locations and we may face difficulties and significant expenses identifying and moving into suitable office space and subleasing or assigning any surplus space. These changes and other similar actions taken to respond to fluctuating market and economic conditions have placed, and our anticipated future operations will continue to place, significant demands on our management resources. This may increase the potential likelihood of other risks, and our business may suffer if we fail to effectively manage changes in the size and scope of our operations. We may not be able to successfully implement the initiatives we have undertaken in restructuring our business in the past and, even if successfully implemented, these initiatives may not be sufficient to meet the changes in industry and market conditions. Furthermore, our workforce reductions may impair our ability to realize our current or future business objectives. Lastly, costs actually incurred in connection with restructuring actions may be higher than the estimated costs of such actions and or may not lead to the anticipated cost savings, all of which could harm our results of operations and financial condition. We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial results and cash flows. Because a majority of our business is conducted outside the United States, we face exposure to adverse movements in non US currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. The majority of our revenues and expenses are transacted in US Dollars. We also have some transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Japanese Yen, Hong Kong Dollar, British Pound and the Euro, related to our sales and service operations outside of the United States. An increase in the value of the US Dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the United States where we sell in US Dollars, and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent we must purchase components in foreign currencies. 36 Table of Contents Currently, we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and periodically will hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows. The hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities. If our attempts to hedge against these risks are not successful, our net income could be adversely impacted. Our quarterly results are inherently unpredictable and subject to substantial fluctuations and, as a result, we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate. The factors that may affect the unpredictability of our quarterly results include limited visibility into customer spending plans, changing market conditions, including some customer and potential customer bankruptcies, changes in the mix of products sold, long sales and implementation cycles, regional economic and political conditions and seasonality. For example, many companies experience seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns, particularly in the 1st and 3rd quarters. As a result, we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of operating results are not necessarily a good indication of what our future performance will be. It is likely that in some future quarters, our operating results may be below one or more of the expectations of securities analysts and investors in which case the price of our common stock may decline. Such a decline could occur, and has occurred in the past, even when we have met our publicly stated revenue and or earnings guidance. If we fail to adequately evolve our financial and managerial control and reporting systems and processes, our ability to manage and grow our business will be negatively affected. Our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market depends upon an effective planning and management process. We will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial control and our reporting systems and procedures in order to manage our business effectively in the future. If we fail to continue to implement improved systems and processes, our ability to manage our business and results of operations may be negatively affected. We sell our products to customers that use those products to build networks and IP infrastructure and, if the network and IP systems do not continue to grow, then our business, operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected. A substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on the growth of IP infrastructure and on the deployment of our products by customers that depend on the continued growth of IP services. As a result of changes in the economy and capital spending, which have in the past particularly affected telecommunications service providers, spending on IP infrastructure can vary, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Governmental regulations affecting the import or export of products could negatively affect our revenues. The United States and various foreign governments have imposed controls, export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies, especially encryption technology. In addition, from time to time, governmental agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology, such as requiring the escrow and governmental recovery of private encryption keys. Governmental regulation of encryption technology and regulation of imports or exports, or our failure to obtain required export approval of encryption technologies could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues. 37 Table of Contents While we believe that we currently have adequate internal controls over financial reporting, we are exposed to risks from recent legislation requiring companies to evaluate those internal controls. Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2004 requires our management to report on, and our independent auditors to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. We have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements. We expect to incur significant expenses and management resources to Section 404 compliance on an ongoing basis. In the event that our chief executive officer, chief financial officer or independent registered public accounting firm determine in the future that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective as defined under Section 404, investor perceptions may be adversely affected and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock. We are subject to risks arising from our international operations. We derive a majority of our revenues from our international operations, and we plan to continue expanding our business in international markets in the future. As a result of our international operations, we are affected by economic, regulatory and political conditions in foreign countries, including changes in IT spending generally, the imposition of government controls, changes or limitations in trade protection laws, unfavorable changes in tax treaties or laws, natural disasters, labor unrest, earnings expatriation restrictions, misappropriation of intellectual property, acts of terrorism and continued unrest in many regions and other factors, which could have a material impact on our international revenues and operations. In particular, in some countries we may experience reduced intellectual property protection. Moreover, local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the United States. In many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or United States regulations applicable to us. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors and agents will not take actions in violations of them. Violations of laws or key control policies by our employees, contractors or agents could result in financial reporting problems, fines, penalties, prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business. Regulation of the telecommunications industry could harm our operating results and future prospects. The telecommunications industry is highly regulated and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by the changes in the regulations relating to the telecommunications industry. Currently, there are few laws or regulations that apply directly to access to or commerce on IP networks. We could be adversely affected by regulation of IP networks and commerce in any country where we operate. Such regulations could include matters such as voice over the Internet or using Internet Protocol, encryption technology, and access charges for service providers. The adoption of such regulations could decrease demand for our products, and at the same time increase the cost of selling our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating result and financial condition. Changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results. Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types and maturities. These securities are generally classified as available for sale and, consequently, are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings of our investment portfolio. We do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures. The following table presents hypothetical changes in fair value of the financial instruments held at December 31, 2004 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates (in thousands): Fair Value Valuation of Securities Given an as of Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Interest Rate Decrease of X Basis Points (BPS) December Rate Increase of X BPS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 31, 2004 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS Government treasury and agencies $ 246,971 $ 245,623 $ 244,275 $ 242,926 $ 241,578 $ 240,230 $ 238,882 Corporate bonds and notes 538,734 535,506 532,278 529,050 525,822 522,594 519,366 Asset backed securities and other 354,231 353,832 353,434 353,036 352,638 352,239 351,841 Total $ 1,139,936 $ 1,134,961 $ 1,129,987 $ 1,125,012 $ 1,120,038 $ 1,115,063 $ 1,110,089 These instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading. The modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (BPS), 100 BPS and 150 BPS, which are representative of the historical movements in the Federal Funds Rate. Foreign Currency Risk and Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts It is our policy to use derivatives to partially offset our market exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies. We recognize these derivatives on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. We use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted transactions related to certain operating expenses, denominated primarily in the Euro, Japanese Yen, and British Pound. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges, and have maturities between one and two months. We attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with creditworthy financial institutions. For a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, and upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction, is subsequently reclassified into the consolidated statement of operations line item to which the hedged transaction relates. We record any ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments, which was immaterial during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, in other income/(expense) on our consolidated statement of operations. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income to other income/(expense) on the consolidated statement of operations at that time. For the years 39 Table of Contents ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, there were no material net gains or losses recognized in other income/(expense) relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur. Additionally, we use foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate transaction gains and losses generated by certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated primarily in the Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound. These derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other income/(expense). Changes in the fair value of these foreign exchange contracts are largely offset by remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. These foreign exchange contracts have maturities between one and two months. We performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the foreign exchange contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of December 31, 2004, the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
