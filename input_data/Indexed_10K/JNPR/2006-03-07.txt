Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This Annual Report on Form 10 K (Report), including the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward looking statements regarding future events and the future results of our Company that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the industry in which 22 Table of Contents we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management. Words such as expects, anticipates, targets, goals, projects, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. These forward looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this Report under the section entitled Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I and elsewhere, and in other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), specifically the most recent reports on Form 10 Q. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason. The following discussion is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingencies. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, sales returns, warranty costs, allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long term assets, especially goodwill and intangible assets, contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges, tax, and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Overview of the Results of Operations To aid in understanding our operating results for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, we believe an overview of the significant events that affected those periods and a discussion of the nature of our operating expenses is helpful. Significant Events Business Acquisitions We completed a total of six acquisitions in the three years ended December 31, 2005. The main purposes of these acquisitions were to expand our product portfolio and customer base. The results of the following acquisitions have been included in our consolidated statements of operations beginning on their respective acquisition dates. The following is a summary of our acquisitions: Year Ended December 31, 2005: Funk Software, Inc. (Funk) acquired on December 1, 2005: Developed and sold products designed to protect the integrity of the network by verifying users and devices that meet an organizations security policies before granting network access. Acorn Packet Solutions, Inc. (Acorn) acquired on October 20, 2005: Developed and sold products that enable migration from circuit based networks to more flexible and cost effective IP networks. Peribit Networks, Inc. (Peribit) acquired on July 1, 2005: Developed and sold products that enhance wide area network (WAN) optimization and application delivery. Redline Networks, Inc. (Redline) acquired on May 2, 2005: Developed and sold application front end platforms for enterprise data centers and public web sites. Kagoor Networks, Inc. (Kagoor) acquired on May 1, 2005: Developed and sold session border control products to enhance voice over Internet Protocol networking for communication carriers. 23 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2004: NetScreen Technologies, Inc. (NetScreen) acquired on April 16, 2004: Developed and sold a broad array of integrated network security solutions for enterprises, carriers, and government entities. Acquisition Related Liabilities In connection with our acquisitions, we recorded liabilities associated with severance, future lease, and other obligations. The initial liabilities were recorded as part of the acquisitions and did not impact the Statements of Operations. The following is a summary of these liabilities: In 2005, we recorded liabilities of $4.5 million for the five acquisitions of that year, primarily related to future lease, severance, and other contractual obligations. As of December 31, 2005, there was $2.6 million remaining to be paid primarily related to future lease, severance, and other contractual obligations. At the time of the NetScreen acquisition in 2004, we accrued $21.3 million primarily related to professional services, severance and facility charges. There is approximately $3.1 million remaining to be paid, primarily for facility leases that extend through 2008. At the time of the acquisition of Unisphere Networks, Inc. (Unisphere) in 2002, we accrued $14.8 million primarily related to professional services, severance and facility charges. There is approximately $1.2 million remaining to be paid, primarily for facility leases that extend through March 2011. Segments As a result of these six acquisitions, we now offer two categories of products as well as services organized into the following three operating segments: Infrastructure: Products consist of the original Juniper Networks router portfolio and Acorn products. Service Layer Technologies (SLT): Products include the Funk, Peribit, Redline, Kagoor, and NetScreen products. Service: Delivers world wide services to customers of the Infrastructure and SLT segments. Acceleration of Unvested and Out of the Money Employee Stock Options On December 16, 2005, our Board of Directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of certain unvested and out of the money stock options that had an exercise price per share equal to or greater than $22.00, all of which were previously granted under our stock option plans and that were outstanding on December 16, 2005. Options to purchase approximately 21.2 million shares of common stock or 49.3% of our total outstanding unvested options on December 16, 2005 were accelerated. The options accelerated excluded options previously granted to certain employees, including all of our executive officers and our directors. In addition, the acceleration of the unvested and out of the money options was accompanied by restrictions imposed on any shares purchased through the exercise of accelerated options. Those restrictions will prevent the sale of any such shares prior to the date such shares would have originally vested had the optionee been employed on such date, whether or not the optionee is actually an employee at that time. The purpose of the acceleration was to enable us to avoid recognizing compensation expense associated with these options in future periods in our Statements of Operations pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123R (SFAS 123R). Under SFAS 123R, we will apply the expense recognition provisions relating to stock options beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. In approving the acceleration, our Board considered its impact on future financial results, stockholder value and employee retention. We believe that the acceleration of the unvested and out of the money options was in the best interest of stockholders as it will reduce our reported compensation expense in future periods in light of these accounting regulations. As a result of the acceleration, we expect to reduce the pre tax stock option expense we otherwise would have been required to record by approximately $153 million subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 123R beginning in 2006. The acceleration of the vesting of these options did not result in a charge to our results of operations in 2005. 24 Table of Contents The rules regarding option expensing are relatively recent. It is possible that changes to existing rules, adoption of new rules or the promulgation of rulings or interpretations by the Securities and Exchange Commission or other bodies, could cause the ultimate accounting treatment of our options to vary from our current expectations, and if applied to periods prior to such changes or rulings, could result in changes to historically reported financial information. Restructuring and Other Related Charges Restructuring Reserves We initiated restructuring plans to eliminate certain duplicative activities, focus on strategic product and customer bases, reduce cost structure and better align product and operating expenses with existing general economic conditions. The following is a summary of our restructuring plans charged to operating expenses in the Statements of Operations: In 2004, we implemented a restructuring plan at the time of the acquisition of NetScreen. We initially recorded a charge of approximately $0.4 million primarily related to workforce reduction costs, which has been completely paid out as of December 31, 2005. In 2003, we implemented a restructuring plan, under which we announced that we would no longer develop our G series CMTS products and recorded a charge that was comprised of workforce reduction costs, non inventory asset impairment, costs associated with vacating facilities and terminating contracts and other related costs. We initially recorded a charge of approximately $14.0 million that was comprised of workforce reduction costs, non inventory asset impairment, vacating facilities costs, the costs associated with termination of contracts and other related costs. As of December 31, 2005, approximately $1.4 million remained unpaid primarily for a facility lease that extends through July 2008. In 2002, we implemented a restructuring plan at the time of the Unisphere acquisition. We initially recorded a charge of $14.9 million, of which approximately $0.7 million remained unpaid as of December 31, 2005, primarily for facility leases that extend through April 2009. During 2005 and 2004, we adjusted our restructuring reserves primarily due to changes in lease and sublease assumptions as our needs changed as a result of our recent acquisitions and as the real estate markets changed. See Note 5 in Item 8 for a complete description of all restructuring charges and the amounts remained to be paid. Impairment Charges We evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flow the asset is expected to generate. If an asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment charge to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. We assess the recoverability of our long lived and intangible assets by determining whether the unamortized balances can be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows of the related assets. The amount of impairment, if any, is measured based on projected discounted future net cash flows. In December 2005, we recorded an impairment charge of $5.9 million related to certain Kagoor purchased intangibles as a result of a significant reduction in our forecasted revenue associated with Kagoor products. Debt Retirement Through December 31, 2004, we paid a total of $937.0 million to retire all of our remaining 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes due March 15, 2007 (Subordinated Notes). These transactions affected our cash and cash equivalents, investments, interest income and interest expense. Tax Repatriation We repatriated $225.0 million under the American Jobs Creation Act (Jobs Act) in 2005. We recorded a net tax benefit in 2005 of $19.7 million related to this repatriation dividend. The net tax benefit consists of a federal and state tax 25 Table of Contents provision, net of federal benefit, of $9.7 million, offset by a tax benefit of $29.4 million related to an adjustment of deferred tax liabilities on un repatriated earnings. Nature of Expenses We have an extensive distribution channel in place that we use to target new customers and increase sales. We have made substantial investments in our distribution channel during 2005 and 2004. Most of our manufacturing, repair and supply chain operations are outsourced to independent contract manufacturers; accordingly, most of our cost of revenues consists of payments to our independent contract manufacturers for the standard product costs. The independent contract manufacturers produce our products using design specifications, quality assurance programs and standards that we establish. Controls around manufacturing, engineering and documentation are conducted at our facilities in Sunnyvale, California and Westford, Massachusetts. Our independent contract manufacturers have facilities primarily in Canada, China, Malaysia, and the United States. We generally do not own the components and title to products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon shipment. The contract manufacturers procure components based on our build forecasts and if actual component usage is lower than our forecasts, we may be, and have been in the past, liable for carrying or obsolete material charges. Employee related costs have historically been the primary driver of our operating expenses and we expect this trend to continue. Employee related costs include items such as wages, commissions, bonuses, vacation, benefits and travel. We added over 420 and 900 employees in 2005 and 2004, respectively, across all functions as a result of acquisitions. We had 4,145, 2,948, and 1,553 employees as of December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Facility and information technology departmental costs are allocated to other departments based on headcount. These departmental costs have increased each of the last two years due to increases in headcount and facility leases resulting from acquisitions and additional infrastructure systems to support our growth. We expect these costs to stabilize in 2006. Research and development expenses include: the costs of developing our products from components to prototypes to finished products, outside services for such services as certifications of new products, and expenditures associated with equipment used for testing. Several components of our research and development effort require significant expenditures, such as the development of new components and the purchase of prototype equipment, the timing of which can cause quarterly variability in our expenses. We expense our research and development costs as they are incurred. We plan to increase our investment in research and development during 2006 compared to 2005 to further advance our competitive advantage. Sales and marketing expenses include costs for promoting our products and services, demonstration equipment and advertisements. These costs vary quarter to quarter depending on revenues, product launches and marketing initiatives. We plan to further develop our distribution channel in 2006 in an effort to expand and grow our presence in new markets, serving both private and public networks with a full portfolio of networking products. General and administrative expenses include professional fees, bad debt provisions and other corporate expenses. Professional fees include legal, audit, tax, accounting and certain corporate strategic services. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period. We regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical 26 Table of Contents experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from managements estimates. To the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future results of operations will be affected. We believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery or performance has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Evidence of an arrangement generally consists of customer purchase orders and, in certain instances, sales contracts or agreements. Shipping terms and related documents, or written evidence of customer acceptance, when applicable, are used to verify delivery or performance. We assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and the customers payment history to us. On arrangements where products and services are bundled, we determine whether the deliverables are separable into multiple units of accounting. We allocate the total fee on such arrangements to the individual deliverables either based on their relative fair values or using the residual method, as circumstances dictate. We then recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with its policies for product and service revenue recognition. Our ability to recognize revenue in the future may be affected if actual selling prices are significantly less than fair value. In addition, our ability to recognize revenue in the future could be impacted by conditions imposed by our customers. For sales to direct end users and value added resellers, we recognize product revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss, which is generally upon shipment. It is our practice to identify an end user prior to shipment to a value added reseller. For our end users and value added resellers, there are no significant obligations for future performance such as rights of return or pricing credits. A portion of our sales are made through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits and or rights of return. We recognize product revenue on sales made through these distributors upon sell through as reported to us by the distributors. We recognize revenue from service contracts as services are completed or ratably over the period of the obligation. We record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments, such as rebates and price protection, in the same period that the related revenue is recorded. The amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns and price protection credits, specific criteria included in rebate agreements, and other factors known at the time. Additional reductions to revenue would result if actual product returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of any of our customers was to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of its ability to make payments, additional allowances could be required. Contract Manufacturer Liabilities. We outsource most of our manufacturing, repair and supply chain management operations to our independent contract manufacturers and a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of payments to them. Our independent contract manufacturers procure components and manufacture our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts are based on our estimates of future demand for our products, which are in turn based on historical trends and an analysis from our sales and marketing organizations, adjusted for overall market conditions. We establish reserves for carrying charges and obsolete material charges for excess components purchased based on historical trends. If the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast, which may be caused by factors outside of our control, we have contractual liabilities and exposures with the independent contract manufacturers, such as carrying costs and obsolete material exposures, which would have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability. Warranty Reserve. We generally offer a one year warranty on all of our hardware products and a 90 day warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the products. We establish reserves for estimated product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized. Although we engage in extensive product 27 Table of Contents quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, use of materials and technical labor costs and associated overhead incurred in correcting any product failure. Should actual product failure rates, use of materials or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, additional warranty reserves could be required, which could reduce gross margins. Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets. Goodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. The amounts and useful lives assigned to other intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization, and the amount assigned to in process research and development is expensed immediately. The value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, could be impacted by future adverse changes such as: (i) future declines in our operating results, (ii) a decline in the valuation of technology company stocks, including the valuation of our common stock, (iii) significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or the networking industry or (iv) failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results. We evaluate these assets on an annual basis as of November 1 or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. In the process of our annual impairment review, we use the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as the market approach to determine the fair value of our intangible assets. Significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation. The estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business. It is possible, however, that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect. If our actual results, or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses, are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets, we could incur additional impairment charges. Income Taxes. Estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences and carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. Deferred tax assets attributable to tax deductions related to stock options are not considered realizable prior to their utilization on tax returns, at which point a current tax savings results and equity is credited for such savings. We regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income based on the realization criteria set forth under SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe to be more likely than not realizable. We believe it is more likely than not that forecasted income together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Similarly, if we subsequently realize deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation allowance would be reversed, resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings or a decrease in goodwill in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities may result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimate of tax liabilities is less than the amount ultimately assessed, a further charge to expense would result. Litigation and Settlement Costs. From time to time, we are involved in disputes, litigation and other legal actions. We are aggressively defending our current litigation matters, however, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and we cannot assure you that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation and or substantial settlement charges. In addition the resolution of any future intellectual property litigation may require us to make royalty payments, which could adversely impact gross margins in future periods. If any of those events were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We record a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency when both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the range of loss can be reasonably estimated. However the actual liability in any such litigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to record additional expenses. 28 Table of Contents Loss Contingencies. We are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required. Results of Operations The increases in revenues, cost of expenses, and operating expenses in 2005 compared to 2004 are attributable to, to a certain extent, the inclusion of the results of operations from Funk, Acorn, Peribit, Redline, and Kagoor for part of 2005, and NetScreen for the full year in 2005. Revenues, cost of revenues, and operating expenses were significantly greater during 2004 compared to 2003 due to the NetScreen acquisition. Net Revenues The following table shows net revenues and net revenues as a percentage of total net revenues (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Product net revenues $ 1,771.0 86 % $ 1,162.9 87 % $ 602.5 86 % Service net revenues 293.0 14 % 173.1 13 % 98.9 14 % Total net revenues $ 2,064.0 100 % $ 1,336.0 100 % $ 701.4 100 % Our total net revenues increased to $2,064.0 million in 2005 and represents a growth of 54% from 2004. Our total net revenues increased to $1,336.0 million in 2004 and represents a growth of 90% from 2003. Product Net Revenues The $608.1 million or 52% increase in our net product revenue from 2004 to 2005 was primarily a result of the adoption and expansion of IP networks by our customers in order to reduce total operating costs and to be able to offer multiple services over a single network and as a result of the expansion of our product portfolio through acquisitions and internal development. During 2005, we recognized $32.7 million of product revenue from product shipments made to end users and value added resellers that were deferred as of December 31, 2004. Infrastructure products accounted for $1,367.8 million or 77% of our total product net revenues during 2005. Infrastructure product net revenue grew by 40% from 2004 to 2005, primarily due to the increase in revenues from service providers and enterprises. SLT products accounted for $403.2 million or 23% of our total product net revenues during 2005. Our SLT product revenue was primarily driven by the increased demand by the enterprise market. Our higher net revenues in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to the revenue growth from Security products. Additionally, the acquisitions made in 2005 enabled us to cross sell infrastructure, security, and application acceleration products to existing customer bases. An analysis of the change in revenue by Infrastructure and SLT segments, and the change in units, can be found below in the section titled Segment Information. Net product revenue increased from 2003 to 2004 primarily as a result of the increase in Infrastructure product shipments to meet the customers capital expenditures demands, and to a lesser extent, due to SLT net revenue related to the NetScreen acquisition. Service Net Revenues Net service revenues increased $119.9 million or 69% from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to the growth in support services and, to a lesser degree, the growth in professional services. The growth in the support services was largely due to improved renewal rates and our growing installed base. We recognize revenue from service contracts as the services are completed or ratably over the period of the obligation. A majority of our service revenue is earned from customers who purchase our products and enter into service contracts that are typically for one year renewable periods. 29 Table of Contents Net service revenues increased from 2003 to 2004 primarily as a result of the increase in installed base of customers and products. Total Net Revenues The following table shows net revenue by geographic region (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Americas: United States $ 879.0 43 % $ 561.5 42 % $ 268.2 38 % Other 53.9 2 % 47.6 4 % 28.0 4 % Total Americas 932.9 45 % 609.1 46 % 296.2 42 % Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) 610.1 30 % 380.5 28 % 186.4 27 % Asia Pacific: Japan 204.8 10 % 155.7 12 % 102.4 15 % Other 316.2 15 % 190.7 14 % 116.4 16 % Total Asia Pacific 521.0 25 % 346.4 26 % 218.8 31 % Total $ 2,064.0 100 % $ 1,336.0 100 % $ 701.4 100 % We continue to experience varying distribution of revenue among our three geographic theaters, and we expect this trend to continue. Net revenue in the United States as a percentage of total net revenue increased in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to the growth driven by increased demand within the service provider and enterprise markets. Net revenue in EMEA as a percentage of total net revenue increased in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to strength across the region, including Finland, Greece, Italy, Poland, and the United Kingdom. Net revenue in Japan as a percentage of total net revenue decreased in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to completion by customers of several network expansion projects and a pause in the build out of their next generation network, or NGN. Net revenue in other Asia Pacific countries as a percentage of total net revenue remained fairly consistent with prior years. In 2004, net revenue in the Americas region grew as a percentage of total net revenue due to the improvement in customer spending in the United States. Siemens accounted for greater than 10% of our net product and service revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003. Ericsson accounted for greater than 10% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003. We expect that our largest customers, as well as key strategic partners, will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenue in 2006 and for the foreseeable future. Cost of Revenues The following table shows cost of product and service revenues and the related gross margin (GM) percentages (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2005 GM% 2004 GM% 2003 GM% Cost of product revenues $ 506.1 71 % $ 318.1 73 % $ 200.6 67 % Cost of service revenues 146.8 50 % 95.3 45 % 56.7 43 % Total cost of revenues $ 652.9 68 % $ 413.4 69 % $ 257.3 63 % Reclassifications have been made to product costs in 2004 and 2003 to include related stock compensation expense to conform to the current year presentation. The two percentage points decrease in product gross margins from 2004 to 2005 was primarily due to increasing competition as certain of our products have become more mature in their product cycles. As we have expanded our market share and entered more markets since 2004, we have begun to experience increased price competition. This price competition has been limited to date, as evidenced by our increase in revenue dollars compared to the year ago period as well as relatively comparable product gross margins from year to year. We expect to see increasing price competition and downward pressure on our product gross margins in the future. Nevertheless, higher product revenue volume contributed to the increased gross margin by $420.1 million, or 50% in 2005 when compared to 2004. 30 Table of Contents The six percentage points increase in product gross margins from 2003 to 2004 was primarily due to cost cutting initiatives that resulted in standard costs and manufacturing support costs increasing at a lesser rate than product net revenues in terms of absolute dollars for the same periods. In addition, the standard margins on the original NetScreen products are more favorable than the standard margins on the Infrastructure products and NetScreens acquisition in 2004 contributed to the increases compared to prior year. The improvement in gross margins was also a result of a $16.0 million reduction in carrying and obsolescence charges from 2003 to 2004 as our historical charges paid to the contract manufacturers decreased. The increase in gross margins was partially offset by acquisition charges related to the NetScreen acquisition, which increased cost of product revenues by $5.5 million, for an inventory fair value adjustment and the amortization of the order backlog intangible asset. Service gross margins increased five percentage points from 2004 to 2005 and was primarily attributable to a larger revenue increase when compared to the increase in headcount, outside services, and spares purchases, all of which were needed to support the growing installed base. Total employee related expenses as a percentage of service revenue for 2005 decreased to 22% compared to 26% for 2004. Nevertheless, in absolute dollars, total service related costs increased in 2005 compared to 2004: employee related expenses increased $20.2 million, and outside service expenses increased by $17.5 million as a result of increased headcount during 2005. In addition, expense associated with spares increased by $7.1 million. Service gross margins increased two percentage points from 2003 to 2004 as a result of improved efficiencies and economies of scale that were a direct result of a larger installed base, and thus a more leveraged service organization. This increased leverage was evidenced by the fact that total employee related expenses decreased as a percentage of service revenue: 26% for 2004 and 27% for 2003; however, in absolute dollars, employee related expenses increased $18.5 million from 2003 to 2004. The increases in absolute dollars were due to the NetScreen acquisition. In addition, in absolute dollars, outside services costs increased $9.3 million from 2003 to 2004, primarily due to the NetScreen acquisition. Finally, the costs associated with spare parts decreased as a percent of service revenue from 2003 to 2004 and remained approximately the same in terms of absolute dollars. Research and Development, Sales and Marketing and General and Administrative Expenses The following table shows research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses amounts and as a percentage of total net revenues (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Research and development $ 355.4 17 % $ 259.9 19 % $ 178.0 25 % Sales and marketing 439.6 21 % 320.0 24 % 146.0 21 % General and administrative 74.8 4 % 55.2 4 % 28.4 4 % Reclassifications were made to the 2004 and 2003 amounts to include related stock compensation expense to conform to the current year presentation. Research and development expenses increased $95.5 million in 2005 compared to 2004, but decreased as a percent of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases in personnel related expenses of $66.4 million, facility related expenses of $14.1 million, engineering and testing expenses of $12.6 million, equipment related expenses of $8.5 million, and depreciation of $5.1 million. The increases in personnel related expenses in 2005 were primarily due to additional hires in the engineering organization, including those from the five acquisitions. The increase is partially offset by the decrease in stock compensation expense of $11.6 million compared to 2004 as a result of forfeitures of unvested options in 2005. We continue to invest in both stand alone as well as integrated products in order to satisfy our customer needs. In addition, we invested and expanded on our global research and development efforts, specifically in China and India. Research and development expenses increased $81.9 million in 2004 compared to 2003, but decreased as a percent of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to employee related expenses increasing $42.4 million year over year as a result of the NetScreen acquisition. The increase in research and development expenses was also the result of a $6.5 million increase in expensed equipment primarily used in test activities and a $5.6 million increase in prototype expense. The increase in expensed equipment was due to additional research and development requirements resulting from the NetScreen acquisition. Prototype expenses are closely tied to product launches because of the testing and certification needed before a product can be offered to the public, and the amounts reported in a given period can vary depending on the product being developed and the timing 31 Table of Contents of the release. Stock compensation expense increased by $19.6 million due to the additional amortization of stock options assumed from the NetScreen acquisition. Sales and marketing expenses increased $119.6 million in 2005 compared to 2004 and decreased as a percent of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases in personnel related expenses of $97.3 million, increases in marketing related activities of $10.9 million, and increases in equipment related expenses of $2.6 million. Personnel related expenses increased in 2005 primarily due to additional hires, including acquisitions, to support the expansion of our distribution channels and customer base, as well as to support the larger portfolio of products. Marketing related activities increased primarily as a result of specific activities designed to expand and improve our distribution channels, introduction of new products, and increase awareness of our existing products to a broader range of customers. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in stock compensation expense of $12.9 million compared to 2004 due primarily to the forfeitures of unvested options in 2005. Sales and marketing expenses increased $174.0 million in 2004 compared to 2003 and increased as a percent of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to employee related expenses increasing $104.7 million year over year as a result of the NetScreen acquisition and the increase in revenue. Marketing related expenses increased $22.3 million due to the NetScreen acquisition, the branding of the combined companies and the development of a distribution channel and channel sales. Outside services increased $7.0 million due to professional services related to marketing activities. In addition, demonstration equipment increased $6.4 million due to the NetScreen acquisition and the related purchase of Security demonstration products for our direct sales force and resellers. Demonstration equipment is expensed immediately and is closely tied to product launches. Stock compensation expense increased by $17.5 million due to the additional amortization of stock options assumed from the NetScreen acquisition. General and administrative expenses increased $19.6 million in 2005 compared to 2004 and remained at 4% of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was driven by increases in personnel related expenses of $10.6 million and a $10.0 million patent related expense . The $10.0 million patent expense pertained to an agreement we entered into with a third party to avoid future disputes. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in stock compensation expense of $0.9 million compared to 2004 due primarily to the forfeitures of unvested options in 2005. General and administrative expenses increased $26.8 million in 2004 compared to 2003 and remained at 4% of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was driven by a $13.6 million increase in professional services and a $9.3 million increase in employee related expenses. Stock compensation expense increased by $2.0 million due to the additional amortization of stock options assumed from the NetScreen acquisition. Other Operating Expenses The following table shows other operating expenses (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Amortization of purchased intangible assets $ 85.2 $ 56.8 $ 20.7 In process research and development 11.0 27.5 Restructuring, impairments, and special charges, net (0.6 ) (5.1 ) 14.0 Integration costs 5.1 Amortization of Purchased Intangibles The amortization expense of intangible assets increased $28.4 million in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to the additional intangible assets from the five acquisitions completed in 2005. In addition, we recognized less than a full year of amortization expense for the intangible assets associated with the NetScreen acquisition in 2004. The amortization expense of intangible assets increased $36.1 million in 2004 compared to 2003 due to the intangible assets purchased in the NetScreen acquisition. See Note 3 in Item 8 for more information on our purchased intangible assets. 32 Table of Contents In Process Research and Development In 2005, a total of $11.0 million was charged to IPRD expense in connection with three of our five acquisitions during the year. Of the total Funk purchase price, $5.3 million was allocated to in process research and development (IPRD). Of the total Peribit purchase price, $3.8 million was allocated to IPRD. Of the total Kagoor purchase price, $1.9 million was allocated to IPRD. None of the Acorn or Redline purchase prices were allocated to IPRD. In 2004, $27.5 million was allocated to IPRD from the NetScreen acquisition and was expensed during the year. Projects that qualify as IPRD represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and which have no alternative future use. Technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to a beta phase working prototype in which there is no remaining risk relating to the development. At the time of acquisition, Funk, Peribit, Kagoor, and NetScreen had multiple IPRD efforts under way for certain current and future product lines. For Funk, these efforts included development of new versions for the Steel Belted Radius (SBR), SBR High Availability (HA), and Mobile IP Module (MIM) II products all related to the Radius product offering. IPRD as of the acquisition date also included development of new versions for Endpoint Assurance, Proxy (Remote Control), and Odyssey product families. At the time of the Funk acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts will be completed over the next four months at an estimated cost of approximately $0.9 million. For Peribit, these efforts included the development of next versions of software for the Sequence Reducer (SR) family, Sequence Mirror (SM) family, the Central Management System (CMS) products, as well as a hardware program for both the SR and SM families. At the time of the Peribit acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over the next twelve months at an estimated cost of approximately $2.3 million. For Kagoor, these efforts included a variety of signaling protocols and next generation products and operating systems. At the time of the Kagoor acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over the next eight months at an estimated cost of approximately $0.8 million. As of December 31, 2005, the estimated costs to complete the above research and development efforts were approximately $2.0 million. For NetScreen, these efforts included integrating secure routers with embedded encryption chips, as well as other functions and features such as next generation Internet Protocol (IP), wireless and digital subscriber line connectivity and voice over IP capability. We utilized the discounted cash flow (DCF) method to value the IPRD, using rates ranging from 20% to 25%, depending on the estimated useful life of the technology. In applying the DCF method, the value of the acquired technology was estimated by discounting to present value the free cash flows expected to be generated by the products with which the technology is associated, over the remaining economic life of the technology. To distinguish between the cash flows attributable to the underlying technology and the cash flows attributable to other assets available for generating product revenues, adjustments were made to provide for a fair return to fixed assets, working capital, and other assets that provide value to the product lines. At the time of the NetScreen acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over the next eighteen months at an estimated cost of approximately $25 million. As of December 31, 2005, there was no remaining costs associated with these research and development efforts Restructuring, Impairments, and Special Charges We implemented several restructuring plans from 2002 to 2004 as a result of product discontinuation and the acquisitions of Unisphere and NetScreen. Restructuring, impairments, and special charges in 2005 included adjustments of $6.6 million primarily related to our restructuring accruals when we re occupied a portion of the former NetScreen facility previously included in the acquisition related reserve. The credit was partially offset by a $5.9 million charge associated with the impairment of our purchased intangible assets related to Kagoor. Integration Costs We incurred immaterial integration expenses for the five 2005 acquisitions and approximately $5.1 million for the NetScreen acquisition in 2004. Integration expenses are incremental costs directly related to the integration of the two companies. The integration expenses consisted principally of facility related expenses, workforce related expenses and professional fees. We estimate that the majority of the integration costs related to our 2005 and 2004 acquisitions have been incurred and that there will be an immaterial amount of additional integration costs for these acquisitions in the foreseeable future. 33 Table of Contents Other Income and Expenses The following table shows other income and expenses (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Interest and other income $ 59.1 $ 28.2 $ 33.4 Interest and other expense (3.9 ) (5.4 ) (39.1 ) Write down of equity investments (0.4 ) (2.9 ) Loss on redemption of convertible subordinated notes (4.1 ) (1.1 ) Gain on sale of equity or available for sale investments 1.7 8.7 Interest and other income increased $30.9 million from 2004 to 2005 as a result of higher cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, and an increase in rates of return realized from our investments. Interest and other income decreased $5.2 million from 2003 to 2004. The decreases were the result of lower rates of return realized from our investments and less realized gains. Interest and other expenses decreased $1.5 million from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to the retirement of the subordinated notes during 2004, resulting in savings of $2.5 million, which was partially offset by foreign exchange related losses from balance sheet revaluation and bank fees. Interest expense decreased $33.7 million from 2003 to 2004, almost entirely due to interest saved from the retirement of our Subordinated Notes. We have certain minority equity investments in privately held companies that are carried at cost, adjusted for any impairment, as we do not have a controlling interest and do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over these companies. We wrote down these investments by $0.4 million and $2.9 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, for changes in market value that we believed were other than temporary. In 2005, we recorded a gain of $1.7 million in connection with a business combination transaction of a privately held company in our investment portfolio. Our cost basis of this equity investment was $1.0 million. During 2003, we sold some of our marketable equity securities classified as available for sale, which had a cost basis of $4.3 million, and recognized gains of $8.7 million. We spent $145.0 million, and $792.0 million during 2004 and 2003, respectively, to retire our Subordinated Notes. We recognized net losses of $4.1 million and $1.1 million during 2004 and 2003, respectively. The losses were a result of the difference between the carrying value of the Subordinated Notes at the time of their retirement, including unamortized debt costs, and the amount paid to extinguish such notes. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes increased to $148.2 million in 2005 from $83.3 million in 2004. The 2005 effective rate was 29.5% and differs from the federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to the benefit of tax credits and a reduction in deferred tax liabilities related to the repatriation dividend under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. We repatriated $225.0 million in 2005. We recorded a net tax benefit in 2005 of $19.7 million related to this repatriation dividend. The net tax benefit consists of a federal and state tax provision, net of federal benefit, of $9.7 million, offset by a tax benefit of $29.4 million related to an adjustment of deferred tax liabilities on un repatriated earnings. Provision for income taxes increased to $83.3 million in 2004 from $19.8 million in 2003. The 2004 effective rate was 38% and reflects taxes payable in certain foreign jurisdictions, the benefit of tax credits and the inability to benefit certain charges and losses. Segment Information A description of the products and services for each segment can be found in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We began to track financial information by our three operating segments during 2005 as our management structure and responsibilities began to measure the business based on management operating income. 34 Table of Contents We have included segment financial data for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 for comparative purposes. Financial information for each operating segment used by management to make financial decisions and allocate resources is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Net Revenues: Infrastructure $ 1,367.8 $ 975.7 $ 602.5 Service Layer Technologies 403.2 187.2 Service 293.0 173.1 98.9 Total net revenues $ 2,064.0 $ 1,336.0 $ 701.4 Operating Income: Management operating income: Infrastructure $ 483.2 $ 297.9 $ 76.1 Service Layer Technologies 13.4 1.0 Service 72.3 32.6 17.6 Total management operating income 568.9 331.5 93.7 Amortization of purchased intangible assets (85.2 ) (56.8 ) (20.7 ) Stock based compensation expense related to acquisitions (17.6 ) (44.0 ) (2.0 ) IPRD (11.0 ) (27.5 ) Restructuring, impairments, and special charges, net 0.6 5.1 (14.0 ) Patent expense (10.0 ) Integration costs (5.1 ) Total operating income $ 445.7 $ 203.2 $ 57.0 Infrastructure Operating Segment Infrastructure segment net revenues increased from 2004 to 2005 and from 2003 to 2004 due to the adoption and expansion of IP networks by our customers in order to reduce total operating costs and to be able to offer multiple services over a single network. The following table shows infrastructure revenue units recognized and ports shipped: Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Infrastructure chassis revenue units 9,828 7,102 4,785 Infrastructure ports shipped 153,763 114,543 73,471 We track infrastructure revenue units recognized and ports shipped to analyze customer trends and indicate areas of potential network growth. Our infrastructure product platforms are essentially modular, with the chassis serving as the base of the platform. Each chassis has a certain number of slots that are available to be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces. The modules are the components through which the router receives incoming packets of data from a variety of transmission media. The physical connection between a transmission medium and a module is referred to as a port. The number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the functionality and throughput offered by the module. Chassis revenue units represent the number of chassis on which revenue was recognized during the period. Management operating income increased from 2004 to 2005 and from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to increases in revenue as evident by the increase in chassis revenue units. The increase was partially offset by higher personnel related costs primarily related to support product innovation and the expansion of our sales channels. Service Layer Technologies Operating Segment SLT segment net revenues increased from 2004 to 2005 and from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to the NetScreen acquisition in 2004, and to a lesser extent, the Funk, Peribit, Redline, and Kagoor acquisitions and increases in the sales of firewall products in 2005. 35 Table of Contents Management operating income increased from 2004 to 2005 and from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to increases in net revenue, partially offset by increased expenses primarily related to product innovation and the expansion of our sales channels. Additionally, the purchase accounting adjustments related to the NetScreen acquisition negatively impacted the revenue and management operating results in 2004. Service Operating Segment Net service revenues increased in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to the growth in support services and, to a lesser degree, the growth in professional services. The growth in the support services was largely due to improved renewal rates and our growing installed base. Service management operating income increased as a result of the revenue growth experienced in the Infrastructure segment and the SLT segment, partially offset by increases in operating costs, primarily due to personnel related costs. However, in absolute dollars, employee related expenses increased as a result of increased headcounts. Expenses associated with spares also increased as a result of revenue growth. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview We have funded our business by issuing securities and through our operating activities. The following table shows our capital resources (in millions): As of December 31, 2005 2004 Cash and cash equivalents $ 918.4 $ 713.2 Short term investments 510.4 404.7 Long term investments 618.3 595.2 Restricted cash 66.1 31.2 Working capital 1,191.1 917.6 Working capital increased $273.5 million from 2004 to 2005 due to cash provided by operations of $642.9 million, partially offset by net cash used in investing activities. The significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, short term investments and accounts receivable, reduced by accounts payable, accrued liabilities and deferred revenue. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, and cash generated from operations will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations through at least the next 12 months. In addition, there are no transactions, arrangements, and other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of our requirements for capital resources. Cash Requirements and Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at December 31, 2005 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in millions): Less Than More than Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Operating leases, net of committed subleases (a) $ 191.6 $ 37.7 $ 61.4 $ 45.1 $ 47.4 Senior Notes (b) 400.0 400.0 Purchase commitments (c) 78.1 78.1 Other contractual obligations (d) 41.9 26.6 15.3 Total $ 711.6 $ 142.4 $ 476.7 $ 45.1 $ 47.4 (a) We occupy approximately 1.4 million square feet world wide under operating leases. The majority of our office space is in North America, including our corporate headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. Our longest lease expires in May 2014. 36 Table of Contents (b) Our principal commitment as of December 31, 2005 was our outstanding Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2008 (Senior Notes). The Senior Notes were issued in June 2003 and are senior unsecured obligations, rank on parity in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured debt, and rank senior to all of our existing and future debt that expressly provides that it is subordinated to the notes. The Senior Notes bear no interest, but are convertible into shares of our common stock, subject to certain conditions, at any time prior to maturity or their prior repurchase by Juniper Networks. The conversion rate is 49.6512 shares per each $1,000 principal amount of convertible notes, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The carrying value of the Senior Notes as of December 31, 2005 was $400.0 million. (c) We do not have firm purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers. In order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply, the contract manufacturers place non cancelable, non returnable (NCNR) orders, which were valued at $78.1 million as of December 31, 2005, based on our build forecasts. We do not take ownership of the components and the NCNR orders do not represent firm purchase commitments pursuant to our agreements with the contract manufacturers. The components are used by the contract manufacturers to build products based on purchase orders we have received from our customers. We do not incur a liability for products built by the contract manufacturer until it fulfills our customers order and the order ships. However, if the components go unused, we may be assessed carrying charges or obsolete charges. As of December 31, 2005, we had accrued $21.6 million based on our estimate of such charges. (d) Other Contractual obligations consist of the following: Escrow amount of $12.2 million related to the Funk acquisition for indemnity obligations. One half of the indemnity obligations will expire in January 2007 and the remaining one half will expire in June 2007. Also included is a contingent bonus payable, based on certain milestones, of $5 million, which will be earned over a period of one year. Escrow amount of $1.5 million related to the Acorn acquisition for indemnity obligations. The indemnity obligations will expire in May 2007. Also included is a contingent earn out payable to former Acorn stockholders, based on certain milestones, of up to $2.2 million, and bonus payable to employees related to continued employment of up to $1.0 million. Earn out and bonuses will be earned over a period of two years. Escrow amount related to the Redline and Kagoor acquisitions of $13.2 million and $6.8 million, respectively, for indemnity obligations. The indemnity obligations will expire in May 2006. In connection with the Peribit acquisition, 1.6 million shares of our common stock, with a fair value of $35.2 million as of acquisition date, have been held in escrow for indemnity obligations. We did not include this obligation in the above table since it is a non cash item. One half of the indemnity obligations will expire in July 2006 and the remaining one half will expire in January 2007. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $642.9 million, $439.4 million, and $178.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The cash provided by operating activities for each period was due to our net income adjusted by: Non cash charges of $304.0 million, $246.5 million, and $76.8 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, primarily for depreciation and amortization expenses, stock based compensation, tax benefit of employee stock option plans, in process research and development from acquisitions, debt issuance costs, loss on disposal of property and equipment, restructuring expense, and impairment charges associated with Kagoors purchased intangible assets. Non cash charges in 2005 also included a benefit from the reversal of NetScreens acquisition related liabilities and a loss due to the impairment of an equity investment, partially offset by gains associated with available for sale investments. In 2004, non cash charges also included a loss from the redemption of the Subordinated Notes and a loss due to the write down of equity investments. In 2003, non cash charges also included a loss from the redemption of the Subordinated Notes, offset by a gain from the sale of equity investment. 37 Table of Contents Changes in operating assets and liabilities of $(15.1) million, $57.2 million, and $62.5 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, were in the normal course of business. Net cash used during the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 was primarily attributable to increases in net accounts receivable of $68.0 million, prepaid expenses, other current assets, and other long term assets of $26.2 million, decreases in accrued warranty of $3.7 million, and decreases in other accrued liabilities of $42.6 million, partially offset by increases in deferred revenue of $64.3 million, accounts payable of $50.3 million, and accrued compensation of $10.9 million. Net cash provided during the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 was primarily attributable to increases in deferred revenue of $93.6 million, accrued compensation of $40.3 million, other accrued liabilities of $27.9 million, accounts payable of $29.4 million, and accrued warranty of $3.6 million, partially offset by increases in net accounts receivable of $81.4 million, and prepaid expenses, other current assets, and other long term assets of $56.3 million. Net cash used during the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 was primarily attributable to increase in deferred revenue of $29.2 million, accrued compensation of $17.5 million, accounts payable of $13.0 million, accrued warranty of $3.0 million, and other accrued liabilities of $2.5 million, partially offset by decreased in prepaid expenses, other current assets, and other long term assets of $3.1 million. Deferred revenue increased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increases in deferred service revenue as a result of the growth in the Service business, partially offset by revenue recognized from deferred product revenue. Deferred revenue increased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increases in deferred product revenue, and to a lesser degree, increases in deferred service revenue. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $583.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Net cash used in investing activities was $58.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net cash provided by investing activities was $300.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Investing activities included capital expenditures and the purchases and sale or maturities of available for sale securities, the purchase and sale of equity investments, and the acquisitions of businesses. Capital expenditures increased from 2004 to 2005 mainly due to new product developments and overseas expansions, and business acquisitions. Capital expenditures increased from 2003 to 2004 due to our business growth. Other investing activities include: $309.9 million of cash used in the acquisitions of Funk, Acorn, Peribit, Redline, and Kagoor during 2005, $34.8 million of restricted cash funded to escrow accounts in relation to the Funk, Acorn, Redline, and Kagoor acquisitions, and $9.8 million of investment in a private equity company during 2005; $40.9 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired in connection with the NetScreen acquisition during 2004, and; $30.8 million of restricted cash funded during 2003 to establish a trust to secure our indemnification obligations to certain directors and officers. Financing Activities Net cash provided in financing activities was $146.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Net cash used in financing activities was $33.4 million and $307.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Cash was provided during all periods from the issuance of common stock related to employee option exercises and stock purchase plans. We spent $145.0 million, and $792.0 million during 2004 and 2003, respectively, to retire our Subordinated Notes. We spent $63.6 million during 2004 to retire 2.9 million shares of our common stock. During 2003, we received net proceeds of $392.8 million from the issuance of the Senior Notes. In January and February of 2006, we repurchased 10,071,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $18.51 per share as part of our Common Stock Repurchase Program. The repurchase did not have a material impact on our liquidity. Recent Accounting Pronouncements On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS 123R), Share Based Payment, which is a revision of FASB Statement No. 123 (SFAS 123), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS 123R supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 (APB 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends FASB Statement No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. 38 Table of Contents Generally, the approach in SFAS 123R is similar to the approach described in SFAS 123. However, SFAS 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. We adopted SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006. SFAS 123R permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods: modified prospective method or modified retrospective method. We plan to adopt SFAS 123R using the modified prospective method, in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date (a) based on the requirements of SFAS 123R for all share based payments granted after the effective date and (b) based on the requirements of SFAS 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS 123R that remain unvested on the effective date. We will recognize in our results of operations the compensation cost for stock based awards issued after December 31, 2005 on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. For stock based awards issued prior to January 1, 2006, we amortize the related compensation costs using the graded vesting method. As permitted by SFAS 123, we currently account for share based payments to employees using APB 25 intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options. The adoption of the SFAS 123R fair value method will have a significant adverse impact on our reported results of operations because the stock based compensation expense will be charged directly against our reported earnings. The pre tax balance of unearned stock based compensation to be expensed in the period 2006 through 2010 related to share based awards unvested as of December 31, 2005, as previously calculated under the disclosure only requirements of SFAS 123, was approximately $98 million. If there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities, we may be required to accelerate, increase, or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense. To the extent that we grant additional equity securities to employees or assume unvested securities in connection with any acquisitions, our stock based compensation expense will be increased by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those additional grants or acquisitions. We anticipate we will grant additional employee stock options and restricted stock units in 2006. The fair value of these grants is not included in the amount above, as the impact of these grants cannot be predicted at this time because it depends on the number of share based payments granted and the then current fair values. SFAS 123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current standard. This requirement will likely reduce net operating cash flow and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. While we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future as they depend on, among other things, when employees exercise stock options, the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were $129.5 million, $66.0 million, and $10.8 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 123R 3, Transition Election and Accounting for Tax Effects. The guidance provides a simplified method to calculate the Additional Paid In Capital (APIC) pool for the beginning balance of excess tax benefits and the method of determining the subsequent impact on the pool of option awards that are outstanding and fully or partially vested upon the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment, beginning on January 1, 2006. In addition, this FSP addresses that when the alternative APIC pool calculation is used, tax benefits related to certain employee awards should be included as a cash flow from financing activities and a cash outflow from operating activities within the statements of cash flows. The FSP allows companies up to one year from the later of the adoption date of SFAS 123R or November 10, 2005 to evaluate the available transition alternatives and make a one time election. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of the new method provided by this guidance. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types and maturities. These securities are generally classified as available for sale and, consequently, are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings of our investment portfolio. We do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures. 39 Table of Contents The following table presents hypothetical changes in fair value of the financial instruments held at December 31, 2005 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates (in millions): Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Rate Decrease of X Basis Points (BPS) Fair Value as of Rate Increase of X BPS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) December 31, 2005 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS Government treasury and agencies $ 304.7 $ 302.9 $ 301.1 $ 299.3 $ 297.6 $ 295.8 $ 294.0 Corporate bonds and notes 646.4 643.2 640.2 637.1 633.9 630.8 627.7 Asset backed securities and other 372.8 372.2 371.5 370.9 370.2 369.6 368.9 Total $ 1,323.9 $ 1,318.3 $ 1,312.8 $ 1,307.3 $ 1,301.7 $ 1,296.2 $ 1,290.6 The following table presents hypothetical changes in fair value of the financial instruments held at December 31, 2004 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates (in millions): Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Rate Decrease of X Basis Points (BPS) Fair Value as of Rate Increase of X BPS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) December 31, 2004 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS Government treasury and agencies $ 247.0 $ 245.6 $ 244.3 $ 242.9 $ 241.6 $ 240.2 $ 238.9 Corporate bonds and notes 538.7 535.5 532.3 529.1 525.8 522.6 519.4 Asset backed securities and other 354.2 353.8 353.4 353.0 352.6 352.2 351.8 Total $ 1,139.9 $ 1,134.9 $ 1,130.0 $ 1,125.0 $ 1,120.0 $ 1,115.0 $ 1,110.1 These instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading. The modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (BPS), 100 BPS and 150 BPS, which are representative of the historical movements in the Federal Funds Rate. Foreign Currency Risk and Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts It is our policy to use derivatives to partially offset our market exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. We uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate transaction gains and losses generated by certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. These derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other income (expense). Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are largely offset by re measurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. These foreign exchange contracts have maturities between one and two months. Periodically, we use foreign currency forward and or option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to operating expenses. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of less than one year. The effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, and upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction, is subsequently reclassified into the consolidated statements of operations line item to which the hedged transaction relates. We record any ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments, which was immaterial during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, in other income (expense) in our results of operations. 40 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This Annual Report on Form 10 K (Report), including the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward looking statements regarding future events and the future results of our Company that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the industry in which 22 Table of Contents we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management. Words such as expects, anticipates, targets, goals, projects, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. These forward looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this Report under the section entitled Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I and elsewhere, and in other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), specifically the most recent reports on Form 10 Q. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason. The following discussion is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingencies. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, sales returns, warranty costs, allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long term assets, especially goodwill and intangible assets, contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges, tax, and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Overview of the Results of Operations To aid in understanding our operating results for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, we believe an overview of the significant events that affected those periods and a discussion of the nature of our operating expenses is helpful. Significant Events Business Acquisitions We completed a total of six acquisitions in the three years ended December 31, 2005. The main purposes of these acquisitions were to expand our product portfolio and customer base. The results of the following acquisitions have been included in our consolidated statements of operations beginning on their respective acquisition dates. The following is a summary of our acquisitions: Year Ended December 31, 2005: Funk Software, Inc. (Funk) acquired on December 1, 2005: Developed and sold products designed to protect the integrity of the network by verifying users and devices that meet an organizations security policies before granting network access. Acorn Packet Solutions, Inc. (Acorn) acquired on October 20, 2005: Developed and sold products that enable migration from circuit based networks to more flexible and cost effective IP networks. Peribit Networks, Inc. (Peribit) acquired on July 1, 2005: Developed and sold products that enhance wide area network (WAN) optimization and application delivery. Redline Networks, Inc. (Redline) acquired on May 2, 2005: Developed and sold application front end platforms for enterprise data centers and public web sites. Kagoor Networks, Inc. (Kagoor) acquired on May 1, 2005: Developed and sold session border control products to enhance voice over Internet Protocol networking for communication carriers. 23 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2004: NetScreen Technologies, Inc. (NetScreen) acquired on April 16, 2004: Developed and sold a broad array of integrated network security solutions for enterprises, carriers, and government entities. Acquisition Related Liabilities In connection with our acquisitions, we recorded liabilities associated with severance, future lease, and other obligations. The initial liabilities were recorded as part of the acquisitions and did not impact the Statements of Operations. The following is a summary of these liabilities: In 2005, we recorded liabilities of $4.5 million for the five acquisitions of that year, primarily related to future lease, severance, and other contractual obligations. As of December 31, 2005, there was $2.6 million remaining to be paid primarily related to future lease, severance, and other contractual obligations. At the time of the NetScreen acquisition in 2004, we accrued $21.3 million primarily related to professional services, severance and facility charges. There is approximately $3.1 million remaining to be paid, primarily for facility leases that extend through 2008. At the time of the acquisition of Unisphere Networks, Inc. (Unisphere) in 2002, we accrued $14.8 million primarily related to professional services, severance and facility charges. There is approximately $1.2 million remaining to be paid, primarily for facility leases that extend through March 2011. Segments As a result of these six acquisitions, we now offer two categories of products as well as services organized into the following three operating segments: Infrastructure: Products consist of the original Juniper Networks router portfolio and Acorn products. Service Layer Technologies (SLT): Products include the Funk, Peribit, Redline, Kagoor, and NetScreen products. Service: Delivers world wide services to customers of the Infrastructure and SLT segments. Acceleration of Unvested and Out of the Money Employee Stock Options On December 16, 2005, our Board of Directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of certain unvested and out of the money stock options that had an exercise price per share equal to or greater than $22.00, all of which were previously granted under our stock option plans and that were outstanding on December 16, 2005. Options to purchase approximately 21.2 million shares of common stock or 49.3% of our total outstanding unvested options on December 16, 2005 were accelerated. The options accelerated excluded options previously granted to certain employees, including all of our executive officers and our directors. In addition, the acceleration of the unvested and out of the money options was accompanied by restrictions imposed on any shares purchased through the exercise of accelerated options. Those restrictions will prevent the sale of any such shares prior to the date such shares would have originally vested had the optionee been employed on such date, whether or not the optionee is actually an employee at that time. The purpose of the acceleration was to enable us to avoid recognizing compensation expense associated with these options in future periods in our Statements of Operations pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123R (SFAS 123R). Under SFAS 123R, we will apply the expense recognition provisions relating to stock options beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. In approving the acceleration, our Board considered its impact on future financial results, stockholder value and employee retention. We believe that the acceleration of the unvested and out of the money options was in the best interest of stockholders as it will reduce our reported compensation expense in future periods in light of these accounting regulations. As a result of the acceleration, we expect to reduce the pre tax stock option expense we otherwise would have been required to record by approximately $153 million subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 123R beginning in 2006. The acceleration of the vesting of these options did not result in a charge to our results of operations in 2005. 24 Table of Contents The rules regarding option expensing are relatively recent. It is possible that changes to existing rules, adoption of new rules or the promulgation of rulings or interpretations by the Securities and Exchange Commission or other bodies, could cause the ultimate accounting treatment of our options to vary from our current expectations, and if applied to periods prior to such changes or rulings, could result in changes to historically reported financial information. Restructuring and Other Related Charges Restructuring Reserves We initiated restructuring plans to eliminate certain duplicative activities, focus on strategic product and customer bases, reduce cost structure and better align product and operating expenses with existing general economic conditions. The following is a summary of our restructuring plans charged to operating expenses in the Statements of Operations: In 2004, we implemented a restructuring plan at the time of the acquisition of NetScreen. We initially recorded a charge of approximately $0.4 million primarily related to workforce reduction costs, which has been completely paid out as of December 31, 2005. In 2003, we implemented a restructuring plan, under which we announced that we would no longer develop our G series CMTS products and recorded a charge that was comprised of workforce reduction costs, non inventory asset impairment, costs associated with vacating facilities and terminating contracts and other related costs. We initially recorded a charge of approximately $14.0 million that was comprised of workforce reduction costs, non inventory asset impairment, vacating facilities costs, the costs associated with termination of contracts and other related costs. As of December 31, 2005, approximately $1.4 million remained unpaid primarily for a facility lease that extends through July 2008. In 2002, we implemented a restructuring plan at the time of the Unisphere acquisition. We initially recorded a charge of $14.9 million, of which approximately $0.7 million remained unpaid as of December 31, 2005, primarily for facility leases that extend through April 2009. During 2005 and 2004, we adjusted our restructuring reserves primarily due to changes in lease and sublease assumptions as our needs changed as a result of our recent acquisitions and as the real estate markets changed. See Note 5 in Item 8 for a complete description of all restructuring charges and the amounts remained to be paid. Impairment Charges We evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flow the asset is expected to generate. If an asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment charge to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. We assess the recoverability of our long lived and intangible assets by determining whether the unamortized balances can be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows of the related assets. The amount of impairment, if any, is measured based on projected discounted future net cash flows. In December 2005, we recorded an impairment charge of $5.9 million related to certain Kagoor purchased intangibles as a result of a significant reduction in our forecasted revenue associated with Kagoor products. Debt Retirement Through December 31, 2004, we paid a total of $937.0 million to retire all of our remaining 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes due March 15, 2007 (Subordinated Notes). These transactions affected our cash and cash equivalents, investments, interest income and interest expense. Tax Repatriation We repatriated $225.0 million under the American Jobs Creation Act (Jobs Act) in 2005. We recorded a net tax benefit in 2005 of $19.7 million related to this repatriation dividend. The net tax benefit consists of a federal and state tax 25 Table of Contents provision, net of federal benefit, of $9.7 million, offset by a tax benefit of $29.4 million related to an adjustment of deferred tax liabilities on un repatriated earnings. Nature of Expenses We have an extensive distribution channel in place that we use to target new customers and increase sales. We have made substantial investments in our distribution channel during 2005 and 2004. Most of our manufacturing, repair and supply chain operations are outsourced to independent contract manufacturers; accordingly, most of our cost of revenues consists of payments to our independent contract manufacturers for the standard product costs. The independent contract manufacturers produce our products using design specifications, quality assurance programs and standards that we establish. Controls around manufacturing, engineering and documentation are conducted at our facilities in Sunnyvale, California and Westford, Massachusetts. Our independent contract manufacturers have facilities primarily in Canada, China, Malaysia, and the United States. We generally do not own the components and title to products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon shipment. The contract manufacturers procure components based on our build forecasts and if actual component usage is lower than our forecasts, we may be, and have been in the past, liable for carrying or obsolete material charges. Employee related costs have historically been the primary driver of our operating expenses and we expect this trend to continue. Employee related costs include items such as wages, commissions, bonuses, vacation, benefits and travel. We added over 420 and 900 employees in 2005 and 2004, respectively, across all functions as a result of acquisitions. We had 4,145, 2,948, and 1,553 employees as of December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Facility and information technology departmental costs are allocated to other departments based on headcount. These departmental costs have increased each of the last two years due to increases in headcount and facility leases resulting from acquisitions and additional infrastructure systems to support our growth. We expect these costs to stabilize in 2006. Research and development expenses include: the costs of developing our products from components to prototypes to finished products, outside services for such services as certifications of new products, and expenditures associated with equipment used for testing. Several components of our research and development effort require significant expenditures, such as the development of new components and the purchase of prototype equipment, the timing of which can cause quarterly variability in our expenses. We expense our research and development costs as they are incurred. We plan to increase our investment in research and development during 2006 compared to 2005 to further advance our competitive advantage. Sales and marketing expenses include costs for promoting our products and services, demonstration equipment and advertisements. These costs vary quarter to quarter depending on revenues, product launches and marketing initiatives. We plan to further develop our distribution channel in 2006 in an effort to expand and grow our presence in new markets, serving both private and public networks with a full portfolio of networking products. General and administrative expenses include professional fees, bad debt provisions and other corporate expenses. Professional fees include legal, audit, tax, accounting and certain corporate strategic services. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period. We regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical 26 Table of Contents experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from managements estimates. To the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future results of operations will be affected. We believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery or performance has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Evidence of an arrangement generally consists of customer purchase orders and, in certain instances, sales contracts or agreements. Shipping terms and related documents, or written evidence of customer acceptance, when applicable, are used to verify delivery or performance. We assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and the customers payment history to us. On arrangements where products and services are bundled, we determine whether the deliverables are separable into multiple units of accounting. We allocate the total fee on such arrangements to the individual deliverables either based on their relative fair values or using the residual method, as circumstances dictate. We then recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with its policies for product and service revenue recognition. Our ability to recognize revenue in the future may be affected if actual selling prices are significantly less than fair value. In addition, our ability to recognize revenue in the future could be impacted by conditions imposed by our customers. For sales to direct end users and value added resellers, we recognize product revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss, which is generally upon shipment. It is our practice to identify an end user prior to shipment to a value added reseller. For our end users and value added resellers, there are no significant obligations for future performance such as rights of return or pricing credits. A portion of our sales are made through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits and or rights of return. We recognize product revenue on sales made through these distributors upon sell through as reported to us by the distributors. We recognize revenue from service contracts as services are completed or ratably over the period of the obligation. We record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments, such as rebates and price protection, in the same period that the related revenue is recorded. The amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns and price protection credits, specific criteria included in rebate agreements, and other factors known at the time. Additional reductions to revenue would result if actual product returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of any of our customers was to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of its ability to make payments, additional allowances could be required. Contract Manufacturer Liabilities. We outsource most of our manufacturing, repair and supply chain management operations to our independent contract manufacturers and a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of payments to them. Our independent contract manufacturers procure components and manufacture our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts are based on our estimates of future demand for our products, which are in turn based on historical trends and an analysis from our sales and marketing organizations, adjusted for overall market conditions. We establish reserves for carrying charges and obsolete material charges for excess components purchased based on historical trends. If the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast, which may be caused by factors outside of our control, we have contractual liabilities and exposures with the independent contract manufacturers, such as carrying costs and obsolete material exposures, which would have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability. Warranty Reserve. We generally offer a one year warranty on all of our hardware products and a 90 day warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the products. We establish reserves for estimated product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized. Although we engage in extensive product 27 Table of Contents quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, use of materials and technical labor costs and associated overhead incurred in correcting any product failure. Should actual product failure rates, use of materials or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, additional warranty reserves could be required, which could reduce gross margins. Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets. Goodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. The amounts and useful lives assigned to other intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization, and the amount assigned to in process research and development is expensed immediately. The value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, could be impacted by future adverse changes such as: (i) future declines in our operating results, (ii) a decline in the valuation of technology company stocks, including the valuation of our common stock, (iii) significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or the networking industry or (iv) failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results. We evaluate these assets on an annual basis as of November 1 or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. In the process of our annual impairment review, we use the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as the market approach to determine the fair value of our intangible assets. Significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation. The estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business. It is possible, however, that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect. If our actual results, or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses, are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets, we could incur additional impairment charges. Income Taxes. Estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences and carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. Deferred tax assets attributable to tax deductions related to stock options are not considered realizable prior to their utilization on tax returns, at which point a current tax savings results and equity is credited for such savings. We regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income based on the realization criteria set forth under SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe to be more likely than not realizable. We believe it is more likely than not that forecasted income together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Similarly, if we subsequently realize deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation allowance would be reversed, resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings or a decrease in goodwill in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities may result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimate of tax liabilities is less than the amount ultimately assessed, a further charge to expense would result. Litigation and Settlement Costs. From time to time, we are involved in disputes, litigation and other legal actions. We are aggressively defending our current litigation matters, however, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and we cannot assure you that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation and or substantial settlement charges. In addition the resolution of any future intellectual property litigation may require us to make royalty payments, which could adversely impact gross margins in future periods. If any of those events were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We record a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency when both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the range of loss can be reasonably estimated. However the actual liability in any such litigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to record additional expenses. 28 Table of Contents Loss Contingencies. We are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required. Results of Operations The increases in revenues, cost of expenses, and operating expenses in 2005 compared to 2004 are attributable to, to a certain extent, the inclusion of the results of operations from Funk, Acorn, Peribit, Redline, and Kagoor for part of 2005, and NetScreen for the full year in 2005. Revenues, cost of revenues, and operating expenses were significantly greater during 2004 compared to 2003 due to the NetScreen acquisition. Net Revenues The following table shows net revenues and net revenues as a percentage of total net revenues (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Product net revenues $ 1,771.0 86 % $ 1,162.9 87 % $ 602.5 86 % Service net revenues 293.0 14 % 173.1 13 % 98.9 14 % Total net revenues $ 2,064.0 100 % $ 1,336.0 100 % $ 701.4 100 % Our total net revenues increased to $2,064.0 million in 2005 and represents a growth of 54% from 2004. Our total net revenues increased to $1,336.0 million in 2004 and represents a growth of 90% from 2003. Product Net Revenues The $608.1 million or 52% increase in our net product revenue from 2004 to 2005 was primarily a result of the adoption and expansion of IP networks by our customers in order to reduce total operating costs and to be able to offer multiple services over a single network and as a result of the expansion of our product portfolio through acquisitions and internal development. During 2005, we recognized $32.7 million of product revenue from product shipments made to end users and value added resellers that were deferred as of December 31, 2004. Infrastructure products accounted for $1,367.8 million or 77% of our total product net revenues during 2005. Infrastructure product net revenue grew by 40% from 2004 to 2005, primarily due to the increase in revenues from service providers and enterprises. SLT products accounted for $403.2 million or 23% of our total product net revenues during 2005. Our SLT product revenue was primarily driven by the increased demand by the enterprise market. Our higher net revenues in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to the revenue growth from Security products. Additionally, the acquisitions made in 2005 enabled us to cross sell infrastructure, security, and application acceleration products to existing customer bases. An analysis of the change in revenue by Infrastructure and SLT segments, and the change in units, can be found below in the section titled Segment Information. Net product revenue increased from 2003 to 2004 primarily as a result of the increase in Infrastructure product shipments to meet the customers capital expenditures demands, and to a lesser extent, due to SLT net revenue related to the NetScreen acquisition. Service Net Revenues Net service revenues increased $119.9 million or 69% from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to the growth in support services and, to a lesser degree, the growth in professional services. The growth in the support services was largely due to improved renewal rates and our growing installed base. We recognize revenue from service contracts as the services are completed or ratably over the period of the obligation. A majority of our service revenue is earned from customers who purchase our products and enter into service contracts that are typically for one year renewable periods. 29 Table of Contents Net service revenues increased from 2003 to 2004 primarily as a result of the increase in installed base of customers and products. Total Net Revenues The following table shows net revenue by geographic region (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Americas: United States $ 879.0 43 % $ 561.5 42 % $ 268.2 38 % Other 53.9 2 % 47.6 4 % 28.0 4 % Total Americas 932.9 45 % 609.1 46 % 296.2 42 % Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) 610.1 30 % 380.5 28 % 186.4 27 % Asia Pacific: Japan 204.8 10 % 155.7 12 % 102.4 15 % Other 316.2 15 % 190.7 14 % 116.4 16 % Total Asia Pacific 521.0 25 % 346.4 26 % 218.8 31 % Total $ 2,064.0 100 % $ 1,336.0 100 % $ 701.4 100 % We continue to experience varying distribution of revenue among our three geographic theaters, and we expect this trend to continue. Net revenue in the United States as a percentage of total net revenue increased in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to the growth driven by increased demand within the service provider and enterprise markets. Net revenue in EMEA as a percentage of total net revenue increased in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to strength across the region, including Finland, Greece, Italy, Poland, and the United Kingdom. Net revenue in Japan as a percentage of total net revenue decreased in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to completion by customers of several network expansion projects and a pause in the build out of their next generation network, or NGN. Net revenue in other Asia Pacific countries as a percentage of total net revenue remained fairly consistent with prior years. In 2004, net revenue in the Americas region grew as a percentage of total net revenue due to the improvement in customer spending in the United States. Siemens accounted for greater than 10% of our net product and service revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003. Ericsson accounted for greater than 10% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003. We expect that our largest customers, as well as key strategic partners, will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenue in 2006 and for the foreseeable future. Cost of Revenues The following table shows cost of product and service revenues and the related gross margin (GM) percentages (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2005 GM% 2004 GM% 2003 GM% Cost of product revenues $ 506.1 71 % $ 318.1 73 % $ 200.6 67 % Cost of service revenues 146.8 50 % 95.3 45 % 56.7 43 % Total cost of revenues $ 652.9 68 % $ 413.4 69 % $ 257.3 63 % Reclassifications have been made to product costs in 2004 and 2003 to include related stock compensation expense to conform to the current year presentation. The two percentage points decrease in product gross margins from 2004 to 2005 was primarily due to increasing competition as certain of our products have become more mature in their product cycles. As we have expanded our market share and entered more markets since 2004, we have begun to experience increased price competition. This price competition has been limited to date, as evidenced by our increase in revenue dollars compared to the year ago period as well as relatively comparable product gross margins from year to year. We expect to see increasing price competition and downward pressure on our product gross margins in the future. Nevertheless, higher product revenue volume contributed to the increased gross margin by $420.1 million, or 50% in 2005 when compared to 2004. 30 Table of Contents The six percentage points increase in product gross margins from 2003 to 2004 was primarily due to cost cutting initiatives that resulted in standard costs and manufacturing support costs increasing at a lesser rate than product net revenues in terms of absolute dollars for the same periods. In addition, the standard margins on the original NetScreen products are more favorable than the standard margins on the Infrastructure products and NetScreens acquisition in 2004 contributed to the increases compared to prior year. The improvement in gross margins was also a result of a $16.0 million reduction in carrying and obsolescence charges from 2003 to 2004 as our historical charges paid to the contract manufacturers decreased. The increase in gross margins was partially offset by acquisition charges related to the NetScreen acquisition, which increased cost of product revenues by $5.5 million, for an inventory fair value adjustment and the amortization of the order backlog intangible asset. Service gross margins increased five percentage points from 2004 to 2005 and was primarily attributable to a larger revenue increase when compared to the increase in headcount, outside services, and spares purchases, all of which were needed to support the growing installed base. Total employee related expenses as a percentage of service revenue for 2005 decreased to 22% compared to 26% for 2004. Nevertheless, in absolute dollars, total service related costs increased in 2005 compared to 2004: employee related expenses increased $20.2 million, and outside service expenses increased by $17.5 million as a result of increased headcount during 2005. In addition, expense associated with spares increased by $7.1 million. Service gross margins increased two percentage points from 2003 to 2004 as a result of improved efficiencies and economies of scale that were a direct result of a larger installed base, and thus a more leveraged service organization. This increased leverage was evidenced by the fact that total employee related expenses decreased as a percentage of service revenue: 26% for 2004 and 27% for 2003; however, in absolute dollars, employee related expenses increased $18.5 million from 2003 to 2004. The increases in absolute dollars were due to the NetScreen acquisition. In addition, in absolute dollars, outside services costs increased $9.3 million from 2003 to 2004, primarily due to the NetScreen acquisition. Finally, the costs associated with spare parts decreased as a percent of service revenue from 2003 to 2004 and remained approximately the same in terms of absolute dollars. Research and Development, Sales and Marketing and General and Administrative Expenses The following table shows research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses amounts and as a percentage of total net revenues (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Research and development $ 355.4 17 % $ 259.9 19 % $ 178.0 25 % Sales and marketing 439.6 21 % 320.0 24 % 146.0 21 % General and administrative 74.8 4 % 55.2 4 % 28.4 4 % Reclassifications were made to the 2004 and 2003 amounts to include related stock compensation expense to conform to the current year presentation. Research and development expenses increased $95.5 million in 2005 compared to 2004, but decreased as a percent of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases in personnel related expenses of $66.4 million, facility related expenses of $14.1 million, engineering and testing expenses of $12.6 million, equipment related expenses of $8.5 million, and depreciation of $5.1 million. The increases in personnel related expenses in 2005 were primarily due to additional hires in the engineering organization, including those from the five acquisitions. The increase is partially offset by the decrease in stock compensation expense of $11.6 million compared to 2004 as a result of forfeitures of unvested options in 2005. We continue to invest in both stand alone as well as integrated products in order to satisfy our customer needs. In addition, we invested and expanded on our global research and development efforts, specifically in China and India. Research and development expenses increased $81.9 million in 2004 compared to 2003, but decreased as a percent of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to employee related expenses increasing $42.4 million year over year as a result of the NetScreen acquisition. The increase in research and development expenses was also the result of a $6.5 million increase in expensed equipment primarily used in test activities and a $5.6 million increase in prototype expense. The increase in expensed equipment was due to additional research and development requirements resulting from the NetScreen acquisition. Prototype expenses are closely tied to product launches because of the testing and certification needed before a product can be offered to the public, and the amounts reported in a given period can vary depending on the product being developed and the timing 31 Table of Contents of the release. Stock compensation expense increased by $19.6 million due to the additional amortization of stock options assumed from the NetScreen acquisition. Sales and marketing expenses increased $119.6 million in 2005 compared to 2004 and decreased as a percent of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases in personnel related expenses of $97.3 million, increases in marketing related activities of $10.9 million, and increases in equipment related expenses of $2.6 million. Personnel related expenses increased in 2005 primarily due to additional hires, including acquisitions, to support the expansion of our distribution channels and customer base, as well as to support the larger portfolio of products. Marketing related activities increased primarily as a result of specific activities designed to expand and improve our distribution channels, introduction of new products, and increase awareness of our existing products to a broader range of customers. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in stock compensation expense of $12.9 million compared to 2004 due primarily to the forfeitures of unvested options in 2005. Sales and marketing expenses increased $174.0 million in 2004 compared to 2003 and increased as a percent of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to employee related expenses increasing $104.7 million year over year as a result of the NetScreen acquisition and the increase in revenue. Marketing related expenses increased $22.3 million due to the NetScreen acquisition, the branding of the combined companies and the development of a distribution channel and channel sales. Outside services increased $7.0 million due to professional services related to marketing activities. In addition, demonstration equipment increased $6.4 million due to the NetScreen acquisition and the related purchase of Security demonstration products for our direct sales force and resellers. Demonstration equipment is expensed immediately and is closely tied to product launches. Stock compensation expense increased by $17.5 million due to the additional amortization of stock options assumed from the NetScreen acquisition. General and administrative expenses increased $19.6 million in 2005 compared to 2004 and remained at 4% of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was driven by increases in personnel related expenses of $10.6 million and a $10.0 million patent related expense . The $10.0 million patent expense pertained to an agreement we entered into with a third party to avoid future disputes. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in stock compensation expense of $0.9 million compared to 2004 due primarily to the forfeitures of unvested options in 2005. General and administrative expenses increased $26.8 million in 2004 compared to 2003 and remained at 4% of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was driven by a $13.6 million increase in professional services and a $9.3 million increase in employee related expenses. Stock compensation expense increased by $2.0 million due to the additional amortization of stock options assumed from the NetScreen acquisition. Other Operating Expenses The following table shows other operating expenses (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Amortization of purchased intangible assets $ 85.2 $ 56.8 $ 20.7 In process research and development 11.0 27.5 Restructuring, impairments, and special charges, net (0.6 ) (5.1 ) 14.0 Integration costs 5.1 Amortization of Purchased Intangibles The amortization expense of intangible assets increased $28.4 million in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to the additional intangible assets from the five acquisitions completed in 2005. In addition, we recognized less than a full year of amortization expense for the intangible assets associated with the NetScreen acquisition in 2004. The amortization expense of intangible assets increased $36.1 million in 2004 compared to 2003 due to the intangible assets purchased in the NetScreen acquisition. See Note 3 in Item 8 for more information on our purchased intangible assets. 32 Table of Contents In Process Research and Development In 2005, a total of $11.0 million was charged to IPRD expense in connection with three of our five acquisitions during the year. Of the total Funk purchase price, $5.3 million was allocated to in process research and development (IPRD). Of the total Peribit purchase price, $3.8 million was allocated to IPRD. Of the total Kagoor purchase price, $1.9 million was allocated to IPRD. None of the Acorn or Redline purchase prices were allocated to IPRD. In 2004, $27.5 million was allocated to IPRD from the NetScreen acquisition and was expensed during the year. Projects that qualify as IPRD represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and which have no alternative future use. Technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to a beta phase working prototype in which there is no remaining risk relating to the development. At the time of acquisition, Funk, Peribit, Kagoor, and NetScreen had multiple IPRD efforts under way for certain current and future product lines. For Funk, these efforts included development of new versions for the Steel Belted Radius (SBR), SBR High Availability (HA), and Mobile IP Module (MIM) II products all related to the Radius product offering. IPRD as of the acquisition date also included development of new versions for Endpoint Assurance, Proxy (Remote Control), and Odyssey product families. At the time of the Funk acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts will be completed over the next four months at an estimated cost of approximately $0.9 million. For Peribit, these efforts included the development of next versions of software for the Sequence Reducer (SR) family, Sequence Mirror (SM) family, the Central Management System (CMS) products, as well as a hardware program for both the SR and SM families. At the time of the Peribit acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over the next twelve months at an estimated cost of approximately $2.3 million. For Kagoor, these efforts included a variety of signaling protocols and next generation products and operating systems. At the time of the Kagoor acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over the next eight months at an estimated cost of approximately $0.8 million. As of December 31, 2005, the estimated costs to complete the above research and development efforts were approximately $2.0 million. For NetScreen, these efforts included integrating secure routers with embedded encryption chips, as well as other functions and features such as next generation Internet Protocol (IP), wireless and digital subscriber line connectivity and voice over IP capability. We utilized the discounted cash flow (DCF) method to value the IPRD, using rates ranging from 20% to 25%, depending on the estimated useful life of the technology. In applying the DCF method, the value of the acquired technology was estimated by discounting to present value the free cash flows expected to be generated by the products with which the technology is associated, over the remaining economic life of the technology. To distinguish between the cash flows attributable to the underlying technology and the cash flows attributable to other assets available for generating product revenues, adjustments were made to provide for a fair return to fixed assets, working capital, and other assets that provide value to the product lines. At the time of the NetScreen acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over the next eighteen months at an estimated cost of approximately $25 million. As of December 31, 2005, there was no remaining costs associated with these research and development efforts Restructuring, Impairments, and Special Charges We implemented several restructuring plans from 2002 to 2004 as a result of product discontinuation and the acquisitions of Unisphere and NetScreen. Restructuring, impairments, and special charges in 2005 included adjustments of $6.6 million primarily related to our restructuring accruals when we re occupied a portion of the former NetScreen facility previously included in the acquisition related reserve. The credit was partially offset by a $5.9 million charge associated with the impairment of our purchased intangible assets related to Kagoor. Integration Costs We incurred immaterial integration expenses for the five 2005 acquisitions and approximately $5.1 million for the NetScreen acquisition in 2004. Integration expenses are incremental costs directly related to the integration of the two companies. The integration expenses consisted principally of facility related expenses, workforce related expenses and professional fees. We estimate that the majority of the integration costs related to our 2005 and 2004 acquisitions have been incurred and that there will be an immaterial amount of additional integration costs for these acquisitions in the foreseeable future. 33 Table of Contents Other Income and Expenses The following table shows other income and expenses (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Interest and other income $ 59.1 $ 28.2 $ 33.4 Interest and other expense (3.9 ) (5.4 ) (39.1 ) Write down of equity investments (0.4 ) (2.9 ) Loss on redemption of convertible subordinated notes (4.1 ) (1.1 ) Gain on sale of equity or available for sale investments 1.7 8.7 Interest and other income increased $30.9 million from 2004 to 2005 as a result of higher cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, and an increase in rates of return realized from our investments. Interest and other income decreased $5.2 million from 2003 to 2004. The decreases were the result of lower rates of return realized from our investments and less realized gains. Interest and other expenses decreased $1.5 million from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to the retirement of the subordinated notes during 2004, resulting in savings of $2.5 million, which was partially offset by foreign exchange related losses from balance sheet revaluation and bank fees. Interest expense decreased $33.7 million from 2003 to 2004, almost entirely due to interest saved from the retirement of our Subordinated Notes. We have certain minority equity investments in privately held companies that are carried at cost, adjusted for any impairment, as we do not have a controlling interest and do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over these companies. We wrote down these investments by $0.4 million and $2.9 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, for changes in market value that we believed were other than temporary. In 2005, we recorded a gain of $1.7 million in connection with a business combination transaction of a privately held company in our investment portfolio. Our cost basis of this equity investment was $1.0 million. During 2003, we sold some of our marketable equity securities classified as available for sale, which had a cost basis of $4.3 million, and recognized gains of $8.7 million. We spent $145.0 million, and $792.0 million during 2004 and 2003, respectively, to retire our Subordinated Notes. We recognized net losses of $4.1 million and $1.1 million during 2004 and 2003, respectively. The losses were a result of the difference between the carrying value of the Subordinated Notes at the time of their retirement, including unamortized debt costs, and the amount paid to extinguish such notes. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes increased to $148.2 million in 2005 from $83.3 million in 2004. The 2005 effective rate was 29.5% and differs from the federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to the benefit of tax credits and a reduction in deferred tax liabilities related to the repatriation dividend under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. We repatriated $225.0 million in 2005. We recorded a net tax benefit in 2005 of $19.7 million related to this repatriation dividend. The net tax benefit consists of a federal and state tax provision, net of federal benefit, of $9.7 million, offset by a tax benefit of $29.4 million related to an adjustment of deferred tax liabilities on un repatriated earnings. Provision for income taxes increased to $83.3 million in 2004 from $19.8 million in 2003. The 2004 effective rate was 38% and reflects taxes payable in certain foreign jurisdictions, the benefit of tax credits and the inability to benefit certain charges and losses. Segment Information A description of the products and services for each segment can be found in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We began to track financial information by our three operating segments during 2005 as our management structure and responsibilities began to measure the business based on management operating income. 34 Table of Contents We have included segment financial data for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 for comparative purposes. Financial information for each operating segment used by management to make financial decisions and allocate resources is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Net Revenues: Infrastructure $ 1,367.8 $ 975.7 $ 602.5 Service Layer Technologies 403.2 187.2 Service 293.0 173.1 98.9 Total net revenues $ 2,064.0 $ 1,336.0 $ 701.4 Operating Income: Management operating income: Infrastructure $ 483.2 $ 297.9 $ 76.1 Service Layer Technologies 13.4 1.0 Service 72.3 32.6 17.6 Total management operating income 568.9 331.5 93.7 Amortization of purchased intangible assets (85.2 ) (56.8 ) (20.7 ) Stock based compensation expense related to acquisitions (17.6 ) (44.0 ) (2.0 ) IPRD (11.0 ) (27.5 ) Restructuring, impairments, and special charges, net 0.6 5.1 (14.0 ) Patent expense (10.0 ) Integration costs (5.1 ) Total operating income $ 445.7 $ 203.2 $ 57.0 Infrastructure Operating Segment Infrastructure segment net revenues increased from 2004 to 2005 and from 2003 to 2004 due to the adoption and expansion of IP networks by our customers in order to reduce total operating costs and to be able to offer multiple services over a single network. The following table shows infrastructure revenue units recognized and ports shipped: Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Infrastructure chassis revenue units 9,828 7,102 4,785 Infrastructure ports shipped 153,763 114,543 73,471 We track infrastructure revenue units recognized and ports shipped to analyze customer trends and indicate areas of potential network growth. Our infrastructure product platforms are essentially modular, with the chassis serving as the base of the platform. Each chassis has a certain number of slots that are available to be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces. The modules are the components through which the router receives incoming packets of data from a variety of transmission media. The physical connection between a transmission medium and a module is referred to as a port. The number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the functionality and throughput offered by the module. Chassis revenue units represent the number of chassis on which revenue was recognized during the period. Management operating income increased from 2004 to 2005 and from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to increases in revenue as evident by the increase in chassis revenue units. The increase was partially offset by higher personnel related costs primarily related to support product innovation and the expansion of our sales channels. Service Layer Technologies Operating Segment SLT segment net revenues increased from 2004 to 2005 and from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to the NetScreen acquisition in 2004, and to a lesser extent, the Funk, Peribit, Redline, and Kagoor acquisitions and increases in the sales of firewall products in 2005. 35 Table of Contents Management operating income increased from 2004 to 2005 and from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to increases in net revenue, partially offset by increased expenses primarily related to product innovation and the expansion of our sales channels. Additionally, the purchase accounting adjustments related to the NetScreen acquisition negatively impacted the revenue and management operating results in 2004. Service Operating Segment Net service revenues increased in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to the growth in support services and, to a lesser degree, the growth in professional services. The growth in the support services was largely due to improved renewal rates and our growing installed base. Service management operating income increased as a result of the revenue growth experienced in the Infrastructure segment and the SLT segment, partially offset by increases in operating costs, primarily due to personnel related costs. However, in absolute dollars, employee related expenses increased as a result of increased headcounts. Expenses associated with spares also increased as a result of revenue growth. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview We have funded our business by issuing securities and through our operating activities. The following table shows our capital resources (in millions): As of December 31, 2005 2004 Cash and cash equivalents $ 918.4 $ 713.2 Short term investments 510.4 404.7 Long term investments 618.3 595.2 Restricted cash 66.1 31.2 Working capital 1,191.1 917.6 Working capital increased $273.5 million from 2004 to 2005 due to cash provided by operations of $642.9 million, partially offset by net cash used in investing activities. The significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, short term investments and accounts receivable, reduced by accounts payable, accrued liabilities and deferred revenue. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, and cash generated from operations will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations through at least the next 12 months. In addition, there are no transactions, arrangements, and other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of our requirements for capital resources. Cash Requirements and Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at December 31, 2005 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in millions): Less Than More than Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Operating leases, net of committed subleases (a) $ 191.6 $ 37.7 $ 61.4 $ 45.1 $ 47.4 Senior Notes (b) 400.0 400.0 Purchase commitments (c) 78.1 78.1 Other contractual obligations (d) 41.9 26.6 15.3 Total $ 711.6 $ 142.4 $ 476.7 $ 45.1 $ 47.4 (a) We occupy approximately 1.4 million square feet world wide under operating leases. The majority of our office space is in North America, including our corporate headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. Our longest lease expires in May 2014. 36 Table of Contents (b) Our principal commitment as of December 31, 2005 was our outstanding Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2008 (Senior Notes). The Senior Notes were issued in June 2003 and are senior unsecured obligations, rank on parity in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured debt, and rank senior to all of our existing and future debt that expressly provides that it is subordinated to the notes. The Senior Notes bear no interest, but are convertible into shares of our common stock, subject to certain conditions, at any time prior to maturity or their prior repurchase by Juniper Networks. The conversion rate is 49.6512 shares per each $1,000 principal amount of convertible notes, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The carrying value of the Senior Notes as of December 31, 2005 was $400.0 million. (c) We do not have firm purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers. In order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply, the contract manufacturers place non cancelable, non returnable (NCNR) orders, which were valued at $78.1 million as of December 31, 2005, based on our build forecasts. We do not take ownership of the components and the NCNR orders do not represent firm purchase commitments pursuant to our agreements with the contract manufacturers. The components are used by the contract manufacturers to build products based on purchase orders we have received from our customers. We do not incur a liability for products built by the contract manufacturer until it fulfills our customers order and the order ships. However, if the components go unused, we may be assessed carrying charges or obsolete charges. As of December 31, 2005, we had accrued $21.6 million based on our estimate of such charges. (d) Other Contractual obligations consist of the following: Escrow amount of $12.2 million related to the Funk acquisition for indemnity obligations. One half of the indemnity obligations will expire in January 2007 and the remaining one half will expire in June 2007. Also included is a contingent bonus payable, based on certain milestones, of $5 million, which will be earned over a period of one year. Escrow amount of $1.5 million related to the Acorn acquisition for indemnity obligations. The indemnity obligations will expire in May 2007. Also included is a contingent earn out payable to former Acorn stockholders, based on certain milestones, of up to $2.2 million, and bonus payable to employees related to continued employment of up to $1.0 million. Earn out and bonuses will be earned over a period of two years. Escrow amount related to the Redline and Kagoor acquisitions of $13.2 million and $6.8 million, respectively, for indemnity obligations. The indemnity obligations will expire in May 2006. In connection with the Peribit acquisition, 1.6 million shares of our common stock, with a fair value of $35.2 million as of acquisition date, have been held in escrow for indemnity obligations. We did not include this obligation in the above table since it is a non cash item. One half of the indemnity obligations will expire in July 2006 and the remaining one half will expire in January 2007. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $642.9 million, $439.4 million, and $178.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The cash provided by operating activities for each period was due to our net income adjusted by: Non cash charges of $304.0 million, $246.5 million, and $76.8 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, primarily for depreciation and amortization expenses, stock based compensation, tax benefit of employee stock option plans, in process research and development from acquisitions, debt issuance costs, loss on disposal of property and equipment, restructuring expense, and impairment charges associated with Kagoors purchased intangible assets. Non cash charges in 2005 also included a benefit from the reversal of NetScreens acquisition related liabilities and a loss due to the impairment of an equity investment, partially offset by gains associated with available for sale investments. In 2004, non cash charges also included a loss from the redemption of the Subordinated Notes and a loss due to the write down of equity investments. In 2003, non cash charges also included a loss from the redemption of the Subordinated Notes, offset by a gain from the sale of equity investment. 37 Table of Contents Changes in operating assets and liabilities of $(15.1) million, $57.2 million, and $62.5 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, were in the normal course of business. Net cash used during the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 was primarily attributable to increases in net accounts receivable of $68.0 million, prepaid expenses, other current assets, and other long term assets of $26.2 million, decreases in accrued warranty of $3.7 million, and decreases in other accrued liabilities of $42.6 million, partially offset by increases in deferred revenue of $64.3 million, accounts payable of $50.3 million, and accrued compensation of $10.9 million. Net cash provided during the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 was primarily attributable to increases in deferred revenue of $93.6 million, accrued compensation of $40.3 million, other accrued liabilities of $27.9 million, accounts payable of $29.4 million, and accrued warranty of $3.6 million, partially offset by increases in net accounts receivable of $81.4 million, and prepaid expenses, other current assets, and other long term assets of $56.3 million. Net cash used during the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 was primarily attributable to increase in deferred revenue of $29.2 million, accrued compensation of $17.5 million, accounts payable of $13.0 million, accrued warranty of $3.0 million, and other accrued liabilities of $2.5 million, partially offset by decreased in prepaid expenses, other current assets, and other long term assets of $3.1 million. Deferred revenue increased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to increases in deferred service revenue as a result of the growth in the Service business, partially offset by revenue recognized from deferred product revenue. Deferred revenue increased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to increases in deferred product revenue, and to a lesser degree, increases in deferred service revenue. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $583.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Net cash used in investing activities was $58.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net cash provided by investing activities was $300.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Investing activities included capital expenditures and the purchases and sale or maturities of available for sale securities, the purchase and sale of equity investments, and the acquisitions of businesses. Capital expenditures increased from 2004 to 2005 mainly due to new product developments and overseas expansions, and business acquisitions. Capital expenditures increased from 2003 to 2004 due to our business growth. Other investing activities include: $309.9 million of cash used in the acquisitions of Funk, Acorn, Peribit, Redline, and Kagoor during 2005, $34.8 million of restricted cash funded to escrow accounts in relation to the Funk, Acorn, Redline, and Kagoor acquisitions, and $9.8 million of investment in a private equity company during 2005; $40.9 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired in connection with the NetScreen acquisition during 2004, and; $30.8 million of restricted cash funded during 2003 to establish a trust to secure our indemnification obligations to certain directors and officers. Financing Activities Net cash provided in financing activities was $146.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Net cash used in financing activities was $33.4 million and $307.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Cash was provided during all periods from the issuance of common stock related to employee option exercises and stock purchase plans. We spent $145.0 million, and $792.0 million during 2004 and 2003, respectively, to retire our Subordinated Notes. We spent $63.6 million during 2004 to retire 2.9 million shares of our common stock. During 2003, we received net proceeds of $392.8 million from the issuance of the Senior Notes. In January and February of 2006, we repurchased 10,071,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $18.51 per share as part of our Common Stock Repurchase Program. The repurchase did not have a material impact on our liquidity. Recent Accounting Pronouncements On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS 123R), Share Based Payment, which is a revision of FASB Statement No. 123 (SFAS 123), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS 123R supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 (APB 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends FASB Statement No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. 38 Table of Contents Generally, the approach in SFAS 123R is similar to the approach described in SFAS 123. However, SFAS 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. We adopted SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006. SFAS 123R permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods: modified prospective method or modified retrospective method. We plan to adopt SFAS 123R using the modified prospective method, in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date (a) based on the requirements of SFAS 123R for all share based payments granted after the effective date and (b) based on the requirements of SFAS 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS 123R that remain unvested on the effective date. We will recognize in our results of operations the compensation cost for stock based awards issued after December 31, 2005 on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. For stock based awards issued prior to January 1, 2006, we amortize the related compensation costs using the graded vesting method. As permitted by SFAS 123, we currently account for share based payments to employees using APB 25 intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options. The adoption of the SFAS 123R fair value method will have a significant adverse impact on our reported results of operations because the stock based compensation expense will be charged directly against our reported earnings. The pre tax balance of unearned stock based compensation to be expensed in the period 2006 through 2010 related to share based awards unvested as of December 31, 2005, as previously calculated under the disclosure only requirements of SFAS 123, was approximately $98 million. If there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities, we may be required to accelerate, increase, or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense. To the extent that we grant additional equity securities to employees or assume unvested securities in connection with any acquisitions, our stock based compensation expense will be increased by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those additional grants or acquisitions. We anticipate we will grant additional employee stock options and restricted stock units in 2006. The fair value of these grants is not included in the amount above, as the impact of these grants cannot be predicted at this time because it depends on the number of share based payments granted and the then current fair values. SFAS 123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current standard. This requirement will likely reduce net operating cash flow and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. While we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future as they depend on, among other things, when employees exercise stock options, the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were $129.5 million, $66.0 million, and $10.8 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 123R 3, Transition Election and Accounting for Tax Effects. The guidance provides a simplified method to calculate the Additional Paid In Capital (APIC) pool for the beginning balance of excess tax benefits and the method of determining the subsequent impact on the pool of option awards that are outstanding and fully or partially vested upon the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment, beginning on January 1, 2006. In addition, this FSP addresses that when the alternative APIC pool calculation is used, tax benefits related to certain employee awards should be included as a cash flow from financing activities and a cash outflow from operating activities within the statements of cash flows. The FSP allows companies up to one year from the later of the adoption date of SFAS 123R or November 10, 2005 to evaluate the available transition alternatives and make a one time election. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of the new method provided by this guidance. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types and maturities. These securities are generally classified as available for sale and, consequently, are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings of our investment portfolio. We do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures. 39 Table of Contents The following table presents hypothetical changes in fair value of the financial instruments held at December 31, 2005 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates (in millions): Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Rate Decrease of X Basis Points (BPS) Fair Value as of Rate Increase of X BPS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) December 31, 2005 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS Government treasury and agencies $ 304.7 $ 302.9 $ 301.1 $ 299.3 $ 297.6 $ 295.8 $ 294.0 Corporate bonds and notes 646.4 643.2 640.2 637.1 633.9 630.8 627.7 Asset backed securities and other 372.8 372.2 371.5 370.9 370.2 369.6 368.9 Total $ 1,323.9 $ 1,318.3 $ 1,312.8 $ 1,307.3 $ 1,301.7 $ 1,296.2 $ 1,290.6 The following table presents hypothetical changes in fair value of the financial instruments held at December 31, 2004 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates (in millions): Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Rate Decrease of X Basis Points (BPS) Fair Value as of Rate Increase of X BPS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) December 31, 2004 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS Government treasury and agencies $ 247.0 $ 245.6 $ 244.3 $ 242.9 $ 241.6 $ 240.2 $ 238.9 Corporate bonds and notes 538.7 535.5 532.3 529.1 525.8 522.6 519.4 Asset backed securities and other 354.2 353.8 353.4 353.0 352.6 352.2 351.8 Total $ 1,139.9 $ 1,134.9 $ 1,130.0 $ 1,125.0 $ 1,120.0 $ 1,115.0 $ 1,110.1 These instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading. The modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (BPS), 100 BPS and 150 BPS, which are representative of the historical movements in the Federal Funds Rate. Foreign Currency Risk and Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts It is our policy to use derivatives to partially offset our market exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. We uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate transaction gains and losses generated by certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. These derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other income (expense). Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are largely offset by re measurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. These foreign exchange contracts have maturities between one and two months. Periodically, we use foreign currency forward and or option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to operating expenses. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of less than one year. The effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, and upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction, is subsequently reclassified into the consolidated statements of operations line item to which the hedged transaction relates. We record any ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments, which was immaterial during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, in other income (expense) in our results of operations. 40 Table of Contents
