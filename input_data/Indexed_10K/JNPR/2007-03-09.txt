There were no material changes to the previously reported net stockholders equity and other balance sheet data as of December 31, 2003 and 2002. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This Annual Report on Form 10 K (Report), including the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward looking statements regarding future events and the future results of our Company that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the industry in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management. Words such as expects, anticipates, targets, goals, projects, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. These forward looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this Report under the section entitled Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I and elsewhere, and in other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), specifically the most recent reports on Form 10 Q. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason. The information below has been adjusted to reflect the restatement of our financial results which is more fully described in the Explanatory Note immediately preceding Part I, Item 1, and in Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K. The following discussion is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingencies. In the course of operating our business, we routinely make decisions as to the timing of the payment of invoices, the collection of receivables, the manufacturing and shipment of products, the fulfillment of orders, the purchase of supplies, and the building of inventory and spare parts, among other matters. Each of these decisions has some impact on the financial results for any given period. In making these decisions, we consider various factors including contractual obligations, customer satisfaction, competition, internal and external financial targets and expectations, and financial planning objectives. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to sales returns, pricing credits, warranty costs, allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long term assets, especially goodwill and intangible assets, contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges, assumptions used in the valuation of stock based compensation, and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Overview of the Results of Operations To aid in understanding our operating results for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, we believe an overview of the significant events that affected those periods and a discussion of the nature of our operating expenses is helpful. Significant Events Business and Market Environment The year of 2006 marked our 10th anniversary and a year of considerable progress which culminated with record revenue results for both the year and in the fourth quarter. In addition, Standard Poors (SP) has added the company to the SP 500 Index as of the close of trading on June 1, 2006. During 2006, there has been and continues to be consolidation in the telecommunications industry (for example, the acquisitions of ATT Inc., MCI, Inc. and BellSouth Corporation) and consolidation among the large vendors of telecommunications equipment and services, such as the combination of Alcatel S.A. and Lucent Technologies Inc. and the acquisition of Redback Networks, Inc. by Ericsson. We believe our innovation and market momentum have also allowed us to build partnerships with other market leaders, which we announced in 2006, including Avaya Inc., Microsoft Corporation, NEC and Symantec Corporation. Our total installed base of products has grown to approximately $8.6 billion across more than 100 countries worldwide. These numbers are the result of more than 400,000 units shipped to over 20,000 customers thanks to the help of more than 9,000 partners since our inception. 31 Table of Contents In 2006, we had major Next Generation Network (NGN) wins in the service provider marketplace, helping us to achieve an overall installed base of over 2,500 units of the T series in North America, EMEA and selected countries in Asia. We saw significant success in carriers selecting equipment for the core of their networks designed to provide multiple types of services, such as voice, data and video, so called multi play, a strategic focus for us and an important growth opportunity for the future. We have also seen an increased level of interest in our SLT portfolio and a growing number of service providers using our SLT products for both managed service offerings and outsourced solutions for their customers. In fact, the number of service providers buying our SLT products increased 50% from 2005 to 2006. We successfully delivered the products we planned to deliver in 2006 despite the risks associated with the long length of product development, testing and acceptance cycles involved with these products in these markets. We have made good progress in 2006 and we are building a product portfolio in a market with solid demand for IP infrastructure. Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements In this Form 10 K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006 (the 2006 Form 10 K), we are restating our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005 and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 as a result of an independent stock option investigation commenced by the Board of Directors and Audit Committee. This restatement is more fully described in Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements, to Consolidated Financial Statements and in Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. This 2006 Form 10 K will also reflect the restatement of Selected Consolidated Financial Data in Item 6 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002. In addition, we are restating our unaudited quarterly financial information and financial statements for interim periods of 2005, and unaudited condensed financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2006. Financial information included in the reports on Form 10 K, Form 10 Q and Form 8 K filed by us prior to August 10, 2006, and the related opinions of our independent registered public accounting firm, and all earnings press releases and similar communications issued by us, prior to August 10, 2006 should not be relied upon and are superseded in their entirety by this Report and other reports on Form 10 Q and Form 8 K filed by us with the SEC on or after August 10, 2006. Stock Option Investigation On May 22, 2006, we issued a press release and Form 8 K announcing that we had received a request for information relating to our stock option granting practices from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York. In the same press release and Form 8 K, we announced that our Board of Directors (the Board) had directed the Boards Audit Committee, comprised of outside directors, to conduct a review of our stock option granting practices. On May 24, 2006, we received a letter from the SEC indicating that the SEC was conducting an inquiry regarding Juniper Networks. The investigation was conducted with the assistance of independent counsel and forensic accountants (collectively the Investigative Team). The investigation focused on all stock option grants made to all employees, officers, directors and consultants during the period following our initial public offering (IPO) on June 24, 1999 to May 23, 2006 (the relevant period). In addition, the Audit Committee investigation involved testing and analyses of our hiring, termination, leave of absence, grant notification and exercise practices regarding stock options and certain issues regarding grants made before the IPO. The scope of the investigation did not include a review of options granted by companies acquired by us. All of the companies acquired by us, with one exception, were privately held companies. None of the acquisitions was accounted for as a pooling of interests. All of the acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method as provided by Statement of Financial Standards No. 141, Business Combinations and its predecessor Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16, Business Combinations. In connection with the investigation, more than 785,000 physical and electronic documents were reviewed and 35 current and former directors, officers, employees and agents were interviewed. On December 20, 2006, we announced key findings of the Audit Committee. Key findings of the Audit Committee are: There were numerous instances in which grant dates were chosen with the benefit of hindsight as to the price of our stock, so as to give favorable exercise prices. In this regard, the Audit Committee identified serious concerns regarding the actions of certain former management in connection with the stock option granting process Formal documentation of stock option grants often lagged the referenced grant date Grants were made by persons or committees who did not have the proper authority to make the grants in question Management failed to exercise sufficient responsibility for the stock option granting process 32 Table of Contents Our CEO, Scott Kriens, received two stock option awards whose measurement dates for financial accounting purposes differ from the recorded grant dates for such awards. However, both options were exchanged and cancelled unexercised in 2001 as part of a company wide option re pricing program. Mr. Kriens has not exercised any stock options since 1998, approximately nine months before our IPO There were substantial changes to our granting procedures after June 9, 2003 and again in 2005. No grants subsequent to 2004 required new measurement dates There was no improper conduct by our Compensation Committee or Board of Directors regarding the granting of stock options by those bodies Our Audit Committee expressed their continuing confidence in Scott Kriens and the current management of the Company Consistent with the accounting literature and recent guidance from the SEC, we have organized the grants during the relevant period into categories based on grant type and the process by which the grant was finalized. We analyzed the evidence from the Audit Committees investigation related to each category including, but not limited to, physical documents, electronic documents, underlying electronic data about documents, and witness interviews. Based on the relevant facts and circumstances, we applied the then appropriate accounting standards to determine, for every grant within each category, the proper measurement date. If the measurement date was not the originally assigned grant date, accounting adjustments were made as required, resulting in stock based compensation expense and related tax effects. Grants made by our Board of Directors or Compensation Committee to Officers or Directors We have concluded that the measurement dates of several grants to executive officers who were reporting persons as that term is defined under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (Officers) and members of the Board of Directors made between June 1999 and June 2003 were incorrect. In general, during the relevant period, the Board or the Compensation Committee of the Board made grants to Officers and directors. Grants were sometimes approved at meetings of these bodies or by action by unanimous written consent. There were several instances in which grants to Officers or directors were given grant dates (and corresponding exercise prices) prior to the date on which formal corporate action making the grant was taken. In general, this appears to have been done to make the grant date coincide with either a specific event, such as the appointment or re election of a director or with the purported date options were granted to non Officers. In these cases, we have determined that the correct measurement date is the date on which our Board or Compensation Committee took the action to approve the grant. We also identified instances in which grants to Officers were granted effective upon a future event, such as the commencement of employment or closing of an acquisition. In these cases, we have determined that the date of the future event is the correct measurement date for such grants. We also identified instances where grants to Officers were made by a body not authorized by our Board to make grants to Officers and were subsequently ratified by our Board. In those instances, we determined that the correct measurement date is the date on which such ratification occurred. In connection with the application of these measurement principles, and after accounting for forfeitures, we have adjusted the measurement of compensation cost for options covering 5.6 million shares of common stock resulting in an incremental stock based compensation expense of $80.3 million on a pre tax basis over the respective awards vesting terms. In addition, there was one other grant to an Officer where approval of such grant was not reflected in minutes of a meeting or an action by unanimous written consent of our Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee. For that grant, the measurement date was determined based on the terms of the Officers offer letter and the date his employment commenced. With respect to that grant, we have adjusted the measurement of compensation cost for options covering 1.5 million shares of common stock resulting in an incremental stock based compensation expense of $6.5 million on a pre tax basis over the awards vesting terms after accounting for forfeitures. Grants to Non Officers We have concluded that the measurement dates of a large number of grants to non Officers during the period between June 1999 and December 2004 were incorrect. Our practice has been to grant stock options, except where prohibited, to nearly all full time employees in connection with joining us. To facilitate the granting of options to our rapidly growing workforce, the Board of Directors established a Stock Option Committee to grant options to non Officer employees. Between June 1999 and June 2003, the dates for a large number of grants made by our Stock Option Committee were chosen with the benefit of hindsight as to the price of our stock, so as to give favorable exercise prices. Moreover, our Stock Option Committees process for finalizing and documenting these grants was often completed after the originally assigned grant date. Beginning with grants dated June 20, 2003, we implemented a number of new procedures and policies regarding the granting of options to non Officer employees. After that, we have concluded that the pattern of consciously looking back for the most favorable dates for the employees ceased. However, the documentation and written approvals of grant dates still generally trailed the recorded grant dates. Based on all available facts and circumstances, the originally recorded 33 Table of Contents measurement dates for the grants made by our Stock Option Committee during the period from July 1999 through December 2004 can not be relied upon in isolation as the correct measurement dates. In 2005, we made additional changes to our procedures. No grants in 2005 and 2006 required new measurement dates. APB 25 defines the measurement date for determining stock based compensation expense as the first date on which both (1) the number of shares that an individual employee is entitled to receive and (2) the option or purchase price, are known. Throughout the relevant period, the Companys stock administration department entered the option grant information for grants made by the Stock Option Committee into its Equity Edge stock administration system. This system was used to monitor and administer our stock option program. The data in Equity Edge were sent on a regular basis to designated brokers, allowing grantees to view their options information in their accounts via the Internet. For grants made by the Stock Option Committee between June 1999 and December 2004, where there is no other reliable objective evidence pointing to an earlier single specific date that the number of shares and the individuals entitled to receive them and the price had become final, we have determined the Equity Edge entry date to be the most reliable measurement date for calculating additional stock based compensation expense under APB 25. Using this measurement date, and after accounting for forfeitures, we have adjusted the measurement of compensation cost for options covering 74.2 million shares of common stock resulting in an incremental stock based compensation expense of $636.7 million on a pre tax basis over the respective awards vesting terms. In many of the cases where the Equity Edge entry date was used as the measurement date, the formal Stock Option Committee granting documentation (consisting of unanimous written consents or minutes and related lists of recipients, amounts and types of awards) was not created or completed until a later date. Because the awards listed in the formal granting documentation did not differ from the grants entered into Equity Edge, the notice of the awards was made available to employees prior to the creation or completion of the granting documents, and because the completion of the documentation was treated as perfunctory, we determined that the Equity Edge entry date was the proper measurement date under APB 25 rather than the date the Stock Option Committee granting documentation was completed. In a number of cases, there was reliable objective evidence pointing to a single specific date that the number of shares and the individuals entitled to receive them and the price had become final. Such evidence primarily consisted of electronic data indicating that the granting instrument and schedule were created prior to the Equity Edge entry date. We also relied on other evidence such as emails or written agreements to determine the date certain options became final. Such evidence was used to determine the measurement dates for options for which we have adjusted the measurement of compensation cost for options covering 27.9 million shares of common stock resulting in incremental stock based compensation expense of $141.2 million on a pre tax basis over the respective awards vesting terms. We also concluded that there were instances in which clerical errors or omissions regarding the persons to receive an award or the number of options to be granted were corrected after the date of award. In the case of most additions made to correct omissions and other corrections that were not reflected on the grant documentation at the time of the applicable grant date or in documentation existing at the time of grant, we have determined that a new measurement date should be established. We considered whether certain of such changes or additions should give rise to variable accounting treatment and concluded that such treatment was not appropriate because the grants represented independent decisions or events rather than a continuation or modification of the other grants. We believe that the correct measurement date for these grants is the date Stock Administration entered the correction or addition into Equity Edge, except where objective evidence identifies an earlier date on which the correction was approved. After accounting for forfeitures, we have adjusted the measurement of compensation cost for options covering 1.3 million shares of common stock resulting in incremental stock based compensation of $11.9 million on a pre tax basis over the respective awards vesting terms. Stock Option Grant Modifications Connected with Terminations or Leaves of Absences and Other Matters Compensation expense was also recognized as a result of modifications that were made to certain employee option grant awards in connection with certain employees terminations or leaves of absence. Typically such modifications related to extensions of the time employees could exercise options following their termination of employment or that enabled the employee to vest in additional shares in relation to a leave of absence. For example, in connection with reductions in work force in 2001 and 2002, we increased the period for affected employees to exercise their options from 30 days to 90 days. We have incremental stock based compensation expense associated with such terminations or leaves of absence of $20.0 million on a pre tax basis in the period of modification. Compensation expense of $0.2 million on a pre tax basis was also recognized as a result of non employee grants to consultants in exchange for services and other matters. 34 Table of Contents Judgment In light of the significant judgment used in establishing revised measurement dates, alternate approaches to those used by us could have resulted in different compensation expense charges than those recorded by us in the restatement. We considered various alternative approaches. For example, in those cases where the formal documentation of a grant was completed after the date the grant was entered in Equity Edge, an alternative measurement date to using the Equity Edge entry date could be the creation date of the documentation. Changing the measurement dates for grants made by our Stock Option Committee from the Equity Edge entry date to the later of the electronic data creation date of the unanimous written consent or the related schedule of grants would cause the pre tax compensation charges of $636.7 million discussed above to increase by approximately $10.6 million. Conversely, where we established a new measurement date prior to the Equity Edge entry date for grants made by our Stock Option Committee to non Officers based on other evidence, such as the electronic data indicating the initial creation date of the granting instrument and schedule, an alternative measurement date could be the Equity Edge entry date. Changing the measurement dates for these grants by the Stock Option Committee from a date prior to Equity Edge entry date to the Equity Edge entry would increase the $141.2 million of the pre tax compensation charges discussed above by approximately $37.7 million. We believe that the approaches we used were the most appropriate under the circumstances. Summary of Stock Based Compensation Adjustments We adjusted the measurement dates for options covering a total of 110.5 million, or 76%, of the 146.0 million shares of common stock covered by options granted during the relevant period. The impact from on the consolidated statement of operations from recognizing stock based compensation expense through December 31, 2006 resulting from the investigation is summarized as follows (in millions): Fiscal Year Pre Tax Expense After Tax Expense 1998 $ $ 1999 15.3 15.3 2000 283.3 201.6 2001 513.1 488.1 2002 48.0 48.0 2003 19.4 8.6 Subtotal 879.1 761.6 2004 10.9 7.5 2005 4.7 3.3 Total $ 894.7 $ 772.4 In addition to the $894.7 million recognized through fiscal 2005, $2.1 million of unamortized deferred compensation remained as of December 31, 2005, bringing the total incremental impact from the investigation to approximately $896.8 million. As required by SFAS 123R, which was adopted on January 1, 2006, the unamortized deferred compensation of $2.1 million has been reclassified to additional paid in capital, along with the unamortized deferred compensation for stock options assumed from past acquisitions, in our consolidated balance sheet. Beginning in 2006, the incremental amortization resulting from the investigation is included in stock based compensation expense under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R). The incremental stock based compensation expense from the restatement of employee stock options was $0.6 million, on a pre tax basis, for the year ended December 31, 2006. Other Matters After considering all available evidence, primarily the then current 2005 operating projections of future income, which remain appropriate, we have concluded that the previously recorded valuation allowance related to the tax benefit of stock options deductions should have been reversed in the fourth quarter of 2005. Accordingly, we decreased the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2005 by $158.0 million with a corresponding credit to additional paid in capital. The remaining valuation allowance balance of $40.6 million relates to capital losses which will carry forward to offset future capital gains. Additionally, we misclassified the tax benefit from deductions from stock options assumed in acquisitions. Accordingly, we have reduced additional paid in capital for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 by $6.0 million and $18.5 million, respectively, with a corresponding decrease to goodwill. The total reduction to both additional paid in capital and goodwill as of December 31, 2005 was $24.5 million. 35 Table of Contents Because virtually all holders of options issued by us were not involved in or aware of the incorrect pricing, we have taken and intend to take actions to deal with certain adverse tax consequences that may be incurred by the holders of certain incorrectly priced options. The primary adverse tax consequence is that incorrectly priced stock options vesting after December 31, 2004 may subject the option holder to a penalty tax under IRC Section 409A (and, as applicable, similar penalty taxes under California and other state tax laws). We recorded $10.1 million as other charges in operating expense for 2006 in relation to these items and other tax related items. We expect to incur future charges to resolve the adverse tax consequences of incorrectly priced options We misclassified the gains and losses from the retirement of our treasury shares in fiscal 2004. Accordingly, we reduced our retained earnings (accumulated deficit) as of December 31, 2004 and 2005 by $63.6 million with a corresponding increase to additional paid in capital. The impact of recognizing additional stock compensation and other adjustments on each component of stockholders equity at the end of each year is summarized as follows (in millions): Common Stock Additional Paid In Deferred Stock Net Impact to Fiscal Year Capital Compensation Accumulated Deficit Stockholders Equity 1998 $ $ $ $ 1999 215.3 (200.0 ) (15.3 ) 2000 479.6 (278.0 ) (201.6 ) 2001 74.9 413.2 (488.1 ) 2002 21.5 26.5 (48.0 ) 2003 (10.6 ) 19.2 (8.6 ) Subtotal 780.7 (19.1 ) (761.6 ) 2004 41.3 11.3 (71.1 ) (18.5 ) 2005 204.6 5.7 (3.3 ) 207.0 Total $ 1,026.6 $ (2.1 ) $ (836.0 ) $ 188.5 NASDAQ Listing Status In August 2006, we received a NASDAQ Staff Determination letter stating that, as a result of the delayed filing of our quarterly report on Form 10 Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 (the Second Quarter Form 10 Q), we were not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing as set forth in Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) and were therefore subject to delisting from the NASDAQ Global Select Market. In November 2006, we received an additional letter from NASDAQ of similar substance related to our Form 10 Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 (the Third Quarter Form 10 Q). In December 2006, the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel granted our request for continued listing, provided that we file a written summary of our audit committees findings with NASDAQ as well as the Second Quarter Form 10 Q, the Third Quarter Form 10 Q and any required restatements with the SEC on or before February 12, 2007. In January 2007, we received a notice from the NASDAQ Listing and Hearings Review Council which advised us that any delisting determination by the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel has been stayed pending further review by the Review Council. We have been given until March 30, 2007 to submit additional information to assist the Review Council in their assessment of our listing status. On February 20, 2007, we filed a written summary of our Audit Committees findings with NASDAQ. In addition, on March 9, 2007, we filed the Second Quarter Form 10 Q and the Third Quarter Form 10 Q with the SEC. We consider that the filing of these materials has remedied our non compliance with Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14), subject to NASDAQs affirmative completion of its compliance protocols and its notification to us accordingly. However, if NASDAQ disagrees with our position or if the SEC disagrees with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported, or not reported, the financial impact of past stock option grants, there could be further delays in filing subsequent SEC reports or other actions that might result in delisting of our common stock from the NASDAQ Global Select Market. Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets We recorded a $1,280.0 million non cash goodwill impairment charge in our consolidated statements of operations within the SLT segment to adjust the estimated carrying value of our goodwill for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006. The impairment of goodwill was primarily attributable to the decline in the Companys market capitalization that occurred over a period of approximately six months prior to the impairment review and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in the forecasted future cash flows used in the income approach. Future impairment indicators, including further declines in our market capitalization or a decrease in revenue or profitability levels, could require additional impairment charges to be recorded. 36 Table of Contents We evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flow the asset is expected to generate. If an asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment charge to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. We assess the recoverability of our long lived and intangible assets by determining whether the unamortized balances can be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows of the related assets. The amount of impairment, if any, is measured based on projected discounted future net cash flows. In 2006 and 2005, we recorded impairment charges of $3.4 million and $5.9 million, respectively, related to certain Kagoor purchased intangibles as a result of a significant reduction in our forecasted revenue associated with the session border control products. Stock Based Compensation We adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R effective January 1, 2006, using the modified prospective transition method and, therefore, have not revised prior periods results. During 2006, we issued stock options to the members of our Board (outside directors) and stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and shares of common stock pursuant to equity incentive plans. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, our Board of Directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of certain unvested and out of the money stock options that had an exercise price per share equal to or greater than $22.00, all of which were previously granted under our stock option plans and that were outstanding on December 16, 2005. The options accelerated excluded options previously granted to certain employees, including all of the executive officers and the Board of Directors of Juniper Networks. Under SFAS 123R, we recorded pre tax stock based compensation expense of $87.6 million in 2006 compared to $22.3 million in 2005 when we recognized stock based compensation expense under the intrinsic value recognition provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25). Beginning in May 2006, we have adopted the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (2006 Plan) which provides for a maximum term of seven years from the grant date for non statutory stock options and for incentive stock options (except that the maximum term is five years from the grant date for incentive stock options granted to a holder of more than 10% of the Companys stock). The 2006 Plan also provides for a defined option granting schedule for our outside directors. Details of the 2006 Plan are described in Note 6, Stockholders Equity, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K. Stock Repurchase Activities In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program. This program authorized repurchases of up to $250.0 million of our common stock. In the first quarter of 2006, we repurchased and retired 10,071,100 shares of common stock at an average price of $18.51 per share as part of our Common Stock Repurchase Program. No shares were repurchased after the three months ended March 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, a total of 12,939,700 common shares had been repurchased and retired since the inception of the program, equating to approximately $250.0 million at an average price of $19.32 per share. In July 2006, our Board authorized a new stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our Companys common stock. In February 2007, our Board approved an increase of $1.0 billion under this new share repurchase program. Coupled with the original $1.0 billion approved in July 2006, we are now authorized to repurchase up to $2.0 billion of our common stock. Purchases under this plan will be subject to a review of the circumstances in place at the time. Acquisitions under the share repurchase program will be made from time to time as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. The program may be discontinued at any time. Business Acquisitions We had no acquisitions in the year ended December 31, 2006. We completed a total of six acquisitions in the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. The main purposes of these acquisitions were to expand our product portfolio and customer base. The results of the following acquisitions have been included in our consolidated statements of operations beginning on their respective acquisition dates. The following is a summary of our acquisitions in 2004 and 2005: Funk Software, Inc. (Funk) acquired on December 1, 2005: Developed and sold products designed to protect the integrity of the network by verifying users and devices that meet an organizations security policies before granting network access. 37 Table of Contents Acorn Packet Solutions, Inc. (Acorn) acquired on October 20, 2005: Developed and sold products that enable migration from circuit based networks to more flexible and cost effective IP networks. Peribit Networks, Inc. (Peribit) acquired on July 1, 2005: Developed and sold products that enhance wide area network (WAN) optimization and application delivery. Redline Networks, Inc. (Redline) acquired on May 2, 2005: Developed and sold application front end platforms for enterprise data centers and public web sites. Kagoor Networks, Inc. (Kagoor) acquired on May 1, 2005: Developed and sold session border control products to enhance voice over Internet Protocol networking for communication carriers. NetScreen Technologies, Inc. (NetScreen) acquired on April 16, 2004: Developed and sold a broad array of integrated network security solutions for enterprises, service providers, and government entities. Acquisition Related Liabilities In connection with our acquisitions, we recorded liabilities associated with severance, future lease, and other obligations. The initial liabilities were recorded as part of the acquisitions and did not impact the consolidated statements of operations. The following is a summary of these liabilities: In 2005, we recorded liabilities of $4.5 million for the five acquisitions of that year, primarily related to future lease, severance, and other contractual obligations. As of December 31, 2006, there was $1.2 million remaining to be paid, primarily related to future leases that extend through 2009 and other contractual obligations. At the time of the NetScreen acquisition in 2004, we accrued $21.3 million primarily related to professional services, severance and facility charges. As of December 31, 2006, there was approximately $1.6 million remaining to be paid, primarily for facility leases that extend through 2008. At the time of the acquisition of Unisphere Networks, Inc. (Unisphere) in 2002, we accrued $14.8 million primarily related to professional services, severance and facility charges. As of December 31, 2006, there was approximately $0.8 million remaining to be paid, primarily for facility leases that extend through March 2011. Restructuring and Other Related Charges Restructuring Reserves We initiated restructuring plans to eliminate certain duplicative activities, focus on strategic product and customer bases, reduce cost structure and better align product and operating expenses with existing general economic conditions. The following is a summary of our restructuring plans charged to operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations: In 2006, we implemented a restructuring plan which provided for a reduction of 33 employees within the Infrastructure segment during the second and third quarters of 2006. Total accrual of $2.1 million, consisting primarily of severance and purchase commitment charges, was recognized as restructuring charges in operating expense and cost of product revenues in 2006. As of December 31, 2006, we had related restructuring reserves of $0.1 million recorded in short term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. In 2004, we implemented a restructuring plan at the time of the acquisition of NetScreen. We initially recorded a charge of approximately $0.4 million primarily related to workforce reduction costs, which has been completely paid as of December 31, 2006. In 2003, we implemented a restructuring plan, under which we announced that we would no longer develop our G series CMTS products and recorded a charge that was comprised of workforce reduction costs, non inventory asset impairment, costs associated with vacating facilities and terminating contracts and other related costs. We initially recorded a charge of approximately $14.0 million that was comprised of workforce reduction costs, non inventory asset impairment, vacating facilities costs, the costs associated with termination of contracts and other related costs. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $1.0 million remained unpaid primarily for a facility lease that extends through July 2008. 38 Table of Contents In 2002, we implemented a restructuring plan at the time of the Unisphere acquisition. We initially recorded a charge of $14.9 million, of which approximately $0.5 million remained unpaid as of December 31, 2006, primarily for facility leases that extend through April 2009. We adjusted our restructuring reserves primarily due to changes in lease and sublease assumptions as our needs changed as a result of our recent acquisitions and as the real estate markets changed. See Note 5 in Item 8 for a complete description of all restructuring charges and the amounts remained to be paid. Tax Repatriation We repatriated $225.0 million under the American Jobs Creation Act (Jobs Act) in 2005. We recorded a net tax benefit in 2005 of $19.7 million related to this repatriation dividend. The net tax benefit consists of a federal and state tax provision, net of federal benefit, of $9.7 million, offset by a tax benefit of $29.4 million related to an adjustment of deferred tax liabilities on un repatriated earnings. Nature of Expenses We have an extensive distribution channel in place that we use to target new customers and increase sales. We have made substantial investments in our distribution channel during 2006, 2005 and 2004. Most of our manufacturing, repair and supply chain operations are outsourced to independent contract manufacturers; accordingly, most of our cost of revenues consists of payments to our independent contract manufacturers for the standard product costs. The independent contract manufacturers produce our products using design specifications, quality assurance programs and standards that we establish. Controls around manufacturing, engineering and documentation are conducted at our facilities in Sunnyvale, California and Westford, Massachusetts. Our independent contract manufacturers have facilities primarily in Canada, China, Malaysia, and the United States. We generally do not own the components and title to products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon shipment. The contract manufacturers procure components based on our build forecasts and if actual component usage is lower than our forecasts, we may be, and have been in the past, liable for carrying or obsolete material charges. Employee related costs have historically been the primary driver of our operating expenses and we expect this trend to continue. Employee related costs include items such as wages, commissions, bonuses, vacation, benefits and travel. We added over 688 employees in 2006 primarily in engineering and customer service functions as a result of increased investment in customer service operations to support investment in the enterprise market. In 2005, we added 420 employees across all functions primarily as a result of acquisitions. We had 4,833, 4,145 and 2,948 employees as of December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Facility and information technology departmental costs are allocated to other departments based on headcount. These departmental costs have increased each of the last two years due to increases in headcount and facility leases resulting from acquisitions and additional infrastructure systems to support our growth. We expect to further invest in our internal information technology infrastructure in 2007. Research and development expenses include: The costs of developing our products from components to prototypes to finished products, Outside services for such services as certifications of new products, and expenditures associated with equipment used for testing. Several components of our research and development effort require significant expenditures, such as the development of new components and the purchase of prototype equipment, the timing of which can cause quarterly variability in our expenses. We expense our research and development costs as they are incurred. We plan to increase our investment in research and development during 2007 compared to 2006 to further advance our competitive advantage. 39 Table of Contents Sales and marketing expenses include costs for promoting our products and services, demonstration equipment and advertisements. These costs vary quarter to quarter depending on revenues, product launches and marketing initiatives. We plan to continue our investment in sales and marketing activities in both direct and channel sales. We will expand into new markets, particularly emerging markets, and continue to expand both our service provider and enterprise focus. We will also further develop our distribution channel in 2007 in an effort to expand and grow our presence in new markets, serving both private and public networks with a full portfolio of networking products. General and administrative expenses include professional fees, bad debt provisions and other corporate expenses. Professional fees include legal, audit, tax, accounting and certain corporate strategic services. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period. We regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from managements estimates. To the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future results of operations will be affected. We believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition. Our products are integrated with software that is essential to the functionality of our equipment. Additionally, we provide unspecified upgrades and enhancements related to our integrated software through our maintenance contracts for most of its products. Accordingly, we accounts for revenue in accordance with Statement of Position No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, and all related interpretations. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery or performance has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Evidence of an arrangement generally consists of customer purchase orders and, in certain instances, sales contracts or agreements. Shipping terms and related documents, or written evidence of customer acceptance, when applicable, are used to verify delivery or performance. We assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and the customers payment history to us. For arrangements with multiple elements, we allocate revenue to each element using the residual method based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered items. Vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately We then recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with our policies for product and service revenue recognition. Our ability to recognize revenue in the future may be affected if actual selling prices are significantly less than fair value. In addition, our ability to recognize revenue in the future could be impacted by conditions imposed by our customers. For sales to direct end users and value added resellers, we recognize product revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss, which is generally upon shipment. For our end users and value added resellers, there are no significant obligations for future performance such as rights of return or pricing credits. A portion of our sales are made through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits and or rights of return. We recognize product revenue on sales made through these distributors upon sell through as reported to us by the distributors. We recognize service revenue as the services are completed or ratably over the period of the obligation. We record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments, such as rebates and price protection, in the same period that the related revenue is recorded. The amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns and price protection credits, specific criteria included in rebate agreements, and other factors known at the time. Additional reductions to revenue would result if actual product returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of any of our customers was to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of its ability to make payments, additional allowances could be required. 40 Table of Contents Contract Manufacturer Liabilities. We outsource most of our manufacturing, repair and supply chain management operations to our independent contract manufacturers and a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of payments to them. Our independent contract manufacturers procure components and manufacture our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts are based on our estimates of future demand for our products, which are in turn based on historical trends and an analysis from our sales and marketing organizations, adjusted for overall market conditions. We establish reserves for carrying charges and obsolete material charges for excess components purchased based on historical trends. If the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecasted, which may be caused by factors outside of our control, we have contractual liabilities and exposures with the independent contract manufacturers, such as carrying costs and obsolete material exposures, which would have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability. Warranty Reserve. We generally offer a one year warranty on all of our hardware products and a 90 day warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the products. We establish reserves for estimated product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized. Although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, use of materials and technical labor costs and associated overhead incurred in correcting any product failure. Should actual product failure rates, use of materials or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, additional warranty reserves could be required, which could reduce gross margins. Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets. Goodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. The amounts and useful lives assigned to other intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization, and the amount assigned to in process research and development is expensed immediately. The value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, could be impacted by future adverse changes such as: (i) future declines in our operating results, (ii) a decline in the valuation of technology company stocks, including the valuation of our common stock, (iii) significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or the networking industry or (iv) failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results. We evaluate these assets on an annual basis as of November 1 or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. In the process of our annual impairment review, we use the market approach as well as the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method to determine the fair value of our intangible assets. Significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation. The estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business. It is possible, however, that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect. If our actual results, or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses, are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets, we could incur additional impairment charges. Stock Based Compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. Under the provisions of SFAS 123R, stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the awards fair value as calculated by the Black Scholes Merton (BSM) option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period. The BSM model requires various highly subjective assumptions including volatility, forfeiture rates, and expected option life. If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly, stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. In conjunction with the adoption of SFAS 123R, we also adopted the single approach method for valuing our stock based awards as well as the straight line method for amortizing the related stock based compensation expense. In connection with our restatement of the consolidated financial statements, we have applied judgment in choosing whether to revise measurement dates and if revised which measurement date to select for prior option grants. Information regarding the restatement, including ranges of possible additional stock based compensation expense if other measurement dates had been selected for certain grants, is set forth above under Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements and in Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K. Income Taxes. Estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences and carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income based on the realization criteria set forth under SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe to be more likely than not realizable. We believe it is more likely than not that forecasted income together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event 41 Table of Contents that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Similarly, if we subsequently realize deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation allowance would be reversed, resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings or a decrease in goodwill in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities may result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimate of tax liabilities is less than the amount ultimately assessed, a further charge to expense would result. Litigation and Settlement Costs. From time to time, we are involved in disputes, litigation and other legal actions. We are aggressively defending our current litigation matters; however, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and we cannot assure you that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation and or substantial settlement charges. In addition, the resolution of any future intellectual property litigation may require us to make royalty payments, which could adversely impact gross margins in future periods. If any of those events were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We record a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the range of loss can be reasonably estimated. However, the actual liability in any such litigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to record additional expenses. Loss Contingencies. We are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required. Results of Operations The following table illustrates certain statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of net revenues: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 As Restated (1) As Restated (1) Net revenues 100 % 100 % 100 % Cost of revenues 33 % 32 % 31 % Gross margin 67 % 68 % 69 % Operating expenses: Research and development 21 % 17 % 20 % Sales and marketing 24 % 21 % 25 % General and administrative 4 % 4 % 4 % Amortization of purchased intangible assets 4 % 4 % 4 % In process research and development 1 % 2 % Impairment of goodwill and intangibles 56 % Other charges, net 2 % Total operating expenses 111 % 47 % 55 % (Loss) income from operations (44 %) 21 % 14 % (1) See Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The increases in revenues, cost of expenses, and operating expenses in 2006 compared to 2005 were attributable to continued growth primarily driven by increased sales resulting from the consolidation in the large service providers market and increased success in the enterprise market in key areas like the U.S. Federal Government. In particular, we experienced sales growth in the emerging markets in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Asia, as well as significant growth in our sales to the top 10 world wide service 42 Table of Contents providers. Our service revenue grew substantially as a result of an increased equipment base, increased attach rates (the rate that purchases of equipment are accompanied by purchases of related services) on new sales and new professional services. The cost of revenues and operating expenses increases were directly attributable to the revenue growth and investments in research and development efforts. In addition, we recognized impairment and other charges in 2006. Net Revenues The following table shows total net product and service revenues and net product and service revenues as a percentage of total net revenues (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Net product revenues $ 1,893.3 82 % $ 1,771.0 86 % $ 1,162.9 87 % Net service revenues 410.3 18 % 293.0 14 % 173.1 13 % Total net revenues $ 2,303.6 100 % $ 2,064.0 100 % $ 1,336.0 100 % Our total net revenues increased $239.6 million, or 12%, to $2,303.6 million in 2006. Our total net revenues increased by $728.0 million, or 54%, to $2,064.0 million in 2005. Net Product Revenues The $122.3 million, or 7%, increase in our product net revenue from 2005 to 2006 was the result of increased activity in both service provider and enterprise markets. In particular we had success in selling our products to customers who are adopting next generation networks (NGN) IP networks, which are designed to reduce total operating costs and to be able to offer multiple services over a single network. In addition we had a number of new product releases during 2006 and expanded into new emerging markets. During 2006 and 2005, we recognized $4.2 million and $32.7 million, respectively, of product net revenue from shipments made to end users and value added resellers that were deferred at the end of the prior year. Infrastructure products accounted for $1,413.4 million or 75% of our total net product revenues during 2006 and $1,371.6 million or 77% of our total net product revenues during 2005. Infrastructure product net revenue grew by $41.8 million or 3% from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to continued success from a very significant year of growth in 2005, which strengthened our position as a supplier to the largest service providers in the world, particularly in the United States and in EMEA. This success was partially offset by a pause in the build out of NGNs and associated purchase decisions, particularly in Japan, as major carriers prepare for the next stage of bandwidth and services expansion, and a large product revenue deferral for products shipped to Verizon that is expected to be recognized in 2007. Infrastructure product net revenue increased 40.6% from 2004 to 2005, primarily due to the increase in revenues from service providers and enterprises as a result of significant success selling into the broadband and core networks for the service providers across the world and the recognition in the market place of Juniper Networks world class service provider solutions. SLT products accounted for $479.9 million or 25% of our total product revenue in 2006 and $399.4 million or 23% of total net product revenues during 2005. SLT product net revenue increased $80.5 million or 20% from 2005 to 2006 due to a growing demand and brand recognition for our Security products from large enterprises and the U.S. Federal Government. In addition, the new products announced in 2006 and those added to our portfolio through the various acquisitions in 2005 contributed to this increase. In addition, we experienced good success in selling SLT products to service providers for both their own IT infrastructure and resale. Our SLT product revenue increase in 2005 was primarily driven by the increased demands in security products by the enterprise market. Additionally, the acquisitions completed in 2005 enabled us to cross sell infrastructure, security, and application acceleration products to existing customer bases. An analysis of the change in revenue by Infrastructure and SLT segments, and the change in units, can be found below in the section titled Segment Information. 43 Table of Contents Net Service Revenues Net service revenues increased $117.3 million or 40% from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to an increase in the customer installed base that we are servicing, as well as increased attach rates on new product sales, improved enterprise service infrastructure allowing more rapid implementation of services and the addition of new professional service offerings. Professional service revenue also increased, to a lesser extent, in 2006 compared to 2005 due primarily to maintenance related on site engineering services as well as additional consulting projects in 2006. Net service revenues increased $119.9 million or 69% from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to the growth in support services and, to a lesser degree, the growth in professional services. A majority of our service revenue is earned from customers who purchase our products and enter into service contracts that are typically for one year renewable periods. The increases in support service revenue were primarily due to the additional technical support service contract initiations associated with higher product sales, which have resulted in increased renewal and a larger installed base of equipment being serviced. These contracts are typically for services such as 24 hour customer support, non specified updates and hardware repairs. We recognize revenue from service contracts as the services are completed or ratably over the period of the obligation. In addition to support services and professional services, we also provide educational services. Total Net Revenues The following table shows net revenue by geographic region (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Americas: United States $ 953.0 41 % $ 879.0 43 % $ 561.5 42 % Other 78.4 4 % 53.9 2 % 47.6 4 % Total Americas 1,031.4 45 % 932.9 45 % 609.1 46 % Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) 812.7 35 % 610.1 30 % 380.5 28 % Asia Pacific: Japan 159.3 7 % 204.8 10 % 155.7 12 % Other 300.2 13 % 316.2 15 % 190.7 14 % Total Asia Pacific 459.5 20 % 521.0 25 % 346.4 26 % Total $ 2,303.6 100 % $ 2,064.0 100 % $ 1,336.0 100 % We continue to experience varying distribution of revenue among our three geographic theaters, and we expect this trend to continue. Net revenue in the United States increased by $74.0 million in 2006 from 2005 due to continued success both with enterprise customers such as the U.S. Federal Government, as well as with major service providers in the United States. The increase was also due in part to sales to major internet content providers and the cable providers. This success was partially offset by a significant product revenue deferral for product shipped to Verizon. Net revenue in the United States as a percentage of total net revenue decreased by two percentage points in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of the strong growth in EMEA. Total 2006 revenue recorded by the Americas region grew by $98.5 million from its 2005 level and remained at 45% of worldwide revenue, as compared to 2005, due to significant success with the main service providers in Canada and various South American countries including Brazil and Argentina. Revenue in the EMEA region grew by $202.6 million or five percentage points in 2006 due to significant success with NGN deployments across the region, in particular Sweden, the Netherlands, France, and Germany, as well as sales growth in emerging regions including Russia, Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Revenue from the Asia Pacific region declined $61.5 million or 12% primarily due to the impact of certain NGN project decision delays in Japan driving revenue down year over year, partially offset by increased demands in China. Net revenue in the United States as a percentage of total net revenue increased from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to the growth driven by increased demand within the service provider and enterprise markets. Net revenue in EMEA as a percentage of total net revenue increased in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to strength across the region, including Germany and the United Kingdom. Net revenue in other Asia Pacific countries as a percentage of total net revenue remained fairly consistent with prior years. Siemens accounted for greater than 10% of our net product and service revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, 2004. We expect that our largest customers, as well as key strategic partners, will continue to account for a substantial portion of our 44 Table of Contents net revenue in 2007 and for the foreseeable future particularly due to the consolidation that continues to impact both our customers and partners. Cost of Revenues The following table shows cost of product and service revenues and the related gross margin (GM) percentages (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2006 GM% 2005 GM% 2004 GM% As Restated (1) As Restated (1) Cost of product revenues $ 555.1 71% $ 506.3 71% $ 318.8 73% Cost of service revenues 199.2 51% 147.2 50% 96.3 44% Total cost of revenues $ 754.3 67% $ 653.5 68% $ 415.1 69% (1) See Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Cost of Product Revenues Cost of product revenues increased $48.8 million or 10% in 2006 as compared to 2005. The increase was primarily attributable to increased product revenue in both the enterprise and service provider markets. Net product gross margin of 71% for 2006 fell by less than one percentage point compared to that in 2005 despite increased competitive pressure due to the impact of the mix of products; the mix of territories and reduced manufacturing costs. We expect to see increasing price competition and downward pressure on our product gross margins in the future. The increase in stock compensation expense in cost of product revenue from 2005 to 2006 of $0.9 million was primarily due to the impact of adopting SFAS 123R in 2006. The two percentage point decrease in product gross margins from 2004 to 2005 was primarily due to increasing competition as certain of our products have become more mature in their product cycles. As we expanded our market share and entered more markets since 2004, we experienced increasing price competition. Nevertheless, higher product revenue volume contributed to the increased gross margin by $420.6 million, or 50%, in 2005 when compared to 2004. Cost of Service Revenues Cost of service revenues increased $52.0 million in 2006 as compared to that in 2005. The increase was a direct result of a larger installed base of products covered by service contracts. However, our service gross margin increased one percentage point from 2005 to 2006 as a result of improved efficiencies and economies of scale, which result in a better leveraged service organization. Total employee salary and related expenses as a percentage of service revenue were: 20% for 2006, 20% for 2005 and 26% for 2004; however, in absolute dollars, employee salary and related expenses increased $22.3 million from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to an investment in new customer service personnel, particularly to support our enterprise customers. Stock compensation expense in cost of service revenue also increased by $4.1 million from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to the impact of adopting SFAS 123R in 2006. In addition to personnel expenses, outside services costs increased $7.1 million from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to contracting for engineers to provide professional services revenue, particularly for the Middle East and other emerging markets. Spares and shipping expenses increased $7.3 million and $5.6 million, respectively, from 2005 to 2006 due to a significant investment in spares around the world to support the increase in customer contracts, particularly in the enterprise market. Finally, the costs associated with facilities, depreciation and other expenses increased $4.9 million in cost of service revenue from 2005 to 2006 due to increases in revenue and investment in infrastructure to support the growing business. Service gross margins increased six percentage points from 2004 to 2005 and, increase was primarily attributable to a larger revenue increase when compared to the increase in cost of headcount, outside services, and spares purchases, all of which were needed to support the growing installed base. Total employee related expenses as a percentage of service revenue for 2005 decreased to 20% compared to 26% in 2004. Nevertheless, in absolute dollars, total service related costs increased $50.9 million from 2004 to 2005: employee related expenses increased $20.2 million, and outside service expenses increased by $17.5 million as a result of increased headcount during 2005. In addition, expense associated with spares increased by $7.1 million. 45 Table of Contents Research and Development, Sales and Marketing and General and Administrative Expenses The following table shows research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses amounts and as a percentage of total net revenues (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 As Restated (1) As Restated (1) Research and development $ 480.2 21 % $ 357.3 17 % $ 264.4 20 % Sales and marketing 558.0 24 % 441.6 21 % 324.3 24 % General and administrative 97.1 4 % 75.0 4 % 55.5 4 % (1) See Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses increased $122.9 million, or four percentage points of net revenue, in 2006 over 2005 as a result of our focus on the development of a broader portfolio of networking products. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases in personnel related expenses of $61.7 million, depreciation of $12.4 million, facility related expenses of $10.5 million, engineering and testing expenses of $8.3 million, outside service expenses of $3.5 million and equipment related expenses of $2.1 million. The increases in personnel related expenses in 2006 were primarily due to additional hires in the engineering organization across the Infrastructure and SLT segments. Headcount increased 19% from 1,736 individuals to 2,070 individuals during 2006. The headcount increase was attributable to product innovation efforts in areas including routers security and integration in order to capture potential future NGN infrastructure growth and other opportunities in the enterprise and the service provider markets. To a lesser extent, the increases in personnel expenses were attributable to merit based salary increases beginning in April 2006. Facility, engineering and testing expense increased in 2006 to support our product innovation efforts. Outside service expenses increased in 2006 primarily due to additional consulting projects on developing future product roadmaps. The increase in stock compensation expense in research and development expenses from 2005 to 2006 of $24.0 million was primarily due to the impact of adopting SFAS 123R in 2006. We continue to invest in both stand alone as well as integrated products in order to satisfy our customer needs. Our investment and expansion on our global research and development efforts were primarily in China and India. Research and development expenses increased $92.9 million in 2005 compared to 2004, but decreased by 3% of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases in personnel related expenses of $66.4 million, facility related expenses of $14.1 million, engineering and testing expenses of $12.6 million, equipment related expenses of $8.5 million, and depreciation of $5.1 million. The increases in personnel related expenses in 2005 were primarily due to additional hires in the engineering organization, including those from the five acquisitions. The increase was partially offset by the decrease in research and development related stock compensation expense of $14.3 million compared to 2004 as a result of forfeitures of unvested options in 2005 and additional compensation expense recorded as a result of our restatement discussed in Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we invested and expanded on our global research and development efforts, specifically in China and India. Sales and Marketing Expenses Sales and marketing expenses increased $116.4 million in 2006 compared to 2005 and increased as a percent of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases in personnel related expenses of $58.9 million, increases in facility related expense of $12.0 million, increases in travel expenses of $10.3 million, increases in marketing related activities of $6.6 million, and increases in equipment related expenses of $2.6 million. Personnel related expenses increased in 2006 primarily due to additional hires to support the expansion of our distribution channels and customer base, as well as to support the larger portfolio of products. In particular, we expanded our enterprise sales force, and targeted key growth areas such as China, Middle East and India. We added 171 individuals to our sales and marketing function during 2006. Travel expense increased in 2006 due primarily to increased headcount and more activity in emerging markets. Marketing related activities increased primarily as a result of specific activities designed to expand and improve our brand recognition, support of our distribution channels, introduction of new products, targeted solution value propositions and increase awareness of our existing products to a broader range of customers. Equipment related expenses increased in 2006 due to the introduction of new products. The increase in stock compensation expense in sales and marketing from 2005 to 2006 of $24.5 million was primarily due to the impact of adopting SFAS 123R in 2006. Sales and marketing expenses increased $117.3 million in 2005 compared to 2004 but decreased as a percent of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases in personnel related expenses of $97.3 million, increases in marketing 46 Table of Contents related activities of $10.9 million, and increases in equipment related expenses of $2.6 million. Personnel related expenses increased in 2005 primarily due to additional hires, including acquisitions, to support the expansion of our distribution channels and customer base, as well as to support the larger portfolio of products. Marketing related activities increased primarily as a result of specific activities designed to expand and improve our distribution channels, introduction of new products, and increase awareness of our existing products to a broader range of customers. Stock based compensation pertaining to sales and marketing functions was $6.8 million and $22.0 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased $22.1 million in 2006 compared to 2005 and remained at 4% of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was driven by increases in personnel related expenses of $5.6 million and other related expense. General and administrative world wide headcount increased 11%, or by 24 individuals, during 2006, to support the overall growth in the business. The net change in bad debt expense reversal increased $2.3 million due primarily to the bad debt expense reversal in 2005. Facility and IT related expense increased $1.2 million as a result of our personnel growth and development of our systems infrastructure. The increase of general and administrative related stock compensation expense from 2005 to 2006 of $11.8 million was primarily due to the impact of adopting SFAS 123R in 2006. General and administrative expenses increased $19.5 million in 2005 compared to 2004 and remained at 4% of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was driven by increases in personnel related expenses of $10.6 million and a $10.0 million patent related expense. The $10.0 million patent expense pertained to an agreement we entered into with a third party to avoid future disputes. Stock based compensation pertaining to general and administrative function was $1.2 million and $2.2 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Other Operating Expenses The following table shows other operating expenses (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Amortization of purchased intangible assets $ 91.8 $ 85.2 $ 56.8 Impairment of goodwill and intangibles 1,283.4 5.9 In process research and development 11.0 27.5 Other charges, net: Restructuring and acquisition related charges, net 5.9 (6.5 ) (5.1 ) Integration costs 5.1 Stock option investigation costs 20.5 Tax related charges 10.1 Total other charges, net $ 36.5 $ (6.5 ) $ Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets Amortization of purchased intangible assets increased $6.6 million in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of recognizing a full year of amortization associated with the five acquisitions completed in 2005. The amortization of purchased intangible assets increased $28.4 million in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to the additional intangible assets from the five acquisitions completed in 2005. See Note 3 in Item 8 for more information on our purchased intangible assets. Impairment of Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets Impairment charges increased by $1,283.4 million in 2006 as a result of the impairment of both goodwill and purchased intangible assets during 2006. Due primarily to the decline in the Companys market capitalization that occurred over a period of approximately six months prior to the impairment review and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in the forecasted future cash flows used in the income approach, we evaluated the carrying value of our goodwill and reduced the goodwill within the SLT segment by $1,280.0 million. In addition, we recorded a $3.4 million impairment expense pertaining to a write down of intangible assets as a result of a decrease in forecasted revenue for the SBC stand alone products during the second quarter of 2006. In 2005, we wrote down $5.9 million of purchased intangible assets acquired from Kagoor. 47 Table of Contents In Process Research and Development No charges related to in process research and development were incurred in 2006. In 2005, a total of $11.0 million was charged to IPRD expense in connection with three of our five acquisitions during the year. Of the total Funk purchase price, $5.3 million was allocated to in process research and development (IPRD). Of the total Peribit purchase price, $3.8 million was allocated to IPRD. Of the total Kagoor purchase price, $1.9 million was allocated to IPRD. None of the Acorn or Redline purchase prices were allocated to IPRD. In 2004, $27.5 million was allocated to IPRD from the NetScreen acquisition and was expensed during the year. Projects that qualify as IPRD represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and which have no alternative future use. Technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to a beta phase working prototype in which there is no remaining risk relating to the development. At the time of acquisition, Funk, Peribit, Kagoor, and NetScreen had multiple IPRD efforts under way for certain current and future product lines. For Funk, these efforts included development of new versions for the Steel Belted Radius (SBR), SBR High Availability (HA), and Mobile IP Module (MIM) II products all related to the Radius product offering. IPRD as of the acquisition date also included development of new versions for Endpoint Assurance, Proxy (Remote Control), and Odyssey product families. At the time of the Funk acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts will be completed over the next four months at an estimated cost of approximately $0.9 million. For Peribit, these efforts included the development of next versions of software for the Sequence Reducer (SR) family, Sequence Mirror (SM) family, the Central Management System (CMS) products, as well as a hardware program for both the SR and SM families. At the time of the Peribit acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over the next twelve months at an estimated cost of approximately $2.3 million. For Kagoor, these efforts included a variety of signaling protocols and next generation products and operating systems. At the time of the Kagoor acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over the next eight months at an estimated cost of approximately $0.8 million. For NetScreen, these efforts included integrating secure routers with embedded encryption chips, as well as other functions and features such as next generation Internet Protocol (IP), wireless and digital subscriber line connectivity and voice over IP capability. We utilized the discounted cash flow (DCF) method to value the IPRD, using rates ranging from 20% to 25%, depending on the estimated useful life of the technology. In applying the DCF method, the value of the acquired technology was estimated by discounting to present value the free cash flows expected to be generated by the products with which the technology is associated, over the remaining economic life of the technology. To distinguish between the cash flows attributable to the underlying technology and the cash flows attributable to other assets available for generating product revenues, adjustments were made to provide for a fair return to fixed assets, working capital, and other assets that provide value to the product lines. At the time of the NetScreen acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over the next eighteen months at an estimated cost of approximately $25.0 million. As of December 31, 2006, the estimated costs to complete the above research and development efforts were immaterial. Other Charges, Net Other charges are summarized as follows: Restructuring and Acquisition Related Reserves. We recorded net restructuring and acquisition related bonus expenses of $5.9 million in 2006, of which $5.6 million pertained to bonus accruals associated with the Funk and Acorn acquisitions and $0.3 million pertained to net restructuring related charges. During 2006, we accrued $0.7 million in restructuring charges due to the initiation of a restructuring plan which focused on some product development costs reductions and the discontinuation of our SBC product. The $6.5 million credit to restructuring and acquisition related expenses in 2005 primarily consisted of $6.9 million in adjustments related to our restructuring accrual when we re occupied a portion of the former NetScreen facility that was previously included in this acquisition related restructuring reserve, partially offset by a $0.3 million bonus and earn out accrual related to the Funk and Acorn acquisitions. In 2004, we also recorded net adjustments of $5.1 million to the previously established restructuring reserves primarily for changes in estimates related to changes in lease and sublease assumptions. 48 Table of Contents Integration Costs. We had no significant costs in either 2006 or 2005 related to the integration of acquired product lines or business units during those years. We recognized $5.1 million in integration costs for the NetScreen acquisition in 2004. Integration expenses are incremental costs directly related to the integration of the two companies. The integration expenses consisted principally of facility related expenses, workforce related expenses and professional fees. We estimate that the majority of the integration costs related to our 2005 and 2004 acquisitions have been incurred and that there will be an immaterial amount of additional integration costs for these acquisitions in the foreseeable future. Stock Option Investigation Costs. We recorded expenses of $20.5 million in 2006 relating to professional fees and other costs necessary to conduct our independent stock option investigation. Tax Related Charges. We recorded $10.1 million in operating expense during 2006 in relation to certain taxes associated with stock option grants to employees. Other Income and Expenses The following table shows other income and expenses (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Interest and other income $ 104.3 $ 59.1 $ 28.2 Interest and other expense (3.6 ) (3.9 ) (5.4 ) Write down of equity investments (0.4 ) (2.9 ) Loss on redemption of convertible subordinated notes (4.1 ) Gain on sale of equity or available for sale investments 1.7 Interest and other income increased $45.2 million from 2005 to 2006 and $30.9 million from 2004 to 2005 as a result of higher cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, and an increase in rates of return realized from our investments. Interest expense decreased $0.3 million from 2005 and 2006 primarily due to lower portfolio management fees. Interest and other expenses decreased $1.5 million from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to the retirement of our subordinated notes during 2004, resulting in savings of $2.5 million, which was partially offset by foreign exchange related losses from balance sheet revaluation and bank fees. We have certain minority equity investments in privately held companies that are carried at cost, adjusted for any impairment, as we do not have a controlling interest and do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over these companies. In 2006, there were no permanent changes in the market value of these holdings, and therefore we made no change to the valuation of these assets. During 2005 and 2004, we wrote down these investments by $0.4 million and $2.9 million respectively, for changes in market value that we believed were other than temporary. In 2005, we recorded a gain of $1.7 million in connection with a business combination transaction of a privately held company in our investment portfolio. Our cost basis of this equity investment was $1.0 million. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes decreased to $104.4 million in 2006 from $146.8 million in 2005. The 2006 effective rate was (11.6%) and differs from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the inability to benefit from a substantial portion of the goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2006. Provision for income taxes increased to $146.8 million in 2005 from $79.9 million in 2004. The 2005 effective rate was 29.5% and differs from the federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to the benefit of tax credits, income in foreign jurisdictions taxed at lower rates and a reduction in deferred tax liabilities related to the repatriation in 2005 of $225.0 million under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The provision for income taxes presented for 2005 and 2004 has been reduced by approximately $1.4 million and $3.4 million, respectively, due to the tax effect of the restatement for stock compensation charges. See Note 2 for additional details. 49 Table of Contents Segment Information A description of the products and services for each segment can be found in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We began to track financial information by our three operating segments during 2006 and 2005 as our management structure and responsibilities began to measure the business based on management operating income. We have included segment financial data for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006 for comparative purposes. Financial information for each operating segment used by management to make financial decisions and allocate resources is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 As Restated (1) As Restated (1) Net Revenues: Infrastructure $ 1,413.4 $ 1,371.6 $ 975.7 Service Layer Technologies 479.9 399.4 187.2 Service 410.3 293.0 173.1 Total net revenues 2,303.6 2,064.0 1,336.0 Operating Income: Management operating income: Infrastructure 420.0 487.4 304.4 Service Layer Technologies (12.8 ) 9.6 (5.5 ) Service 101.3 71.9 32.6 Total management operating income 508.5 568.9 331.5 Amortization of purchased intangible assets (2) (97.3 ) (85.2 ) (56.8 ) Stock based compensation expense (87.6 ) (22.3 ) (54.9 ) Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets (1,283.4 ) (5.9 ) In process research and development (11.0 ) (27.5 ) Other expense, net (3) (38.0 ) (3.5 ) Total operating (loss) income (997.8 ) 441.0 192.3 Interest and other income 104.3 59.1 28.2 Interest and other expense (3.6 ) (3.9 ) (5.4 ) Gain on (write down of) investment, net 1.3 (2.9 ) Loss on redemption of convertible subordinated notes (4.1 ) (Loss) income before income taxes $ (897.1 ) $ 497.5 $ 208.1 (1) Stock based compensation expense for the 2005 and 2004 periods has been restated as a result of the stock option investigation. In addition, prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect the reorganization of certain research and development activities and changes in allocation methodologies. (2) Amount includes amortization expense of purchased intangible assets in operating expenses and in costs of revenues. (3) Other expense for 2006 includes charges such as restructuring, acquisition related charges, stock option investigation costs and tax related charges, as well as certain restructuring costs that were included in cost of revenues. Other expense for 2005 includes charges such as restructuring, acquisition related charges and patent related charges. Infrastructure Operating Segment Infrastructure segment net revenues increased from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to increases in revenue from higher end infrastructure chassis products and increased penetration by our core and edge router portfolio as a result service providers acquiring products for their NGNs and multi play service offerings. In addition we believe there is increased demand for our products due to the adoption and expansion of IP networks as a result of peer to peer interaction, increased broadband usage, video, IPTV and an increasing reliance on the network as a mission critical business tool in the strategies of our IP customers, and of their enterprise customers. Infrastructure segment net revenues increased from 2004 to 2005 due to the adoption and expansion of IP networks by our customers in order to reduce total operating costs and to be able to offer multiple services over a single network. We track Infrastructure revenue units recognized and ports shipped to analyze customer trends and indicate areas of potential network growth. Our infrastructure product platforms are essentially modular, with the chassis serving as the base of the platform. Each chassis has a certain number of slots that are available to be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces. The modules are the components through which the router receives incoming packets of data from a variety of transmission media. The physical connection between a transmission medium and a module is referred to as a port. The number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the functionality and throughput offered by the module. Chassis revenue units represent the number of chassis on 50 Table of Contents which revenue was recognized during the period. The following table shows infrastructure revenue units recognized and ports shipped: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Infrastructure chassis revenue units 10,211 9,977 7,102 Infrastructure ports shipped 160,318 153,763 115,255 Chassis revenue units increased from 2005 to 2006 due primarily to the sales of higher end T series and M series products and the inclusion of the chassis units related to a 2005 acquisition, partially offset by decreases in sales of lower end E series and M series products. Sales of higher end chassis units increased as our customers continued to adopt and expand IP networks in order to reduce total operating costs and to be able to offer multiple services over a single network. Port shipment units increased from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to the increase in port demands driven by the larger expansion capacity in the higher end chassis revenue units shipped during 2006, partially offset by the lower port capacity in CTP series chassis revenue units. Chassis revenue units increased from 2004 to 2005 due primarily to investment in new broadband and other service provider networks during this time. Port shipment units increased from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to the growth in subscribers and services utilizing the networks. Infrastructure management operating income decreased from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to higher personnel related costs associated with our investments in product innovation for next generation core and edge infrastructure products as well as increased operating expenses associated with marketing related efforts and improvements to our internal infrastructure, partially offset by savings in sales expense during 2006 as we increasingly leveraged our existing distribution channel. Infrastructure management operating income increased from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to increases in revenue as evident by the increase in chassis revenue units and the productivity leverage such increase created. The increase was partially offset by higher personnel related costs primarily related to support product innovation and the expansion of our sales channels. SLT Operating Segment The SLT operating segment consists of security products and application acceleration products. The following table shows SLT revenue units recognized: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 SLT revenue units 183,575 170,181 81,015 SLT net revenue increased from 2005 to 2006 primarily attributable to sales increases across various SLT product families including firewalls/VPN, IDP, J series, DX, and SSL/VPN. The full year of inclusion of the DX and application acceleration products from the acquisitions completed in 2005 also contributed to the SLT revenue increases in 2006. Another part of the increase was driven by cross selling our SLT products into service providers for internal use and managed services; and a further part of the increase was due to successfully selling to much larger enterprise customers with increased footprint and complexity. SLT net revenues increased from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to the NetScreen acquisition in 2004, and to a lesser extent, the Funk, Peribit, Redline, and Kagoor acquisitions and increases in the sales of firewall/VPN products in 2005. SLT segment incurred a management operating loss in 2006, compared to the management operating income in 2005, due primarily to higher product and personnel related costs despite the higher SLT net revenues and gross margin. Increases in personnel related costs were primarily related to headcount growth in order to support product innovation, new products sales and a larger customer base. We have made a strategic decision to invest more into the enterprise and SLT markets to drive increased revenues and SLT productivity in the future. SLT Management operating income increased from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to increases in net revenue, partially offset by increased expenses primarily related to product innovation and the expansion of our sales channels. Additionally, the purchase accounting adjustments related to the NetScreen acquisition negatively impacted the revenue and management operating results in 2004. Service Operating Segment Net service revenues increased from 2005 to 2006 mainly due to the growth in support services, and to a lesser extent, the growth in professional services. The growth in the support services was largely due to increased technical support service contracts associated with higher product sales, which have resulted in our growing installed base of equipment being serviced. The growth in professional services was mainly due to resident engineering professional services and consulting projects in 2006. Service gross margin percentages as well as Service management operating income increased from 2005 to 2006 due primarily to improved economies of 51 Table of Contents scale achieved by faster revenue growth through the Infrastructure products and the SLT products relative to the increases in operating costs. In absolute dollars, employee related expenses increased in 2006 as a result of increased service related headcount from 476 to 611 individuals. Expenses associated with spare components also increased in 2006 to support increased demands driven by additional service contracts as a result of our growing installed base. Net service revenues increased in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to the growth in support services and, to a lesser degree, the growth in professional services. The growth in the support services was largely due to improved renewal rates and our growing installed base. Service management operating income increased as a result of the revenue growth experienced in the Infrastructure segment and the SLT segment, partially offset by increases in operating costs, primarily due to personnel related costs. In absolute dollars, employee related expenses increased as a result of increased headcount. Expenses associated with spares also increased as a result of revenue growth. Key Performance Measures In addition to the financial metrics included in the consolidated financial statements, we use the following key performance measure to assess operating results: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Days sales outstanding (DSO) (a) 38.5 42.5 39.6 (a) Days sales outstanding, or DSO, is calculated as the ratio of ending accounts receivable, net of allowances, divided by average daily net sales for the preceding 90 days. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview We have funded our business by issuing securities and through our operating activities. The following table shows our capital resources (in millions): As of December 31, 2006 2005 Working capital $ 1,759.2 $ 1,261.4 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,596.3 $ 918.4 Short term investments 443.9 510.4 Long term investments 574.1 618.3 Restricted cash 45.6 66.1 Working capital increased $497.8 million from 2005 to 2006 mainly due to cash provided by operating activities and investing activities, partially offset by cash used in financing activities. The significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, short term investments and accounts receivable, reduced by accounts payable, accrued liabilities and deferred revenue. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short term and long term investments, together with cash generated from operations and from the exercise of employee stock options and the purchase of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan, will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, commitments, repurchases of our common stock, and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations through at least the next 12 months. However, it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities beyond the next 12 months or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses, assets, products or technologies. We could raise such funds by selling equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors, or by borrowing money from financial institutions. In addition, even though we may not need additional funds, we may still elect to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons. There are no transactions, arrangements, and other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of our requirements for capital resources, except the $2.0 billion stock repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors as described below. If we were to purchase $2.0 billion of our common stock, we would significantly reduce our working capital and we may elect to obtain additional debt or credit facilities to fund the repurchases. Our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending on many factors, including: 52 Table of Contents the overall levels of sales of our products and gross profit margins; our business, product, capital expenditure and research and development plans; the market acceptance of our products; repurchase of our common stock; issuance and repayment of debt; litigation expenses, settlements and judgments; volume price discounts and customer rebates; the levels of accounts receivable that we maintain; acquisitions of other businesses, assets, products or technologies; changes in our compensation policies; capital improvements for new and existing facilities; technological advances; our competitors responses to our products; our relationships with suppliers and customers; expenses related to our future restructuring plans, if any; legal and professional service fees associated with our stock option investigation activities; tax expense associated with stock based awards; issuance of stock based awards and the related payment in cash for withholding taxes in the current year and possibly during future years; the level of exercises of stock options and stock purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan; and general economic conditions and specific conditions in our industry and markets, including the effects of recent international conflicts and related uncertainties. Cash Requirements In July 2006, our Board authorized a new stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our Companys common stock. In February 2007, our Board approved an increase of $1.0 billion under this new share repurchase program. Coupled with the original $1.0 billion approved in July 2006, we are now authorized to repurchase up to $2.0 billion of our common stock. Purchases under this plan will be subject to a review of the circumstances in place at the time. Acquisitions under the share repurchase program will be made from time to time as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. The program may be discontinued at any time. In May 2006, our audit committee commenced an independent review of our stock option practices and related accounting. The audit committee was assisted by independent legal counsel and accounting experts. We recognized $20.5 million of expense for legal and other professional services associated with this stock option review through December 31, 2006. In addition, we incurred tax related charges of $10.1 million in 2006. We expect to incur additional fees and other costs in 2007. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at December 31, 2006 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in millions): Less Than More than Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Operating leases, net of committed subleases (a) $ 182.2 $ 40.8 $ 60.9 $ 47.0 $ 33.5 Senior Notes (b) 399.9 399.9 Purchase commitments (c) 120.5 120.5 Other contractual obligations (d) 27.9 27.9 Total $ 730.5 $ 189.2 $ 460.8 $ 47.0 $ 33.5 (a) We occupy approximately 1.5 million square feet world wide under operating leases. The majority of our office space is in North America, including our corporate headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. Our longest lease expires in May 2016. (b) Our principal commitment as of December 31, 2006 was our outstanding Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2008 (Senior Notes). The Senior Notes were issued in June 2003 and are senior unsecured obligations, rank on parity in right of 53 Table of Contents payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured debt, and rank senior to all of our existing and future debt that expressly provides that it is subordinated to the notes. The Senior Notes bear no interest, but are convertible into shares of our common stock, subject to certain conditions, at any time prior to maturity or their prior repurchase by Juniper Networks. The conversion rate is 49.6512 shares per each $1,000 principal amount of convertible notes, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The carrying value of the Senior Notes as of December 31, 2006 was $399.9 million. (c) We do not have firm purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers. In order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply, the contract manufacturers place non cancelable, non returnable (NCNR) orders, which were valued at $120.5 million as of December 31, 2006, based on our build forecasts. We do not take ownership of the components and the NCNR orders do not represent firm purchase commitments pursuant to our agreements with the contract manufacturers. The components are used by the contract manufacturers to build products based on purchase orders we have received from our customers. We do not incur a liability for products built by the contract manufacturer until it fulfills our customers order and the order ships. However, if the components go unused, we may be assessed carrying charges or obsolete charges. As of December 31, 2006, we had accrued $22.4 million based on our estimate of such charges. (d) Other Contractual obligations consist of the following: Escrow amount of $12.8 million related to the Funk acquisition to secure certain indemnity obligations. One half of the escrow expired in January 2007 and the remaining one half will expire in June 2007. Also included is a contingent bonus payable, based on certain milestones, of $5.0 million, which was earned over a one year period ending in 2006. Escrow amount of $1.6 million related to the Acorn acquisition to secure certain indemnity obligations. The escrow period will expire in May 2007. Also included is a contingent earn out payable to former Acorn stockholders, based on certain milestones, of up to $2.2 million, and a contingent bonus payable to employees related to continued employment of up to $0.5 million. The earn out and bonus amounts will be paid, to the extent earned, in 2007 and 2008. Escrow amount related to the Redline and Kagoor acquisitions of $0.7 million and $5.1 million, respectively, to secure certain indemnity obligations. There was 0.8 million shares of the Companys common stock with a fair value of $17.6 million, established as of the acquisition date, were held in escrow to secure certain indemnity obligations for the Peribit acquisition. Almost all of the escrow shares were distributed in February 2007 at the then current market value of $19.15 per share, or an aggregate fair value of $14.1 million. Summary of Cash Flows Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $755.6 million, $642.9 million and $439.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The cash provided by operating activities for each period was due to our net income (loss) adjusted by: Non cash charges of $1,536.4 million, $307.4 million, and $254.0 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, primarily related to depreciation and amortization expenses, stock based compensation, tax benefit of employee stock option plans, in process research and development from acquisitions, debt issuance costs, loss on disposal of property and equipment, restructuring expense, and impairment charges. Non cash charges in 2006 included a $1,283.4 million impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. In 2005 and 2004, non cash charges included $128.1 million and $62.6 million of tax benefit from employee stock options while tax benefit from employee stock options which in accordance with SFAS 123R are no longer included in cash flows from operations beginning in 2006 but rather are included in financing activities. In 2006, tax benefits from tax deductions in excess of the stock based compensation expense recognized was presented as a financing activity in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of 2006. Non cash charges in 2005 also included a benefit from the reversal of NetScreens acquisition related liabilities and a loss due to the impairment of an equity investment, partially offset by gains associated with available for sale investments. In 2004, non cash charges also included a loss from the redemption of the 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes and a loss due to the write down of equity investments. Net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $220.6 million, $(15.1) million, and $57.2 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, were in the normal course of business. These changes are highlighted as follows: 54 Table of Contents Net cash increases in 2006 are primarily attributable to increases in deferred revenue of $132.8 million due to the growing installed base and customer payments in advance of product acceptance. The increase in operating cash flows was also due to the decreases in accounts receivable of $20.7 million and aggregate decreases in prepaid expenses, other current assets and other long term assets of $23.0 million. Accounts payable increased $13.6 million and accrued compensation increased $12.7 million primarily due to the costs of headcount increases and related employee bonuses. Changes in taxes payable and other accrued liabilities contributed $18.3 million to cash flows from operations in 2006. Net cash used during the year ended December 31, 2005 from changes in account balances was primarily attributable to increases in net accounts receivable of $68.1 million and decreases in other accrued liabilities of $100.7 million and accrued warranty of $3.7 million. Decreases in the prepaid expenses, other current assets and other long term assets accounts of $5.3 million, the increases in income taxes payable of $26.6 million, deferred revenue of $64.3 million, accounts payable of $50.3 million and accrued compensation of $10.9 million contributed positively to cash flows from operations. Net cash provided during the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily attributable to increases in deferred revenue of $93.6 million due to increases in the Companys installed base. Increases in accrued compensation of $40.3 million, accounts payable of $29.4 million, income taxes payable of $16.9 million, other accrued liabilities of $11.0 million and accrued warranty of $3.6 million contributed to operating cash flows. These amounts were partially offset by increases in net accounts receivable of $81.4 million and prepaid expenses, other current assets, and other long term assets of $56.3 million. Investing Activities Net cash provided in investing activities was $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Net cash used in investing activities was $583.7 million and $58.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Investing activities included capital expenditures and the purchases and sale or maturities of available for sale securities, the purchase and sale of equity investments, and the acquisitions of businesses. Capital expenditures increased $3.9 million to $102.1 million in 2006 and increased $35.0 million to $98.2 million in 2005 mainly due to new product developments and overseas expansions, and business acquisitions. Positive net cash flows of $115.9 million generated from the sales and purchases of available for sale securities in 2006 was primarily due to higher short term interest rates. Purchases and sales of available for sale securities used $131.0 million and $34.7 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Other investing activities include: $15.1 million of cash was used in the acquisitions during 2005, $20.5 million of cash was provided by the decrease of restricted cash, and $7.3 million of minority equity investment during 2006; $15.1 million of cash used in acquisition was due to the escrow payments related to the 2005 acquisitions. Restricted cash decreased by $20.5 million in 2006 primarily due to the $15.1 million escrow payments associated with the 2005 acquisitions. Another contributing factor to the decrease in restricted cash in 2006 was the reduction in deposit requirements of $5.9 million pertaining to letters of credit for facility leases; $309.9 million of cash used in the 2005 acquisitions, $34.8 million of restricted cash funded to escrow accounts in relation to the 2005 acquisitions, and $9.8 million of minority equity investment during 2005; and $40.9 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired in connection with the NetScreen acquisition during 2004. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $89.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Net cash provided in financing activities was $146.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Net cash used in financing activities was $33.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Cash was provided during all periods from the issuance of common stock related to employee option exercises and stock purchase plans. In 2006, we repurchased 10,071,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $18.51 per share, or a total of $186.4 million. Common stock issued in relation to employee stock option exercises and Employee Stock Purchase Plan generated total cash proceeds of $87.1 million during the 2006 period. Beginning in 2006, SFAS 123R requires excess tax benefits relating to exercises of employee options to be included in financing activities. In 2006, total tax benefits of $9.7 million from tax deductions in excess of the expense recognized for employee stock options was presented as financing cash flows due to the adoption of SFAS 123R beginning on January 1, 2006. Tax deductions in excess of the expense recognized for employee stock options were previously included in operating cash flows prior to 2006. In 2005, common stock issued in relation to employee option exercises and Employee Stock Purchase Plan generated total cash proceeds of $146.0 million. In 2004, common stock issued in 55 Table of Contents relation to employee option exercises and Employee Stock Purchase Plan generated total cash proceeds of $175.2 million. During 2004, we spent $145.0 million to retire our Subordinated Notes and $63.6 million to retire 2.9 million shares of our common stock. The repurchase of our common stock did not have a material impact on our liquidity. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, (FIN 48). FIN 48 applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to FASB Statement 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, including uncertain tax positions. Under FIN 48 a company will recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. FIN 48 clarifies how a company would measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized, provides guidance as to the timing of the de recognition of previously recognized tax benefits and describes the methods for classifying and disclosing the liabilities within the financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits. FIN 48 also addresses when a company should record interest and penalties related to tax positions and how the interest and penalties may be classified within the income statement and presented in the balance sheet. Differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to and after the adoption of FIN 48 would be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings. We are required to adopt FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007. Upon adoption, there is a possibility that the cumulative effect would result in an adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings. In addition, the application of FIN 48 may increase our future effective tax rates and its future intra period effective tax rate volatility. We are currently evaluating the effect of the adoption of FIN 48 on our consolidated financial statements and are not yet in a position to determine such effects. In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurement, (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. The guidance clarifies the principle for assessing fair value based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. In support of this principle, the guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data such as companies own data. Under this guidance, fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating SFAS 157 and expect to adopt this guidance beginning on January 1, 2008. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types and maturities. These securities are generally classified as available for sale and, consequently, are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings of our investment portfolio. We do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures. The following table presents hypothetical changes in fair value of the financial instruments held at December 31, 2006 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates (in millions): Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Rate Decrease of X Basis Points (BPS) Fair Value as of Rate Increase of X BPS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) December 31, 2006 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS Government treasury and agencies $ 297.5 $ 296.0 $ 294.5 $ 293.0 $ 291.6 $ 290.1 $ 288.6 Corporate bonds and notes 520.4 517.7 515.0 512.3 509.6 506.8 504.1 Asset backed securities and other 333.9 333.4 332.9 332.4 331.9 331.4 331.0 Total $ 1,151.8 $ 1,147.1 $ 1,142.4 $ 1,137.7 $ 1,133.1 $ 1,128.3 $ 1,123.7 56 Table of Contents The following table presents hypothetical changes in fair value of the financial instruments held at December 31, 2005 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates (in millions): Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Rate Decrease of X Basis Points (BPS) Fair Value as of Rate Increase of X BPS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) December 31, 2005 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS Government treasury and agencies $ 304.7 $ 302.9 $ 301.1 $ 299.3 $ 297.6 $ 295.8 $ 294.0 Corporate bonds and notes 646.4 643.2 640.2 637.1 633.9 630.8 627.7 Asset backed securities and other 372.8 372.2 371.5 370.9 370.2 369.6 368.9 Total $ 1,323.9 $ 1,318.3 $ 1,312.8 $ 1,307.3 $ 1,301.7 $ 1,296.2 $ 1,290.6 These instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading. The modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (BPS), 100 BPS and 150 BPS, which are representative of the historical movements in the Federal Funds Rate. Foreign Currency Risk and Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts It is our policy to use derivatives to partially offset our market exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate transaction gains and losses generated by certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. These derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other income (expense). Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are largely offset by re measurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. These foreign exchange contracts have maturities between one and two months. Periodically, we use foreign currency forward and or option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to operating expenses. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of less than one year. The effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, and upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction, is subsequently reclassified into the consolidated statements of operations line item to which the hedged transaction relates. We record any ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments, which was immaterial during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, in other income (expense) in our results of operations. 57 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This Annual Report on Form 10 K (Report), including the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward looking statements regarding future events and the future results of our Company that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the industry in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management. Words such as expects, anticipates, targets, goals, projects, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. These forward looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this Report under the section entitled Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I and elsewhere, and in other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), specifically the most recent reports on Form 10 Q. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason. The information below has been adjusted to reflect the restatement of our financial results which is more fully described in the Explanatory Note immediately preceding Part I, Item 1, and in Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K. The following discussion is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingencies. In the course of operating our business, we routinely make decisions as to the timing of the payment of invoices, the collection of receivables, the manufacturing and shipment of products, the fulfillment of orders, the purchase of supplies, and the building of inventory and spare parts, among other matters. Each of these decisions has some impact on the financial results for any given period. In making these decisions, we consider various factors including contractual obligations, customer satisfaction, competition, internal and external financial targets and expectations, and financial planning objectives. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to sales returns, pricing credits, warranty costs, allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long term assets, especially goodwill and intangible assets, contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges, assumptions used in the valuation of stock based compensation, and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Overview of the Results of Operations To aid in understanding our operating results for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, we believe an overview of the significant events that affected those periods and a discussion of the nature of our operating expenses is helpful. Significant Events Business and Market Environment The year of 2006 marked our 10th anniversary and a year of considerable progress which culminated with record revenue results for both the year and in the fourth quarter. In addition, Standard Poors (SP) has added the company to the SP 500 Index as of the close of trading on June 1, 2006. During 2006, there has been and continues to be consolidation in the telecommunications industry (for example, the acquisitions of ATT Inc., MCI, Inc. and BellSouth Corporation) and consolidation among the large vendors of telecommunications equipment and services, such as the combination of Alcatel S.A. and Lucent Technologies Inc. and the acquisition of Redback Networks, Inc. by Ericsson. We believe our innovation and market momentum have also allowed us to build partnerships with other market leaders, which we announced in 2006, including Avaya Inc., Microsoft Corporation, NEC and Symantec Corporation. Our total installed base of products has grown to approximately $8.6 billion across more than 100 countries worldwide. These numbers are the result of more than 400,000 units shipped to over 20,000 customers thanks to the help of more than 9,000 partners since our inception. 31 Table of Contents In 2006, we had major Next Generation Network (NGN) wins in the service provider marketplace, helping us to achieve an overall installed base of over 2,500 units of the T series in North America, EMEA and selected countries in Asia. We saw significant success in carriers selecting equipment for the core of their networks designed to provide multiple types of services, such as voice, data and video, so called multi play, a strategic focus for us and an important growth opportunity for the future. We have also seen an increased level of interest in our SLT portfolio and a growing number of service providers using our SLT products for both managed service offerings and outsourced solutions for their customers. In fact, the number of service providers buying our SLT products increased 50% from 2005 to 2006. We successfully delivered the products we planned to deliver in 2006 despite the risks associated with the long length of product development, testing and acceptance cycles involved with these products in these markets. We have made good progress in 2006 and we are building a product portfolio in a market with solid demand for IP infrastructure. Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements In this Form 10 K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006 (the 2006 Form 10 K), we are restating our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005 and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 as a result of an independent stock option investigation commenced by the Board of Directors and Audit Committee. This restatement is more fully described in Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements, to Consolidated Financial Statements and in Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. This 2006 Form 10 K will also reflect the restatement of Selected Consolidated Financial Data in Item 6 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002. In addition, we are restating our unaudited quarterly financial information and financial statements for interim periods of 2005, and unaudited condensed financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2006. Financial information included in the reports on Form 10 K, Form 10 Q and Form 8 K filed by us prior to August 10, 2006, and the related opinions of our independent registered public accounting firm, and all earnings press releases and similar communications issued by us, prior to August 10, 2006 should not be relied upon and are superseded in their entirety by this Report and other reports on Form 10 Q and Form 8 K filed by us with the SEC on or after August 10, 2006. Stock Option Investigation On May 22, 2006, we issued a press release and Form 8 K announcing that we had received a request for information relating to our stock option granting practices from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York. In the same press release and Form 8 K, we announced that our Board of Directors (the Board) had directed the Boards Audit Committee, comprised of outside directors, to conduct a review of our stock option granting practices. On May 24, 2006, we received a letter from the SEC indicating that the SEC was conducting an inquiry regarding Juniper Networks. The investigation was conducted with the assistance of independent counsel and forensic accountants (collectively the Investigative Team). The investigation focused on all stock option grants made to all employees, officers, directors and consultants during the period following our initial public offering (IPO) on June 24, 1999 to May 23, 2006 (the relevant period). In addition, the Audit Committee investigation involved testing and analyses of our hiring, termination, leave of absence, grant notification and exercise practices regarding stock options and certain issues regarding grants made before the IPO. The scope of the investigation did not include a review of options granted by companies acquired by us. All of the companies acquired by us, with one exception, were privately held companies. None of the acquisitions was accounted for as a pooling of interests. All of the acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method as provided by Statement of Financial Standards No. 141, Business Combinations and its predecessor Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16, Business Combinations. In connection with the investigation, more than 785,000 physical and electronic documents were reviewed and 35 current and former directors, officers, employees and agents were interviewed. On December 20, 2006, we announced key findings of the Audit Committee. Key findings of the Audit Committee are: There were numerous instances in which grant dates were chosen with the benefit of hindsight as to the price of our stock, so as to give favorable exercise prices. In this regard, the Audit Committee identified serious concerns regarding the actions of certain former management in connection with the stock option granting process Formal documentation of stock option grants often lagged the referenced grant date Grants were made by persons or committees who did not have the proper authority to make the grants in question Management failed to exercise sufficient responsibility for the stock option granting process 32 Table of Contents Our CEO, Scott Kriens, received two stock option awards whose measurement dates for financial accounting purposes differ from the recorded grant dates for such awards. However, both options were exchanged and cancelled unexercised in 2001 as part of a company wide option re pricing program. Mr. Kriens has not exercised any stock options since 1998, approximately nine months before our IPO There were substantial changes to our granting procedures after June 9, 2003 and again in 2005. No grants subsequent to 2004 required new measurement dates There was no improper conduct by our Compensation Committee or Board of Directors regarding the granting of stock options by those bodies Our Audit Committee expressed their continuing confidence in Scott Kriens and the current management of the Company Consistent with the accounting literature and recent guidance from the SEC, we have organized the grants during the relevant period into categories based on grant type and the process by which the grant was finalized. We analyzed the evidence from the Audit Committees investigation related to each category including, but not limited to, physical documents, electronic documents, underlying electronic data about documents, and witness interviews. Based on the relevant facts and circumstances, we applied the then appropriate accounting standards to determine, for every grant within each category, the proper measurement date. If the measurement date was not the originally assigned grant date, accounting adjustments were made as required, resulting in stock based compensation expense and related tax effects. Grants made by our Board of Directors or Compensation Committee to Officers or Directors We have concluded that the measurement dates of several grants to executive officers who were reporting persons as that term is defined under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (Officers) and members of the Board of Directors made between June 1999 and June 2003 were incorrect. In general, during the relevant period, the Board or the Compensation Committee of the Board made grants to Officers and directors. Grants were sometimes approved at meetings of these bodies or by action by unanimous written consent. There were several instances in which grants to Officers or directors were given grant dates (and corresponding exercise prices) prior to the date on which formal corporate action making the grant was taken. In general, this appears to have been done to make the grant date coincide with either a specific event, such as the appointment or re election of a director or with the purported date options were granted to non Officers. In these cases, we have determined that the correct measurement date is the date on which our Board or Compensation Committee took the action to approve the grant. We also identified instances in which grants to Officers were granted effective upon a future event, such as the commencement of employment or closing of an acquisition. In these cases, we have determined that the date of the future event is the correct measurement date for such grants. We also identified instances where grants to Officers were made by a body not authorized by our Board to make grants to Officers and were subsequently ratified by our Board. In those instances, we determined that the correct measurement date is the date on which such ratification occurred. In connection with the application of these measurement principles, and after accounting for forfeitures, we have adjusted the measurement of compensation cost for options covering 5.6 million shares of common stock resulting in an incremental stock based compensation expense of $80.3 million on a pre tax basis over the respective awards vesting terms. In addition, there was one other grant to an Officer where approval of such grant was not reflected in minutes of a meeting or an action by unanimous written consent of our Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee. For that grant, the measurement date was determined based on the terms of the Officers offer letter and the date his employment commenced. With respect to that grant, we have adjusted the measurement of compensation cost for options covering 1.5 million shares of common stock resulting in an incremental stock based compensation expense of $6.5 million on a pre tax basis over the awards vesting terms after accounting for forfeitures. Grants to Non Officers We have concluded that the measurement dates of a large number of grants to non Officers during the period between June 1999 and December 2004 were incorrect. Our practice has been to grant stock options, except where prohibited, to nearly all full time employees in connection with joining us. To facilitate the granting of options to our rapidly growing workforce, the Board of Directors established a Stock Option Committee to grant options to non Officer employees. Between June 1999 and June 2003, the dates for a large number of grants made by our Stock Option Committee were chosen with the benefit of hindsight as to the price of our stock, so as to give favorable exercise prices. Moreover, our Stock Option Committees process for finalizing and documenting these grants was often completed after the originally assigned grant date. Beginning with grants dated June 20, 2003, we implemented a number of new procedures and policies regarding the granting of options to non Officer employees. After that, we have concluded that the pattern of consciously looking back for the most favorable dates for the employees ceased. However, the documentation and written approvals of grant dates still generally trailed the recorded grant dates. Based on all available facts and circumstances, the originally recorded 33 Table of Contents measurement dates for the grants made by our Stock Option Committee during the period from July 1999 through December 2004 can not be relied upon in isolation as the correct measurement dates. In 2005, we made additional changes to our procedures. No grants in 2005 and 2006 required new measurement dates. APB 25 defines the measurement date for determining stock based compensation expense as the first date on which both (1) the number of shares that an individual employee is entitled to receive and (2) the option or purchase price, are known. Throughout the relevant period, the Companys stock administration department entered the option grant information for grants made by the Stock Option Committee into its Equity Edge stock administration system. This system was used to monitor and administer our stock option program. The data in Equity Edge were sent on a regular basis to designated brokers, allowing grantees to view their options information in their accounts via the Internet. For grants made by the Stock Option Committee between June 1999 and December 2004, where there is no other reliable objective evidence pointing to an earlier single specific date that the number of shares and the individuals entitled to receive them and the price had become final, we have determined the Equity Edge entry date to be the most reliable measurement date for calculating additional stock based compensation expense under APB 25. Using this measurement date, and after accounting for forfeitures, we have adjusted the measurement of compensation cost for options covering 74.2 million shares of common stock resulting in an incremental stock based compensation expense of $636.7 million on a pre tax basis over the respective awards vesting terms. In many of the cases where the Equity Edge entry date was used as the measurement date, the formal Stock Option Committee granting documentation (consisting of unanimous written consents or minutes and related lists of recipients, amounts and types of awards) was not created or completed until a later date. Because the awards listed in the formal granting documentation did not differ from the grants entered into Equity Edge, the notice of the awards was made available to employees prior to the creation or completion of the granting documents, and because the completion of the documentation was treated as perfunctory, we determined that the Equity Edge entry date was the proper measurement date under APB 25 rather than the date the Stock Option Committee granting documentation was completed. In a number of cases, there was reliable objective evidence pointing to a single specific date that the number of shares and the individuals entitled to receive them and the price had become final. Such evidence primarily consisted of electronic data indicating that the granting instrument and schedule were created prior to the Equity Edge entry date. We also relied on other evidence such as emails or written agreements to determine the date certain options became final. Such evidence was used to determine the measurement dates for options for which we have adjusted the measurement of compensation cost for options covering 27.9 million shares of common stock resulting in incremental stock based compensation expense of $141.2 million on a pre tax basis over the respective awards vesting terms. We also concluded that there were instances in which clerical errors or omissions regarding the persons to receive an award or the number of options to be granted were corrected after the date of award. In the case of most additions made to correct omissions and other corrections that were not reflected on the grant documentation at the time of the applicable grant date or in documentation existing at the time of grant, we have determined that a new measurement date should be established. We considered whether certain of such changes or additions should give rise to variable accounting treatment and concluded that such treatment was not appropriate because the grants represented independent decisions or events rather than a continuation or modification of the other grants. We believe that the correct measurement date for these grants is the date Stock Administration entered the correction or addition into Equity Edge, except where objective evidence identifies an earlier date on which the correction was approved. After accounting for forfeitures, we have adjusted the measurement of compensation cost for options covering 1.3 million shares of common stock resulting in incremental stock based compensation of $11.9 million on a pre tax basis over the respective awards vesting terms. Stock Option Grant Modifications Connected with Terminations or Leaves of Absences and Other Matters Compensation expense was also recognized as a result of modifications that were made to certain employee option grant awards in connection with certain employees terminations or leaves of absence. Typically such modifications related to extensions of the time employees could exercise options following their termination of employment or that enabled the employee to vest in additional shares in relation to a leave of absence. For example, in connection with reductions in work force in 2001 and 2002, we increased the period for affected employees to exercise their options from 30 days to 90 days. We have incremental stock based compensation expense associated with such terminations or leaves of absence of $20.0 million on a pre tax basis in the period of modification. Compensation expense of $0.2 million on a pre tax basis was also recognized as a result of non employee grants to consultants in exchange for services and other matters. 34 Table of Contents Judgment In light of the significant judgment used in establishing revised measurement dates, alternate approaches to those used by us could have resulted in different compensation expense charges than those recorded by us in the restatement. We considered various alternative approaches. For example, in those cases where the formal documentation of a grant was completed after the date the grant was entered in Equity Edge, an alternative measurement date to using the Equity Edge entry date could be the creation date of the documentation. Changing the measurement dates for grants made by our Stock Option Committee from the Equity Edge entry date to the later of the electronic data creation date of the unanimous written consent or the related schedule of grants would cause the pre tax compensation charges of $636.7 million discussed above to increase by approximately $10.6 million. Conversely, where we established a new measurement date prior to the Equity Edge entry date for grants made by our Stock Option Committee to non Officers based on other evidence, such as the electronic data indicating the initial creation date of the granting instrument and schedule, an alternative measurement date could be the Equity Edge entry date. Changing the measurement dates for these grants by the Stock Option Committee from a date prior to Equity Edge entry date to the Equity Edge entry would increase the $141.2 million of the pre tax compensation charges discussed above by approximately $37.7 million. We believe that the approaches we used were the most appropriate under the circumstances. Summary of Stock Based Compensation Adjustments We adjusted the measurement dates for options covering a total of 110.5 million, or 76%, of the 146.0 million shares of common stock covered by options granted during the relevant period. The impact from on the consolidated statement of operations from recognizing stock based compensation expense through December 31, 2006 resulting from the investigation is summarized as follows (in millions): Fiscal Year Pre Tax Expense After Tax Expense 1998 $ $ 1999 15.3 15.3 2000 283.3 201.6 2001 513.1 488.1 2002 48.0 48.0 2003 19.4 8.6 Subtotal 879.1 761.6 2004 10.9 7.5 2005 4.7 3.3 Total $ 894.7 $ 772.4 In addition to the $894.7 million recognized through fiscal 2005, $2.1 million of unamortized deferred compensation remained as of December 31, 2005, bringing the total incremental impact from the investigation to approximately $896.8 million. As required by SFAS 123R, which was adopted on January 1, 2006, the unamortized deferred compensation of $2.1 million has been reclassified to additional paid in capital, along with the unamortized deferred compensation for stock options assumed from past acquisitions, in our consolidated balance sheet. Beginning in 2006, the incremental amortization resulting from the investigation is included in stock based compensation expense under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R). The incremental stock based compensation expense from the restatement of employee stock options was $0.6 million, on a pre tax basis, for the year ended December 31, 2006. Other Matters After considering all available evidence, primarily the then current 2005 operating projections of future income, which remain appropriate, we have concluded that the previously recorded valuation allowance related to the tax benefit of stock options deductions should have been reversed in the fourth quarter of 2005. Accordingly, we decreased the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2005 by $158.0 million with a corresponding credit to additional paid in capital. The remaining valuation allowance balance of $40.6 million relates to capital losses which will carry forward to offset future capital gains. Additionally, we misclassified the tax benefit from deductions from stock options assumed in acquisitions. Accordingly, we have reduced additional paid in capital for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 by $6.0 million and $18.5 million, respectively, with a corresponding decrease to goodwill. The total reduction to both additional paid in capital and goodwill as of December 31, 2005 was $24.5 million. 35 Table of Contents Because virtually all holders of options issued by us were not involved in or aware of the incorrect pricing, we have taken and intend to take actions to deal with certain adverse tax consequences that may be incurred by the holders of certain incorrectly priced options. The primary adverse tax consequence is that incorrectly priced stock options vesting after December 31, 2004 may subject the option holder to a penalty tax under IRC Section 409A (and, as applicable, similar penalty taxes under California and other state tax laws). We recorded $10.1 million as other charges in operating expense for 2006 in relation to these items and other tax related items. We expect to incur future charges to resolve the adverse tax consequences of incorrectly priced options We misclassified the gains and losses from the retirement of our treasury shares in fiscal 2004. Accordingly, we reduced our retained earnings (accumulated deficit) as of December 31, 2004 and 2005 by $63.6 million with a corresponding increase to additional paid in capital. The impact of recognizing additional stock compensation and other adjustments on each component of stockholders equity at the end of each year is summarized as follows (in millions): Common Stock Additional Paid In Deferred Stock Net Impact to Fiscal Year Capital Compensation Accumulated Deficit Stockholders Equity 1998 $ $ $ $ 1999 215.3 (200.0 ) (15.3 ) 2000 479.6 (278.0 ) (201.6 ) 2001 74.9 413.2 (488.1 ) 2002 21.5 26.5 (48.0 ) 2003 (10.6 ) 19.2 (8.6 ) Subtotal 780.7 (19.1 ) (761.6 ) 2004 41.3 11.3 (71.1 ) (18.5 ) 2005 204.6 5.7 (3.3 ) 207.0 Total $ 1,026.6 $ (2.1 ) $ (836.0 ) $ 188.5 NASDAQ Listing Status In August 2006, we received a NASDAQ Staff Determination letter stating that, as a result of the delayed filing of our quarterly report on Form 10 Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 (the Second Quarter Form 10 Q), we were not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing as set forth in Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) and were therefore subject to delisting from the NASDAQ Global Select Market. In November 2006, we received an additional letter from NASDAQ of similar substance related to our Form 10 Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 (the Third Quarter Form 10 Q). In December 2006, the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel granted our request for continued listing, provided that we file a written summary of our audit committees findings with NASDAQ as well as the Second Quarter Form 10 Q, the Third Quarter Form 10 Q and any required restatements with the SEC on or before February 12, 2007. In January 2007, we received a notice from the NASDAQ Listing and Hearings Review Council which advised us that any delisting determination by the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel has been stayed pending further review by the Review Council. We have been given until March 30, 2007 to submit additional information to assist the Review Council in their assessment of our listing status. On February 20, 2007, we filed a written summary of our Audit Committees findings with NASDAQ. In addition, on March 9, 2007, we filed the Second Quarter Form 10 Q and the Third Quarter Form 10 Q with the SEC. We consider that the filing of these materials has remedied our non compliance with Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14), subject to NASDAQs affirmative completion of its compliance protocols and its notification to us accordingly. However, if NASDAQ disagrees with our position or if the SEC disagrees with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported, or not reported, the financial impact of past stock option grants, there could be further delays in filing subsequent SEC reports or other actions that might result in delisting of our common stock from the NASDAQ Global Select Market. Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets We recorded a $1,280.0 million non cash goodwill impairment charge in our consolidated statements of operations within the SLT segment to adjust the estimated carrying value of our goodwill for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006. The impairment of goodwill was primarily attributable to the decline in the Companys market capitalization that occurred over a period of approximately six months prior to the impairment review and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in the forecasted future cash flows used in the income approach. Future impairment indicators, including further declines in our market capitalization or a decrease in revenue or profitability levels, could require additional impairment charges to be recorded. 36 Table of Contents We evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flow the asset is expected to generate. If an asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment charge to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. We assess the recoverability of our long lived and intangible assets by determining whether the unamortized balances can be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows of the related assets. The amount of impairment, if any, is measured based on projected discounted future net cash flows. In 2006 and 2005, we recorded impairment charges of $3.4 million and $5.9 million, respectively, related to certain Kagoor purchased intangibles as a result of a significant reduction in our forecasted revenue associated with the session border control products. Stock Based Compensation We adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R effective January 1, 2006, using the modified prospective transition method and, therefore, have not revised prior periods results. During 2006, we issued stock options to the members of our Board (outside directors) and stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and shares of common stock pursuant to equity incentive plans. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, our Board of Directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of certain unvested and out of the money stock options that had an exercise price per share equal to or greater than $22.00, all of which were previously granted under our stock option plans and that were outstanding on December 16, 2005. The options accelerated excluded options previously granted to certain employees, including all of the executive officers and the Board of Directors of Juniper Networks. Under SFAS 123R, we recorded pre tax stock based compensation expense of $87.6 million in 2006 compared to $22.3 million in 2005 when we recognized stock based compensation expense under the intrinsic value recognition provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25). Beginning in May 2006, we have adopted the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (2006 Plan) which provides for a maximum term of seven years from the grant date for non statutory stock options and for incentive stock options (except that the maximum term is five years from the grant date for incentive stock options granted to a holder of more than 10% of the Companys stock). The 2006 Plan also provides for a defined option granting schedule for our outside directors. Details of the 2006 Plan are described in Note 6, Stockholders Equity, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K. Stock Repurchase Activities In July 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program. This program authorized repurchases of up to $250.0 million of our common stock. In the first quarter of 2006, we repurchased and retired 10,071,100 shares of common stock at an average price of $18.51 per share as part of our Common Stock Repurchase Program. No shares were repurchased after the three months ended March 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, a total of 12,939,700 common shares had been repurchased and retired since the inception of the program, equating to approximately $250.0 million at an average price of $19.32 per share. In July 2006, our Board authorized a new stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our Companys common stock. In February 2007, our Board approved an increase of $1.0 billion under this new share repurchase program. Coupled with the original $1.0 billion approved in July 2006, we are now authorized to repurchase up to $2.0 billion of our common stock. Purchases under this plan will be subject to a review of the circumstances in place at the time. Acquisitions under the share repurchase program will be made from time to time as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. The program may be discontinued at any time. Business Acquisitions We had no acquisitions in the year ended December 31, 2006. We completed a total of six acquisitions in the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. The main purposes of these acquisitions were to expand our product portfolio and customer base. The results of the following acquisitions have been included in our consolidated statements of operations beginning on their respective acquisition dates. The following is a summary of our acquisitions in 2004 and 2005: Funk Software, Inc. (Funk) acquired on December 1, 2005: Developed and sold products designed to protect the integrity of the network by verifying users and devices that meet an organizations security policies before granting network access. 37 Table of Contents Acorn Packet Solutions, Inc. (Acorn) acquired on October 20, 2005: Developed and sold products that enable migration from circuit based networks to more flexible and cost effective IP networks. Peribit Networks, Inc. (Peribit) acquired on July 1, 2005: Developed and sold products that enhance wide area network (WAN) optimization and application delivery. Redline Networks, Inc. (Redline) acquired on May 2, 2005: Developed and sold application front end platforms for enterprise data centers and public web sites. Kagoor Networks, Inc. (Kagoor) acquired on May 1, 2005: Developed and sold session border control products to enhance voice over Internet Protocol networking for communication carriers. NetScreen Technologies, Inc. (NetScreen) acquired on April 16, 2004: Developed and sold a broad array of integrated network security solutions for enterprises, service providers, and government entities. Acquisition Related Liabilities In connection with our acquisitions, we recorded liabilities associated with severance, future lease, and other obligations. The initial liabilities were recorded as part of the acquisitions and did not impact the consolidated statements of operations. The following is a summary of these liabilities: In 2005, we recorded liabilities of $4.5 million for the five acquisitions of that year, primarily related to future lease, severance, and other contractual obligations. As of December 31, 2006, there was $1.2 million remaining to be paid, primarily related to future leases that extend through 2009 and other contractual obligations. At the time of the NetScreen acquisition in 2004, we accrued $21.3 million primarily related to professional services, severance and facility charges. As of December 31, 2006, there was approximately $1.6 million remaining to be paid, primarily for facility leases that extend through 2008. At the time of the acquisition of Unisphere Networks, Inc. (Unisphere) in 2002, we accrued $14.8 million primarily related to professional services, severance and facility charges. As of December 31, 2006, there was approximately $0.8 million remaining to be paid, primarily for facility leases that extend through March 2011. Restructuring and Other Related Charges Restructuring Reserves We initiated restructuring plans to eliminate certain duplicative activities, focus on strategic product and customer bases, reduce cost structure and better align product and operating expenses with existing general economic conditions. The following is a summary of our restructuring plans charged to operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations: In 2006, we implemented a restructuring plan which provided for a reduction of 33 employees within the Infrastructure segment during the second and third quarters of 2006. Total accrual of $2.1 million, consisting primarily of severance and purchase commitment charges, was recognized as restructuring charges in operating expense and cost of product revenues in 2006. As of December 31, 2006, we had related restructuring reserves of $0.1 million recorded in short term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. In 2004, we implemented a restructuring plan at the time of the acquisition of NetScreen. We initially recorded a charge of approximately $0.4 million primarily related to workforce reduction costs, which has been completely paid as of December 31, 2006. In 2003, we implemented a restructuring plan, under which we announced that we would no longer develop our G series CMTS products and recorded a charge that was comprised of workforce reduction costs, non inventory asset impairment, costs associated with vacating facilities and terminating contracts and other related costs. We initially recorded a charge of approximately $14.0 million that was comprised of workforce reduction costs, non inventory asset impairment, vacating facilities costs, the costs associated with termination of contracts and other related costs. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $1.0 million remained unpaid primarily for a facility lease that extends through July 2008. 38 Table of Contents In 2002, we implemented a restructuring plan at the time of the Unisphere acquisition. We initially recorded a charge of $14.9 million, of which approximately $0.5 million remained unpaid as of December 31, 2006, primarily for facility leases that extend through April 2009. We adjusted our restructuring reserves primarily due to changes in lease and sublease assumptions as our needs changed as a result of our recent acquisitions and as the real estate markets changed. See Note 5 in Item 8 for a complete description of all restructuring charges and the amounts remained to be paid. Tax Repatriation We repatriated $225.0 million under the American Jobs Creation Act (Jobs Act) in 2005. We recorded a net tax benefit in 2005 of $19.7 million related to this repatriation dividend. The net tax benefit consists of a federal and state tax provision, net of federal benefit, of $9.7 million, offset by a tax benefit of $29.4 million related to an adjustment of deferred tax liabilities on un repatriated earnings. Nature of Expenses We have an extensive distribution channel in place that we use to target new customers and increase sales. We have made substantial investments in our distribution channel during 2006, 2005 and 2004. Most of our manufacturing, repair and supply chain operations are outsourced to independent contract manufacturers; accordingly, most of our cost of revenues consists of payments to our independent contract manufacturers for the standard product costs. The independent contract manufacturers produce our products using design specifications, quality assurance programs and standards that we establish. Controls around manufacturing, engineering and documentation are conducted at our facilities in Sunnyvale, California and Westford, Massachusetts. Our independent contract manufacturers have facilities primarily in Canada, China, Malaysia, and the United States. We generally do not own the components and title to products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon shipment. The contract manufacturers procure components based on our build forecasts and if actual component usage is lower than our forecasts, we may be, and have been in the past, liable for carrying or obsolete material charges. Employee related costs have historically been the primary driver of our operating expenses and we expect this trend to continue. Employee related costs include items such as wages, commissions, bonuses, vacation, benefits and travel. We added over 688 employees in 2006 primarily in engineering and customer service functions as a result of increased investment in customer service operations to support investment in the enterprise market. In 2005, we added 420 employees across all functions primarily as a result of acquisitions. We had 4,833, 4,145 and 2,948 employees as of December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Facility and information technology departmental costs are allocated to other departments based on headcount. These departmental costs have increased each of the last two years due to increases in headcount and facility leases resulting from acquisitions and additional infrastructure systems to support our growth. We expect to further invest in our internal information technology infrastructure in 2007. Research and development expenses include: The costs of developing our products from components to prototypes to finished products, Outside services for such services as certifications of new products, and expenditures associated with equipment used for testing. Several components of our research and development effort require significant expenditures, such as the development of new components and the purchase of prototype equipment, the timing of which can cause quarterly variability in our expenses. We expense our research and development costs as they are incurred. We plan to increase our investment in research and development during 2007 compared to 2006 to further advance our competitive advantage. 39 Table of Contents Sales and marketing expenses include costs for promoting our products and services, demonstration equipment and advertisements. These costs vary quarter to quarter depending on revenues, product launches and marketing initiatives. We plan to continue our investment in sales and marketing activities in both direct and channel sales. We will expand into new markets, particularly emerging markets, and continue to expand both our service provider and enterprise focus. We will also further develop our distribution channel in 2007 in an effort to expand and grow our presence in new markets, serving both private and public networks with a full portfolio of networking products. General and administrative expenses include professional fees, bad debt provisions and other corporate expenses. Professional fees include legal, audit, tax, accounting and certain corporate strategic services. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period. We regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from managements estimates. To the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future results of operations will be affected. We believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition. Our products are integrated with software that is essential to the functionality of our equipment. Additionally, we provide unspecified upgrades and enhancements related to our integrated software through our maintenance contracts for most of its products. Accordingly, we accounts for revenue in accordance with Statement of Position No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, and all related interpretations. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery or performance has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Evidence of an arrangement generally consists of customer purchase orders and, in certain instances, sales contracts or agreements. Shipping terms and related documents, or written evidence of customer acceptance, when applicable, are used to verify delivery or performance. We assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and the customers payment history to us. For arrangements with multiple elements, we allocate revenue to each element using the residual method based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered items. Vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately We then recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with our policies for product and service revenue recognition. Our ability to recognize revenue in the future may be affected if actual selling prices are significantly less than fair value. In addition, our ability to recognize revenue in the future could be impacted by conditions imposed by our customers. For sales to direct end users and value added resellers, we recognize product revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss, which is generally upon shipment. For our end users and value added resellers, there are no significant obligations for future performance such as rights of return or pricing credits. A portion of our sales are made through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits and or rights of return. We recognize product revenue on sales made through these distributors upon sell through as reported to us by the distributors. We recognize service revenue as the services are completed or ratably over the period of the obligation. We record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments, such as rebates and price protection, in the same period that the related revenue is recorded. The amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns and price protection credits, specific criteria included in rebate agreements, and other factors known at the time. Additional reductions to revenue would result if actual product returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of any of our customers was to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of its ability to make payments, additional allowances could be required. 40 Table of Contents Contract Manufacturer Liabilities. We outsource most of our manufacturing, repair and supply chain management operations to our independent contract manufacturers and a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of payments to them. Our independent contract manufacturers procure components and manufacture our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts are based on our estimates of future demand for our products, which are in turn based on historical trends and an analysis from our sales and marketing organizations, adjusted for overall market conditions. We establish reserves for carrying charges and obsolete material charges for excess components purchased based on historical trends. If the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecasted, which may be caused by factors outside of our control, we have contractual liabilities and exposures with the independent contract manufacturers, such as carrying costs and obsolete material exposures, which would have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability. Warranty Reserve. We generally offer a one year warranty on all of our hardware products and a 90 day warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the products. We establish reserves for estimated product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized. Although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, use of materials and technical labor costs and associated overhead incurred in correcting any product failure. Should actual product failure rates, use of materials or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, additional warranty reserves could be required, which could reduce gross margins. Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets. Goodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. The amounts and useful lives assigned to other intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization, and the amount assigned to in process research and development is expensed immediately. The value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, could be impacted by future adverse changes such as: (i) future declines in our operating results, (ii) a decline in the valuation of technology company stocks, including the valuation of our common stock, (iii) significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or the networking industry or (iv) failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results. We evaluate these assets on an annual basis as of November 1 or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. In the process of our annual impairment review, we use the market approach as well as the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method to determine the fair value of our intangible assets. Significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation. The estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business. It is possible, however, that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect. If our actual results, or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses, are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets, we could incur additional impairment charges. Stock Based Compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. Under the provisions of SFAS 123R, stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the awards fair value as calculated by the Black Scholes Merton (BSM) option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period. The BSM model requires various highly subjective assumptions including volatility, forfeiture rates, and expected option life. If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly, stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. In conjunction with the adoption of SFAS 123R, we also adopted the single approach method for valuing our stock based awards as well as the straight line method for amortizing the related stock based compensation expense. In connection with our restatement of the consolidated financial statements, we have applied judgment in choosing whether to revise measurement dates and if revised which measurement date to select for prior option grants. Information regarding the restatement, including ranges of possible additional stock based compensation expense if other measurement dates had been selected for certain grants, is set forth above under Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements and in Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K. Income Taxes. Estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences and carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income based on the realization criteria set forth under SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe to be more likely than not realizable. We believe it is more likely than not that forecasted income together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event 41 Table of Contents that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Similarly, if we subsequently realize deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation allowance would be reversed, resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings or a decrease in goodwill in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities may result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimate of tax liabilities is less than the amount ultimately assessed, a further charge to expense would result. Litigation and Settlement Costs. From time to time, we are involved in disputes, litigation and other legal actions. We are aggressively defending our current litigation matters; however, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and we cannot assure you that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation and or substantial settlement charges. In addition, the resolution of any future intellectual property litigation may require us to make royalty payments, which could adversely impact gross margins in future periods. If any of those events were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We record a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the range of loss can be reasonably estimated. However, the actual liability in any such litigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to record additional expenses. Loss Contingencies. We are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required. Results of Operations The following table illustrates certain statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of net revenues: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 As Restated (1) As Restated (1) Net revenues 100 % 100 % 100 % Cost of revenues 33 % 32 % 31 % Gross margin 67 % 68 % 69 % Operating expenses: Research and development 21 % 17 % 20 % Sales and marketing 24 % 21 % 25 % General and administrative 4 % 4 % 4 % Amortization of purchased intangible assets 4 % 4 % 4 % In process research and development 1 % 2 % Impairment of goodwill and intangibles 56 % Other charges, net 2 % Total operating expenses 111 % 47 % 55 % (Loss) income from operations (44 %) 21 % 14 % (1) See Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The increases in revenues, cost of expenses, and operating expenses in 2006 compared to 2005 were attributable to continued growth primarily driven by increased sales resulting from the consolidation in the large service providers market and increased success in the enterprise market in key areas like the U.S. Federal Government. In particular, we experienced sales growth in the emerging markets in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Asia, as well as significant growth in our sales to the top 10 world wide service 42 Table of Contents providers. Our service revenue grew substantially as a result of an increased equipment base, increased attach rates (the rate that purchases of equipment are accompanied by purchases of related services) on new sales and new professional services. The cost of revenues and operating expenses increases were directly attributable to the revenue growth and investments in research and development efforts. In addition, we recognized impairment and other charges in 2006. Net Revenues The following table shows total net product and service revenues and net product and service revenues as a percentage of total net revenues (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Net product revenues $ 1,893.3 82 % $ 1,771.0 86 % $ 1,162.9 87 % Net service revenues 410.3 18 % 293.0 14 % 173.1 13 % Total net revenues $ 2,303.6 100 % $ 2,064.0 100 % $ 1,336.0 100 % Our total net revenues increased $239.6 million, or 12%, to $2,303.6 million in 2006. Our total net revenues increased by $728.0 million, or 54%, to $2,064.0 million in 2005. Net Product Revenues The $122.3 million, or 7%, increase in our product net revenue from 2005 to 2006 was the result of increased activity in both service provider and enterprise markets. In particular we had success in selling our products to customers who are adopting next generation networks (NGN) IP networks, which are designed to reduce total operating costs and to be able to offer multiple services over a single network. In addition we had a number of new product releases during 2006 and expanded into new emerging markets. During 2006 and 2005, we recognized $4.2 million and $32.7 million, respectively, of product net revenue from shipments made to end users and value added resellers that were deferred at the end of the prior year. Infrastructure products accounted for $1,413.4 million or 75% of our total net product revenues during 2006 and $1,371.6 million or 77% of our total net product revenues during 2005. Infrastructure product net revenue grew by $41.8 million or 3% from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to continued success from a very significant year of growth in 2005, which strengthened our position as a supplier to the largest service providers in the world, particularly in the United States and in EMEA. This success was partially offset by a pause in the build out of NGNs and associated purchase decisions, particularly in Japan, as major carriers prepare for the next stage of bandwidth and services expansion, and a large product revenue deferral for products shipped to Verizon that is expected to be recognized in 2007. Infrastructure product net revenue increased 40.6% from 2004 to 2005, primarily due to the increase in revenues from service providers and enterprises as a result of significant success selling into the broadband and core networks for the service providers across the world and the recognition in the market place of Juniper Networks world class service provider solutions. SLT products accounted for $479.9 million or 25% of our total product revenue in 2006 and $399.4 million or 23% of total net product revenues during 2005. SLT product net revenue increased $80.5 million or 20% from 2005 to 2006 due to a growing demand and brand recognition for our Security products from large enterprises and the U.S. Federal Government. In addition, the new products announced in 2006 and those added to our portfolio through the various acquisitions in 2005 contributed to this increase. In addition, we experienced good success in selling SLT products to service providers for both their own IT infrastructure and resale. Our SLT product revenue increase in 2005 was primarily driven by the increased demands in security products by the enterprise market. Additionally, the acquisitions completed in 2005 enabled us to cross sell infrastructure, security, and application acceleration products to existing customer bases. An analysis of the change in revenue by Infrastructure and SLT segments, and the change in units, can be found below in the section titled Segment Information. 43 Table of Contents Net Service Revenues Net service revenues increased $117.3 million or 40% from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to an increase in the customer installed base that we are servicing, as well as increased attach rates on new product sales, improved enterprise service infrastructure allowing more rapid implementation of services and the addition of new professional service offerings. Professional service revenue also increased, to a lesser extent, in 2006 compared to 2005 due primarily to maintenance related on site engineering services as well as additional consulting projects in 2006. Net service revenues increased $119.9 million or 69% from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to the growth in support services and, to a lesser degree, the growth in professional services. A majority of our service revenue is earned from customers who purchase our products and enter into service contracts that are typically for one year renewable periods. The increases in support service revenue were primarily due to the additional technical support service contract initiations associated with higher product sales, which have resulted in increased renewal and a larger installed base of equipment being serviced. These contracts are typically for services such as 24 hour customer support, non specified updates and hardware repairs. We recognize revenue from service contracts as the services are completed or ratably over the period of the obligation. In addition to support services and professional services, we also provide educational services. Total Net Revenues The following table shows net revenue by geographic region (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Americas: United States $ 953.0 41 % $ 879.0 43 % $ 561.5 42 % Other 78.4 4 % 53.9 2 % 47.6 4 % Total Americas 1,031.4 45 % 932.9 45 % 609.1 46 % Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) 812.7 35 % 610.1 30 % 380.5 28 % Asia Pacific: Japan 159.3 7 % 204.8 10 % 155.7 12 % Other 300.2 13 % 316.2 15 % 190.7 14 % Total Asia Pacific 459.5 20 % 521.0 25 % 346.4 26 % Total $ 2,303.6 100 % $ 2,064.0 100 % $ 1,336.0 100 % We continue to experience varying distribution of revenue among our three geographic theaters, and we expect this trend to continue. Net revenue in the United States increased by $74.0 million in 2006 from 2005 due to continued success both with enterprise customers such as the U.S. Federal Government, as well as with major service providers in the United States. The increase was also due in part to sales to major internet content providers and the cable providers. This success was partially offset by a significant product revenue deferral for product shipped to Verizon. Net revenue in the United States as a percentage of total net revenue decreased by two percentage points in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of the strong growth in EMEA. Total 2006 revenue recorded by the Americas region grew by $98.5 million from its 2005 level and remained at 45% of worldwide revenue, as compared to 2005, due to significant success with the main service providers in Canada and various South American countries including Brazil and Argentina. Revenue in the EMEA region grew by $202.6 million or five percentage points in 2006 due to significant success with NGN deployments across the region, in particular Sweden, the Netherlands, France, and Germany, as well as sales growth in emerging regions including Russia, Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Revenue from the Asia Pacific region declined $61.5 million or 12% primarily due to the impact of certain NGN project decision delays in Japan driving revenue down year over year, partially offset by increased demands in China. Net revenue in the United States as a percentage of total net revenue increased from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to the growth driven by increased demand within the service provider and enterprise markets. Net revenue in EMEA as a percentage of total net revenue increased in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to strength across the region, including Germany and the United Kingdom. Net revenue in other Asia Pacific countries as a percentage of total net revenue remained fairly consistent with prior years. Siemens accounted for greater than 10% of our net product and service revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, 2004. We expect that our largest customers, as well as key strategic partners, will continue to account for a substantial portion of our 44 Table of Contents net revenue in 2007 and for the foreseeable future particularly due to the consolidation that continues to impact both our customers and partners. Cost of Revenues The following table shows cost of product and service revenues and the related gross margin (GM) percentages (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2006 GM% 2005 GM% 2004 GM% As Restated (1) As Restated (1) Cost of product revenues $ 555.1 71% $ 506.3 71% $ 318.8 73% Cost of service revenues 199.2 51% 147.2 50% 96.3 44% Total cost of revenues $ 754.3 67% $ 653.5 68% $ 415.1 69% (1) See Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Cost of Product Revenues Cost of product revenues increased $48.8 million or 10% in 2006 as compared to 2005. The increase was primarily attributable to increased product revenue in both the enterprise and service provider markets. Net product gross margin of 71% for 2006 fell by less than one percentage point compared to that in 2005 despite increased competitive pressure due to the impact of the mix of products; the mix of territories and reduced manufacturing costs. We expect to see increasing price competition and downward pressure on our product gross margins in the future. The increase in stock compensation expense in cost of product revenue from 2005 to 2006 of $0.9 million was primarily due to the impact of adopting SFAS 123R in 2006. The two percentage point decrease in product gross margins from 2004 to 2005 was primarily due to increasing competition as certain of our products have become more mature in their product cycles. As we expanded our market share and entered more markets since 2004, we experienced increasing price competition. Nevertheless, higher product revenue volume contributed to the increased gross margin by $420.6 million, or 50%, in 2005 when compared to 2004. Cost of Service Revenues Cost of service revenues increased $52.0 million in 2006 as compared to that in 2005. The increase was a direct result of a larger installed base of products covered by service contracts. However, our service gross margin increased one percentage point from 2005 to 2006 as a result of improved efficiencies and economies of scale, which result in a better leveraged service organization. Total employee salary and related expenses as a percentage of service revenue were: 20% for 2006, 20% for 2005 and 26% for 2004; however, in absolute dollars, employee salary and related expenses increased $22.3 million from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to an investment in new customer service personnel, particularly to support our enterprise customers. Stock compensation expense in cost of service revenue also increased by $4.1 million from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to the impact of adopting SFAS 123R in 2006. In addition to personnel expenses, outside services costs increased $7.1 million from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to contracting for engineers to provide professional services revenue, particularly for the Middle East and other emerging markets. Spares and shipping expenses increased $7.3 million and $5.6 million, respectively, from 2005 to 2006 due to a significant investment in spares around the world to support the increase in customer contracts, particularly in the enterprise market. Finally, the costs associated with facilities, depreciation and other expenses increased $4.9 million in cost of service revenue from 2005 to 2006 due to increases in revenue and investment in infrastructure to support the growing business. Service gross margins increased six percentage points from 2004 to 2005 and, increase was primarily attributable to a larger revenue increase when compared to the increase in cost of headcount, outside services, and spares purchases, all of which were needed to support the growing installed base. Total employee related expenses as a percentage of service revenue for 2005 decreased to 20% compared to 26% in 2004. Nevertheless, in absolute dollars, total service related costs increased $50.9 million from 2004 to 2005: employee related expenses increased $20.2 million, and outside service expenses increased by $17.5 million as a result of increased headcount during 2005. In addition, expense associated with spares increased by $7.1 million. 45 Table of Contents Research and Development, Sales and Marketing and General and Administrative Expenses The following table shows research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses amounts and as a percentage of total net revenues (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 As Restated (1) As Restated (1) Research and development $ 480.2 21 % $ 357.3 17 % $ 264.4 20 % Sales and marketing 558.0 24 % 441.6 21 % 324.3 24 % General and administrative 97.1 4 % 75.0 4 % 55.5 4 % (1) See Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses increased $122.9 million, or four percentage points of net revenue, in 2006 over 2005 as a result of our focus on the development of a broader portfolio of networking products. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases in personnel related expenses of $61.7 million, depreciation of $12.4 million, facility related expenses of $10.5 million, engineering and testing expenses of $8.3 million, outside service expenses of $3.5 million and equipment related expenses of $2.1 million. The increases in personnel related expenses in 2006 were primarily due to additional hires in the engineering organization across the Infrastructure and SLT segments. Headcount increased 19% from 1,736 individuals to 2,070 individuals during 2006. The headcount increase was attributable to product innovation efforts in areas including routers security and integration in order to capture potential future NGN infrastructure growth and other opportunities in the enterprise and the service provider markets. To a lesser extent, the increases in personnel expenses were attributable to merit based salary increases beginning in April 2006. Facility, engineering and testing expense increased in 2006 to support our product innovation efforts. Outside service expenses increased in 2006 primarily due to additional consulting projects on developing future product roadmaps. The increase in stock compensation expense in research and development expenses from 2005 to 2006 of $24.0 million was primarily due to the impact of adopting SFAS 123R in 2006. We continue to invest in both stand alone as well as integrated products in order to satisfy our customer needs. Our investment and expansion on our global research and development efforts were primarily in China and India. Research and development expenses increased $92.9 million in 2005 compared to 2004, but decreased by 3% of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases in personnel related expenses of $66.4 million, facility related expenses of $14.1 million, engineering and testing expenses of $12.6 million, equipment related expenses of $8.5 million, and depreciation of $5.1 million. The increases in personnel related expenses in 2005 were primarily due to additional hires in the engineering organization, including those from the five acquisitions. The increase was partially offset by the decrease in research and development related stock compensation expense of $14.3 million compared to 2004 as a result of forfeitures of unvested options in 2005 and additional compensation expense recorded as a result of our restatement discussed in Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we invested and expanded on our global research and development efforts, specifically in China and India. Sales and Marketing Expenses Sales and marketing expenses increased $116.4 million in 2006 compared to 2005 and increased as a percent of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases in personnel related expenses of $58.9 million, increases in facility related expense of $12.0 million, increases in travel expenses of $10.3 million, increases in marketing related activities of $6.6 million, and increases in equipment related expenses of $2.6 million. Personnel related expenses increased in 2006 primarily due to additional hires to support the expansion of our distribution channels and customer base, as well as to support the larger portfolio of products. In particular, we expanded our enterprise sales force, and targeted key growth areas such as China, Middle East and India. We added 171 individuals to our sales and marketing function during 2006. Travel expense increased in 2006 due primarily to increased headcount and more activity in emerging markets. Marketing related activities increased primarily as a result of specific activities designed to expand and improve our brand recognition, support of our distribution channels, introduction of new products, targeted solution value propositions and increase awareness of our existing products to a broader range of customers. Equipment related expenses increased in 2006 due to the introduction of new products. The increase in stock compensation expense in sales and marketing from 2005 to 2006 of $24.5 million was primarily due to the impact of adopting SFAS 123R in 2006. Sales and marketing expenses increased $117.3 million in 2005 compared to 2004 but decreased as a percent of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases in personnel related expenses of $97.3 million, increases in marketing 46 Table of Contents related activities of $10.9 million, and increases in equipment related expenses of $2.6 million. Personnel related expenses increased in 2005 primarily due to additional hires, including acquisitions, to support the expansion of our distribution channels and customer base, as well as to support the larger portfolio of products. Marketing related activities increased primarily as a result of specific activities designed to expand and improve our distribution channels, introduction of new products, and increase awareness of our existing products to a broader range of customers. Stock based compensation pertaining to sales and marketing functions was $6.8 million and $22.0 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased $22.1 million in 2006 compared to 2005 and remained at 4% of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was driven by increases in personnel related expenses of $5.6 million and other related expense. General and administrative world wide headcount increased 11%, or by 24 individuals, during 2006, to support the overall growth in the business. The net change in bad debt expense reversal increased $2.3 million due primarily to the bad debt expense reversal in 2005. Facility and IT related expense increased $1.2 million as a result of our personnel growth and development of our systems infrastructure. The increase of general and administrative related stock compensation expense from 2005 to 2006 of $11.8 million was primarily due to the impact of adopting SFAS 123R in 2006. General and administrative expenses increased $19.5 million in 2005 compared to 2004 and remained at 4% of total net revenues. The increase in absolute dollars was driven by increases in personnel related expenses of $10.6 million and a $10.0 million patent related expense. The $10.0 million patent expense pertained to an agreement we entered into with a third party to avoid future disputes. Stock based compensation pertaining to general and administrative function was $1.2 million and $2.2 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Other Operating Expenses The following table shows other operating expenses (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Amortization of purchased intangible assets $ 91.8 $ 85.2 $ 56.8 Impairment of goodwill and intangibles 1,283.4 5.9 In process research and development 11.0 27.5 Other charges, net: Restructuring and acquisition related charges, net 5.9 (6.5 ) (5.1 ) Integration costs 5.1 Stock option investigation costs 20.5 Tax related charges 10.1 Total other charges, net $ 36.5 $ (6.5 ) $ Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets Amortization of purchased intangible assets increased $6.6 million in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of recognizing a full year of amortization associated with the five acquisitions completed in 2005. The amortization of purchased intangible assets increased $28.4 million in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to the additional intangible assets from the five acquisitions completed in 2005. See Note 3 in Item 8 for more information on our purchased intangible assets. Impairment of Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets Impairment charges increased by $1,283.4 million in 2006 as a result of the impairment of both goodwill and purchased intangible assets during 2006. Due primarily to the decline in the Companys market capitalization that occurred over a period of approximately six months prior to the impairment review and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in the forecasted future cash flows used in the income approach, we evaluated the carrying value of our goodwill and reduced the goodwill within the SLT segment by $1,280.0 million. In addition, we recorded a $3.4 million impairment expense pertaining to a write down of intangible assets as a result of a decrease in forecasted revenue for the SBC stand alone products during the second quarter of 2006. In 2005, we wrote down $5.9 million of purchased intangible assets acquired from Kagoor. 47 Table of Contents In Process Research and Development No charges related to in process research and development were incurred in 2006. In 2005, a total of $11.0 million was charged to IPRD expense in connection with three of our five acquisitions during the year. Of the total Funk purchase price, $5.3 million was allocated to in process research and development (IPRD). Of the total Peribit purchase price, $3.8 million was allocated to IPRD. Of the total Kagoor purchase price, $1.9 million was allocated to IPRD. None of the Acorn or Redline purchase prices were allocated to IPRD. In 2004, $27.5 million was allocated to IPRD from the NetScreen acquisition and was expensed during the year. Projects that qualify as IPRD represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and which have no alternative future use. Technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to a beta phase working prototype in which there is no remaining risk relating to the development. At the time of acquisition, Funk, Peribit, Kagoor, and NetScreen had multiple IPRD efforts under way for certain current and future product lines. For Funk, these efforts included development of new versions for the Steel Belted Radius (SBR), SBR High Availability (HA), and Mobile IP Module (MIM) II products all related to the Radius product offering. IPRD as of the acquisition date also included development of new versions for Endpoint Assurance, Proxy (Remote Control), and Odyssey product families. At the time of the Funk acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts will be completed over the next four months at an estimated cost of approximately $0.9 million. For Peribit, these efforts included the development of next versions of software for the Sequence Reducer (SR) family, Sequence Mirror (SM) family, the Central Management System (CMS) products, as well as a hardware program for both the SR and SM families. At the time of the Peribit acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over the next twelve months at an estimated cost of approximately $2.3 million. For Kagoor, these efforts included a variety of signaling protocols and next generation products and operating systems. At the time of the Kagoor acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over the next eight months at an estimated cost of approximately $0.8 million. For NetScreen, these efforts included integrating secure routers with embedded encryption chips, as well as other functions and features such as next generation Internet Protocol (IP), wireless and digital subscriber line connectivity and voice over IP capability. We utilized the discounted cash flow (DCF) method to value the IPRD, using rates ranging from 20% to 25%, depending on the estimated useful life of the technology. In applying the DCF method, the value of the acquired technology was estimated by discounting to present value the free cash flows expected to be generated by the products with which the technology is associated, over the remaining economic life of the technology. To distinguish between the cash flows attributable to the underlying technology and the cash flows attributable to other assets available for generating product revenues, adjustments were made to provide for a fair return to fixed assets, working capital, and other assets that provide value to the product lines. At the time of the NetScreen acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over the next eighteen months at an estimated cost of approximately $25.0 million. As of December 31, 2006, the estimated costs to complete the above research and development efforts were immaterial. Other Charges, Net Other charges are summarized as follows: Restructuring and Acquisition Related Reserves. We recorded net restructuring and acquisition related bonus expenses of $5.9 million in 2006, of which $5.6 million pertained to bonus accruals associated with the Funk and Acorn acquisitions and $0.3 million pertained to net restructuring related charges. During 2006, we accrued $0.7 million in restructuring charges due to the initiation of a restructuring plan which focused on some product development costs reductions and the discontinuation of our SBC product. The $6.5 million credit to restructuring and acquisition related expenses in 2005 primarily consisted of $6.9 million in adjustments related to our restructuring accrual when we re occupied a portion of the former NetScreen facility that was previously included in this acquisition related restructuring reserve, partially offset by a $0.3 million bonus and earn out accrual related to the Funk and Acorn acquisitions. In 2004, we also recorded net adjustments of $5.1 million to the previously established restructuring reserves primarily for changes in estimates related to changes in lease and sublease assumptions. 48 Table of Contents Integration Costs. We had no significant costs in either 2006 or 2005 related to the integration of acquired product lines or business units during those years. We recognized $5.1 million in integration costs for the NetScreen acquisition in 2004. Integration expenses are incremental costs directly related to the integration of the two companies. The integration expenses consisted principally of facility related expenses, workforce related expenses and professional fees. We estimate that the majority of the integration costs related to our 2005 and 2004 acquisitions have been incurred and that there will be an immaterial amount of additional integration costs for these acquisitions in the foreseeable future. Stock Option Investigation Costs. We recorded expenses of $20.5 million in 2006 relating to professional fees and other costs necessary to conduct our independent stock option investigation. Tax Related Charges. We recorded $10.1 million in operating expense during 2006 in relation to certain taxes associated with stock option grants to employees. Other Income and Expenses The following table shows other income and expenses (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Interest and other income $ 104.3 $ 59.1 $ 28.2 Interest and other expense (3.6 ) (3.9 ) (5.4 ) Write down of equity investments (0.4 ) (2.9 ) Loss on redemption of convertible subordinated notes (4.1 ) Gain on sale of equity or available for sale investments 1.7 Interest and other income increased $45.2 million from 2005 to 2006 and $30.9 million from 2004 to 2005 as a result of higher cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, and an increase in rates of return realized from our investments. Interest expense decreased $0.3 million from 2005 and 2006 primarily due to lower portfolio management fees. Interest and other expenses decreased $1.5 million from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to the retirement of our subordinated notes during 2004, resulting in savings of $2.5 million, which was partially offset by foreign exchange related losses from balance sheet revaluation and bank fees. We have certain minority equity investments in privately held companies that are carried at cost, adjusted for any impairment, as we do not have a controlling interest and do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over these companies. In 2006, there were no permanent changes in the market value of these holdings, and therefore we made no change to the valuation of these assets. During 2005 and 2004, we wrote down these investments by $0.4 million and $2.9 million respectively, for changes in market value that we believed were other than temporary. In 2005, we recorded a gain of $1.7 million in connection with a business combination transaction of a privately held company in our investment portfolio. Our cost basis of this equity investment was $1.0 million. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes decreased to $104.4 million in 2006 from $146.8 million in 2005. The 2006 effective rate was (11.6%) and differs from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the inability to benefit from a substantial portion of the goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2006. Provision for income taxes increased to $146.8 million in 2005 from $79.9 million in 2004. The 2005 effective rate was 29.5% and differs from the federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to the benefit of tax credits, income in foreign jurisdictions taxed at lower rates and a reduction in deferred tax liabilities related to the repatriation in 2005 of $225.0 million under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The provision for income taxes presented for 2005 and 2004 has been reduced by approximately $1.4 million and $3.4 million, respectively, due to the tax effect of the restatement for stock compensation charges. See Note 2 for additional details. 49 Table of Contents Segment Information A description of the products and services for each segment can be found in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We began to track financial information by our three operating segments during 2006 and 2005 as our management structure and responsibilities began to measure the business based on management operating income. We have included segment financial data for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006 for comparative purposes. Financial information for each operating segment used by management to make financial decisions and allocate resources is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 As Restated (1) As Restated (1) Net Revenues: Infrastructure $ 1,413.4 $ 1,371.6 $ 975.7 Service Layer Technologies 479.9 399.4 187.2 Service 410.3 293.0 173.1 Total net revenues 2,303.6 2,064.0 1,336.0 Operating Income: Management operating income: Infrastructure 420.0 487.4 304.4 Service Layer Technologies (12.8 ) 9.6 (5.5 ) Service 101.3 71.9 32.6 Total management operating income 508.5 568.9 331.5 Amortization of purchased intangible assets (2) (97.3 ) (85.2 ) (56.8 ) Stock based compensation expense (87.6 ) (22.3 ) (54.9 ) Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets (1,283.4 ) (5.9 ) In process research and development (11.0 ) (27.5 ) Other expense, net (3) (38.0 ) (3.5 ) Total operating (loss) income (997.8 ) 441.0 192.3 Interest and other income 104.3 59.1 28.2 Interest and other expense (3.6 ) (3.9 ) (5.4 ) Gain on (write down of) investment, net 1.3 (2.9 ) Loss on redemption of convertible subordinated notes (4.1 ) (Loss) income before income taxes $ (897.1 ) $ 497.5 $ 208.1 (1) Stock based compensation expense for the 2005 and 2004 periods has been restated as a result of the stock option investigation. In addition, prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect the reorganization of certain research and development activities and changes in allocation methodologies. (2) Amount includes amortization expense of purchased intangible assets in operating expenses and in costs of revenues. (3) Other expense for 2006 includes charges such as restructuring, acquisition related charges, stock option investigation costs and tax related charges, as well as certain restructuring costs that were included in cost of revenues. Other expense for 2005 includes charges such as restructuring, acquisition related charges and patent related charges. Infrastructure Operating Segment Infrastructure segment net revenues increased from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to increases in revenue from higher end infrastructure chassis products and increased penetration by our core and edge router portfolio as a result service providers acquiring products for their NGNs and multi play service offerings. In addition we believe there is increased demand for our products due to the adoption and expansion of IP networks as a result of peer to peer interaction, increased broadband usage, video, IPTV and an increasing reliance on the network as a mission critical business tool in the strategies of our IP customers, and of their enterprise customers. Infrastructure segment net revenues increased from 2004 to 2005 due to the adoption and expansion of IP networks by our customers in order to reduce total operating costs and to be able to offer multiple services over a single network. We track Infrastructure revenue units recognized and ports shipped to analyze customer trends and indicate areas of potential network growth. Our infrastructure product platforms are essentially modular, with the chassis serving as the base of the platform. Each chassis has a certain number of slots that are available to be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces. The modules are the components through which the router receives incoming packets of data from a variety of transmission media. The physical connection between a transmission medium and a module is referred to as a port. The number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the functionality and throughput offered by the module. Chassis revenue units represent the number of chassis on 50 Table of Contents which revenue was recognized during the period. The following table shows infrastructure revenue units recognized and ports shipped: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Infrastructure chassis revenue units 10,211 9,977 7,102 Infrastructure ports shipped 160,318 153,763 115,255 Chassis revenue units increased from 2005 to 2006 due primarily to the sales of higher end T series and M series products and the inclusion of the chassis units related to a 2005 acquisition, partially offset by decreases in sales of lower end E series and M series products. Sales of higher end chassis units increased as our customers continued to adopt and expand IP networks in order to reduce total operating costs and to be able to offer multiple services over a single network. Port shipment units increased from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to the increase in port demands driven by the larger expansion capacity in the higher end chassis revenue units shipped during 2006, partially offset by the lower port capacity in CTP series chassis revenue units. Chassis revenue units increased from 2004 to 2005 due primarily to investment in new broadband and other service provider networks during this time. Port shipment units increased from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to the growth in subscribers and services utilizing the networks. Infrastructure management operating income decreased from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to higher personnel related costs associated with our investments in product innovation for next generation core and edge infrastructure products as well as increased operating expenses associated with marketing related efforts and improvements to our internal infrastructure, partially offset by savings in sales expense during 2006 as we increasingly leveraged our existing distribution channel. Infrastructure management operating income increased from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to increases in revenue as evident by the increase in chassis revenue units and the productivity leverage such increase created. The increase was partially offset by higher personnel related costs primarily related to support product innovation and the expansion of our sales channels. SLT Operating Segment The SLT operating segment consists of security products and application acceleration products. The following table shows SLT revenue units recognized: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 SLT revenue units 183,575 170,181 81,015 SLT net revenue increased from 2005 to 2006 primarily attributable to sales increases across various SLT product families including firewalls/VPN, IDP, J series, DX, and SSL/VPN. The full year of inclusion of the DX and application acceleration products from the acquisitions completed in 2005 also contributed to the SLT revenue increases in 2006. Another part of the increase was driven by cross selling our SLT products into service providers for internal use and managed services; and a further part of the increase was due to successfully selling to much larger enterprise customers with increased footprint and complexity. SLT net revenues increased from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to the NetScreen acquisition in 2004, and to a lesser extent, the Funk, Peribit, Redline, and Kagoor acquisitions and increases in the sales of firewall/VPN products in 2005. SLT segment incurred a management operating loss in 2006, compared to the management operating income in 2005, due primarily to higher product and personnel related costs despite the higher SLT net revenues and gross margin. Increases in personnel related costs were primarily related to headcount growth in order to support product innovation, new products sales and a larger customer base. We have made a strategic decision to invest more into the enterprise and SLT markets to drive increased revenues and SLT productivity in the future. SLT Management operating income increased from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to increases in net revenue, partially offset by increased expenses primarily related to product innovation and the expansion of our sales channels. Additionally, the purchase accounting adjustments related to the NetScreen acquisition negatively impacted the revenue and management operating results in 2004. Service Operating Segment Net service revenues increased from 2005 to 2006 mainly due to the growth in support services, and to a lesser extent, the growth in professional services. The growth in the support services was largely due to increased technical support service contracts associated with higher product sales, which have resulted in our growing installed base of equipment being serviced. The growth in professional services was mainly due to resident engineering professional services and consulting projects in 2006. Service gross margin percentages as well as Service management operating income increased from 2005 to 2006 due primarily to improved economies of 51 Table of Contents scale achieved by faster revenue growth through the Infrastructure products and the SLT products relative to the increases in operating costs. In absolute dollars, employee related expenses increased in 2006 as a result of increased service related headcount from 476 to 611 individuals. Expenses associated with spare components also increased in 2006 to support increased demands driven by additional service contracts as a result of our growing installed base. Net service revenues increased in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to the growth in support services and, to a lesser degree, the growth in professional services. The growth in the support services was largely due to improved renewal rates and our growing installed base. Service management operating income increased as a result of the revenue growth experienced in the Infrastructure segment and the SLT segment, partially offset by increases in operating costs, primarily due to personnel related costs. In absolute dollars, employee related expenses increased as a result of increased headcount. Expenses associated with spares also increased as a result of revenue growth. Key Performance Measures In addition to the financial metrics included in the consolidated financial statements, we use the following key performance measure to assess operating results: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Days sales outstanding (DSO) (a) 38.5 42.5 39.6 (a) Days sales outstanding, or DSO, is calculated as the ratio of ending accounts receivable, net of allowances, divided by average daily net sales for the preceding 90 days. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview We have funded our business by issuing securities and through our operating activities. The following table shows our capital resources (in millions): As of December 31, 2006 2005 Working capital $ 1,759.2 $ 1,261.4 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,596.3 $ 918.4 Short term investments 443.9 510.4 Long term investments 574.1 618.3 Restricted cash 45.6 66.1 Working capital increased $497.8 million from 2005 to 2006 mainly due to cash provided by operating activities and investing activities, partially offset by cash used in financing activities. The significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, short term investments and accounts receivable, reduced by accounts payable, accrued liabilities and deferred revenue. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short term and long term investments, together with cash generated from operations and from the exercise of employee stock options and the purchase of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan, will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, commitments, repurchases of our common stock, and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations through at least the next 12 months. However, it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities beyond the next 12 months or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses, assets, products or technologies. We could raise such funds by selling equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors, or by borrowing money from financial institutions. In addition, even though we may not need additional funds, we may still elect to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons. There are no transactions, arrangements, and other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of our requirements for capital resources, except the $2.0 billion stock repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors as described below. If we were to purchase $2.0 billion of our common stock, we would significantly reduce our working capital and we may elect to obtain additional debt or credit facilities to fund the repurchases. Our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending on many factors, including: 52 Table of Contents the overall levels of sales of our products and gross profit margins; our business, product, capital expenditure and research and development plans; the market acceptance of our products; repurchase of our common stock; issuance and repayment of debt; litigation expenses, settlements and judgments; volume price discounts and customer rebates; the levels of accounts receivable that we maintain; acquisitions of other businesses, assets, products or technologies; changes in our compensation policies; capital improvements for new and existing facilities; technological advances; our competitors responses to our products; our relationships with suppliers and customers; expenses related to our future restructuring plans, if any; legal and professional service fees associated with our stock option investigation activities; tax expense associated with stock based awards; issuance of stock based awards and the related payment in cash for withholding taxes in the current year and possibly during future years; the level of exercises of stock options and stock purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan; and general economic conditions and specific conditions in our industry and markets, including the effects of recent international conflicts and related uncertainties. Cash Requirements In July 2006, our Board authorized a new stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our Companys common stock. In February 2007, our Board approved an increase of $1.0 billion under this new share repurchase program. Coupled with the original $1.0 billion approved in July 2006, we are now authorized to repurchase up to $2.0 billion of our common stock. Purchases under this plan will be subject to a review of the circumstances in place at the time. Acquisitions under the share repurchase program will be made from time to time as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. The program may be discontinued at any time. In May 2006, our audit committee commenced an independent review of our stock option practices and related accounting. The audit committee was assisted by independent legal counsel and accounting experts. We recognized $20.5 million of expense for legal and other professional services associated with this stock option review through December 31, 2006. In addition, we incurred tax related charges of $10.1 million in 2006. We expect to incur additional fees and other costs in 2007. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at December 31, 2006 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in millions): Less Than More than Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Operating leases, net of committed subleases (a) $ 182.2 $ 40.8 $ 60.9 $ 47.0 $ 33.5 Senior Notes (b) 399.9 399.9 Purchase commitments (c) 120.5 120.5 Other contractual obligations (d) 27.9 27.9 Total $ 730.5 $ 189.2 $ 460.8 $ 47.0 $ 33.5 (a) We occupy approximately 1.5 million square feet world wide under operating leases. The majority of our office space is in North America, including our corporate headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. Our longest lease expires in May 2016. (b) Our principal commitment as of December 31, 2006 was our outstanding Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2008 (Senior Notes). The Senior Notes were issued in June 2003 and are senior unsecured obligations, rank on parity in right of 53 Table of Contents payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured debt, and rank senior to all of our existing and future debt that expressly provides that it is subordinated to the notes. The Senior Notes bear no interest, but are convertible into shares of our common stock, subject to certain conditions, at any time prior to maturity or their prior repurchase by Juniper Networks. The conversion rate is 49.6512 shares per each $1,000 principal amount of convertible notes, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The carrying value of the Senior Notes as of December 31, 2006 was $399.9 million. (c) We do not have firm purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers. In order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply, the contract manufacturers place non cancelable, non returnable (NCNR) orders, which were valued at $120.5 million as of December 31, 2006, based on our build forecasts. We do not take ownership of the components and the NCNR orders do not represent firm purchase commitments pursuant to our agreements with the contract manufacturers. The components are used by the contract manufacturers to build products based on purchase orders we have received from our customers. We do not incur a liability for products built by the contract manufacturer until it fulfills our customers order and the order ships. However, if the components go unused, we may be assessed carrying charges or obsolete charges. As of December 31, 2006, we had accrued $22.4 million based on our estimate of such charges. (d) Other Contractual obligations consist of the following: Escrow amount of $12.8 million related to the Funk acquisition to secure certain indemnity obligations. One half of the escrow expired in January 2007 and the remaining one half will expire in June 2007. Also included is a contingent bonus payable, based on certain milestones, of $5.0 million, which was earned over a one year period ending in 2006. Escrow amount of $1.6 million related to the Acorn acquisition to secure certain indemnity obligations. The escrow period will expire in May 2007. Also included is a contingent earn out payable to former Acorn stockholders, based on certain milestones, of up to $2.2 million, and a contingent bonus payable to employees related to continued employment of up to $0.5 million. The earn out and bonus amounts will be paid, to the extent earned, in 2007 and 2008. Escrow amount related to the Redline and Kagoor acquisitions of $0.7 million and $5.1 million, respectively, to secure certain indemnity obligations. There was 0.8 million shares of the Companys common stock with a fair value of $17.6 million, established as of the acquisition date, were held in escrow to secure certain indemnity obligations for the Peribit acquisition. Almost all of the escrow shares were distributed in February 2007 at the then current market value of $19.15 per share, or an aggregate fair value of $14.1 million. Summary of Cash Flows Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $755.6 million, $642.9 million and $439.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The cash provided by operating activities for each period was due to our net income (loss) adjusted by: Non cash charges of $1,536.4 million, $307.4 million, and $254.0 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, primarily related to depreciation and amortization expenses, stock based compensation, tax benefit of employee stock option plans, in process research and development from acquisitions, debt issuance costs, loss on disposal of property and equipment, restructuring expense, and impairment charges. Non cash charges in 2006 included a $1,283.4 million impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. In 2005 and 2004, non cash charges included $128.1 million and $62.6 million of tax benefit from employee stock options while tax benefit from employee stock options which in accordance with SFAS 123R are no longer included in cash flows from operations beginning in 2006 but rather are included in financing activities. In 2006, tax benefits from tax deductions in excess of the stock based compensation expense recognized was presented as a financing activity in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of 2006. Non cash charges in 2005 also included a benefit from the reversal of NetScreens acquisition related liabilities and a loss due to the impairment of an equity investment, partially offset by gains associated with available for sale investments. In 2004, non cash charges also included a loss from the redemption of the 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes and a loss due to the write down of equity investments. Net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $220.6 million, $(15.1) million, and $57.2 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, were in the normal course of business. These changes are highlighted as follows: 54 Table of Contents Net cash increases in 2006 are primarily attributable to increases in deferred revenue of $132.8 million due to the growing installed base and customer payments in advance of product acceptance. The increase in operating cash flows was also due to the decreases in accounts receivable of $20.7 million and aggregate decreases in prepaid expenses, other current assets and other long term assets of $23.0 million. Accounts payable increased $13.6 million and accrued compensation increased $12.7 million primarily due to the costs of headcount increases and related employee bonuses. Changes in taxes payable and other accrued liabilities contributed $18.3 million to cash flows from operations in 2006. Net cash used during the year ended December 31, 2005 from changes in account balances was primarily attributable to increases in net accounts receivable of $68.1 million and decreases in other accrued liabilities of $100.7 million and accrued warranty of $3.7 million. Decreases in the prepaid expenses, other current assets and other long term assets accounts of $5.3 million, the increases in income taxes payable of $26.6 million, deferred revenue of $64.3 million, accounts payable of $50.3 million and accrued compensation of $10.9 million contributed positively to cash flows from operations. Net cash provided during the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily attributable to increases in deferred revenue of $93.6 million due to increases in the Companys installed base. Increases in accrued compensation of $40.3 million, accounts payable of $29.4 million, income taxes payable of $16.9 million, other accrued liabilities of $11.0 million and accrued warranty of $3.6 million contributed to operating cash flows. These amounts were partially offset by increases in net accounts receivable of $81.4 million and prepaid expenses, other current assets, and other long term assets of $56.3 million. Investing Activities Net cash provided in investing activities was $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Net cash used in investing activities was $583.7 million and $58.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Investing activities included capital expenditures and the purchases and sale or maturities of available for sale securities, the purchase and sale of equity investments, and the acquisitions of businesses. Capital expenditures increased $3.9 million to $102.1 million in 2006 and increased $35.0 million to $98.2 million in 2005 mainly due to new product developments and overseas expansions, and business acquisitions. Positive net cash flows of $115.9 million generated from the sales and purchases of available for sale securities in 2006 was primarily due to higher short term interest rates. Purchases and sales of available for sale securities used $131.0 million and $34.7 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Other investing activities include: $15.1 million of cash was used in the acquisitions during 2005, $20.5 million of cash was provided by the decrease of restricted cash, and $7.3 million of minority equity investment during 2006; $15.1 million of cash used in acquisition was due to the escrow payments related to the 2005 acquisitions. Restricted cash decreased by $20.5 million in 2006 primarily due to the $15.1 million escrow payments associated with the 2005 acquisitions. Another contributing factor to the decrease in restricted cash in 2006 was the reduction in deposit requirements of $5.9 million pertaining to letters of credit for facility leases; $309.9 million of cash used in the 2005 acquisitions, $34.8 million of restricted cash funded to escrow accounts in relation to the 2005 acquisitions, and $9.8 million of minority equity investment during 2005; and $40.9 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired in connection with the NetScreen acquisition during 2004. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $89.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Net cash provided in financing activities was $146.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Net cash used in financing activities was $33.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Cash was provided during all periods from the issuance of common stock related to employee option exercises and stock purchase plans. In 2006, we repurchased 10,071,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $18.51 per share, or a total of $186.4 million. Common stock issued in relation to employee stock option exercises and Employee Stock Purchase Plan generated total cash proceeds of $87.1 million during the 2006 period. Beginning in 2006, SFAS 123R requires excess tax benefits relating to exercises of employee options to be included in financing activities. In 2006, total tax benefits of $9.7 million from tax deductions in excess of the expense recognized for employee stock options was presented as financing cash flows due to the adoption of SFAS 123R beginning on January 1, 2006. Tax deductions in excess of the expense recognized for employee stock options were previously included in operating cash flows prior to 2006. In 2005, common stock issued in relation to employee option exercises and Employee Stock Purchase Plan generated total cash proceeds of $146.0 million. In 2004, common stock issued in 55 Table of Contents relation to employee option exercises and Employee Stock Purchase Plan generated total cash proceeds of $175.2 million. During 2004, we spent $145.0 million to retire our Subordinated Notes and $63.6 million to retire 2.9 million shares of our common stock. The repurchase of our common stock did not have a material impact on our liquidity. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, (FIN 48). FIN 48 applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to FASB Statement 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, including uncertain tax positions. Under FIN 48 a company will recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. FIN 48 clarifies how a company would measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized, provides guidance as to the timing of the de recognition of previously recognized tax benefits and describes the methods for classifying and disclosing the liabilities within the financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits. FIN 48 also addresses when a company should record interest and penalties related to tax positions and how the interest and penalties may be classified within the income statement and presented in the balance sheet. Differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to and after the adoption of FIN 48 would be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings. We are required to adopt FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007. Upon adoption, there is a possibility that the cumulative effect would result in an adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings. In addition, the application of FIN 48 may increase our future effective tax rates and its future intra period effective tax rate volatility. We are currently evaluating the effect of the adoption of FIN 48 on our consolidated financial statements and are not yet in a position to determine such effects. In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurement, (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. The guidance clarifies the principle for assessing fair value based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. In support of this principle, the guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data such as companies own data. Under this guidance, fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating SFAS 157 and expect to adopt this guidance beginning on January 1, 2008. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types and maturities. These securities are generally classified as available for sale and, consequently, are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings of our investment portfolio. We do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures. The following table presents hypothetical changes in fair value of the financial instruments held at December 31, 2006 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates (in millions): Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Rate Decrease of X Basis Points (BPS) Fair Value as of Rate Increase of X BPS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) December 31, 2006 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS Government treasury and agencies $ 297.5 $ 296.0 $ 294.5 $ 293.0 $ 291.6 $ 290.1 $ 288.6 Corporate bonds and notes 520.4 517.7 515.0 512.3 509.6 506.8 504.1 Asset backed securities and other 333.9 333.4 332.9 332.4 331.9 331.4 331.0 Total $ 1,151.8 $ 1,147.1 $ 1,142.4 $ 1,137.7 $ 1,133.1 $ 1,128.3 $ 1,123.7 56 Table of Contents The following table presents hypothetical changes in fair value of the financial instruments held at December 31, 2005 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates (in millions): Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Rate Decrease of X Basis Points (BPS) Fair Value as of Rate Increase of X BPS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) December 31, 2005 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS Government treasury and agencies $ 304.7 $ 302.9 $ 301.1 $ 299.3 $ 297.6 $ 295.8 $ 294.0 Corporate bonds and notes 646.4 643.2 640.2 637.1 633.9 630.8 627.7 Asset backed securities and other 372.8 372.2 371.5 370.9 370.2 369.6 368.9 Total $ 1,323.9 $ 1,318.3 $ 1,312.8 $ 1,307.3 $ 1,301.7 $ 1,296.2 $ 1,290.6 These instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading. The modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (BPS), 100 BPS and 150 BPS, which are representative of the historical movements in the Federal Funds Rate. Foreign Currency Risk and Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts It is our policy to use derivatives to partially offset our market exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate transaction gains and losses generated by certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. These derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other income (expense). Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are largely offset by re measurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. These foreign exchange contracts have maturities between one and two months. Periodically, we use foreign currency forward and or option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to operating expenses. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of less than one year. The effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, and upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction, is subsequently reclassified into the consolidated statements of operations line item to which the hedged transaction relates. We record any ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments, which was immaterial during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, in other income (expense) in our results of operations. 57 Table of Contents
