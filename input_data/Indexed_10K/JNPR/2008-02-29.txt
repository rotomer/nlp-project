Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This Annual Report on Form 10 K (Report), including the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward looking statements regarding future events and the future results of our Company that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the industry in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management. Words such as expects, anticipates, targets, goals, projects, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. These forward looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this Report under the section entitled Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I and elsewhere, and in other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), specifically the most recent reports on Form 10 Q. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason. The following discussion is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingencies. In the course of operating our business, we routinely make decisions as to the timing of the payment of invoices, the collection of receivables, the manufacturing and shipment of products, the fulfillment of orders, the purchase of supplies, and the building of inventory and spare parts, among other matters. Each of these decisions has some impact on the financial results for any given period. In making these decisions, we consider various factors including contractual obligations, customer satisfaction, competition, internal and external financial targets and expectations, and financial planning objectives. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to sales returns, pricing credits, warranty costs, allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long term assets, especially goodwill and intangible assets, contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges, assumptions used in the valuation of stock based compensation, and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. To aid in understanding our operating results for the periods covered by this report, we have provided an executive overview and a summary of the significant events that affected the most recent fiscal year and a discussion of the nature of our operating expenses. These sections should be read in conjunction with the more detailed discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in this Item 7, our Risk Factors section included in Item 1A of Part I, and our audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in Item 8 of Part II of this report. 31 Table of Contents Executive Overview Our 2007 performance was the result of a combination of strong market demand for networking and security products as well as our focused execution and market share gains. In addition, we began shipment of several new products which contributed to our revenue growth during the year. During 2007, we also implemented a series of operational excellence initiatives. These initiatives are intended to strengthen the management systems and processes throughout our organization to support our growth. Total Reportable Segments (In millions, except percentages) Consolidated Infrastructure SLT Service Net revenues $ 2,836.1 $ 1,753.2 $ 573.8 $ 509.1 Year over year net revenues increase 23 % 24 % 20 % 24 % Management operating income (loss) $ 603.6 $ 495.5 $ (18.3 ) $ 126.4 Year over year management operating income increase (decrease) 18 % 18 % (62 )% 25 % Operating income $ 407.1 Year over year operating income increase 141 % Net income $ 360.8 Year over year net income increase N/M Net income per share: Basic $ 0.67 Diluted $ 0.62 N/M Not meaningful. Net Revenues: Net revenue increased $532.5 million, or 23%, to $2,836.1 million in 2007, compared to 2006. We experienced growth in both product and service revenues, which represented 82.0% and 18.0% of our total net revenue in 2007. Product revenue increased $433.7 million, or 23%, to $2,327.0 million in 2007, compared to the year ago period. Service revenue increased $98.8 million, or 24%, to $509.1 million in 2007, compared to 2006. Infrastructure product, SLT product and Service revenues represented 61.8%, 20.2% and 18.0% of our total net revenues, respectively, for 2007. Our revenue performance and share gains were driven by Infrastructure product and SLT product sales. Infrastructure product revenue increased $339.8 million, or 24%, in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily attributable to revenue growth in our M and T series routers, as well as our recently introduced MX series routers. SLT product revenue increased in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily attributable to the increased sales of our firewall virtual private network (Firewall) products, including our recently introduced SSG320M and SSG350M firewall appliances, and to a lesser extent, increases in secure socket layer virtual private network (SSL), J series, and WAN Optimization products. Service revenue increased in 2007 over the prior year primarily due to the increase in our installed base of equipment under service contracts and, to a lesser extent, growth in professional service revenue. New Infrastructure products shipped in 2007 include the T1600 router and our MX series product family. Our T1600 product is a high capacity and energy efficient core router. Our MX series family of Ethernet Service Routers enables service providers to deliver advance services including IPTV and video on demand at scale. The MX series includes MX960, a large capacity and high density Carrier Ethernet platform, and MX480, which began shipping in the fourth quarter of 2007. New SLT products introduced in 2007 include the SSG320M and SSG350M products, which are purpose built appliances that deliver high performance and secure connectivity for regional and branch office. We also introduced new products within the J series service router family, such as J2320 and J2350, which are designed to enable enterprises to accelerate the secure delivery of business critical applications across their networks. Additionally, we continued to make enhancements and design updates to other SLT product families during 2007. 32 Table of Contents From a geographical perspective, net revenues grew across the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia Pacific (APAC) regions. Operating Margin: Operating income increased $1,404.9 million to $407.1 million in 2007, compared to an operating loss of $997.8 million in 2006. Operating margin was 14.4% in 2007 as compared to 43.3% in 2006. The increase in operating margin was primarily attributable to decreases in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. Such decreases were largely due to the goodwill and intangible impairment charges of $1,283.4 million in 2006 and the absence of such charges in 2007. Additionally, to a lesser extent, operating margin improved due to the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue as well as decreases in other charges associated with our internal stock option investigation, partially offset by increases in research and development expenses in 2007 as compared to 2006. Net Income and Net Income Per Share: Net income was $360.8 million, or $0.62 per share on a diluted basis, in 2007, compared to a net loss of $1,001.4 million, or $1.76 per share on a diluted basis, in 2006. The increases in 2007 were primarily attributable to the goodwill and intangible impairment charges of $1,283.4 million in 2006 that were absent in 2007 as well as the revenue growth and an increase in operating margin as discussed above. Other Financial Highlights: We used $1,623.2 million to repurchase 69.4 million shares of our common stock in 2007. Cash used in our stock repurchases was offset by cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and common stock issued to our employees in connection with our equity incentive plans of $786.5 million, $571.8 million, and $355.0 million, respectively, in 2007. Significant Events Business and Market Environment In 2007, we benefited from the continued progress by our service provider customers in the build out of Next Generation Networks (NGN) designed to support a fast and cost effective deployment of multiple types of services (multi play services), such as voice, data, and video, that enable our customers to develop new sources of revenue and profitability. We maintained a strong position in the Infrastructure product business and gained share in key market segments. We also experienced an increased interest in our SLT portfolio due to increased network demand from our enterprise customers as well as growth from service providers using our SLT products for both managed service offerings and outsourced solutions for their customers. Additionally, we continued our momentum in the enterprise market for our SLT products as well as routing products portfolio. We now serve over 95 of the Fortune 100 companies and more than 30,000 enterprise customers worldwide. In addition, over 45 out of the 50 state governments in the United States have deployed our technologies. We believe our innovation and market momentum have enabled us to maintain relationships with our partners, including strategic resellers Alcatel Lucent, Ericsson, Inc., and Nokia Siemens Networks B.V. (NSN), while developing broader relationships with technology leaders such as International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) and Microsoft Corporation to better serve our customers. Stock Repurchase Activity We repurchased and retired 69.4 million common shares, at an average price of $23.37 per share for a total of $1,623.2 million as part of our $2.0 billion common stock repurchase program approved by our Board in July 2006 and February 2007 (the 2006 Stock Repurchase Program). As of December 31, 2007, our 2006 Stock Repurchase Program had a remaining authorization of $376.8 million for repurchases. See Note 15 in Item 8 for discussion of our stock repurchase activity in 2008. Stock Option Investigation and Amendment of Certain Stock Options In 2007, we completed the restatement of our historical financial statements as a result of our independent stock option investigation and review of historical stock compensation practices. In addition, we regained compliance with listing standards of the NASDAQ Global Select Market. We recorded $6.0 million in operating 33 Table of Contents expenses during 2007 in connection with this stock option investigation, compared to $20.5 million and nil in 2006 and 2005, respectively. In April 2007, we completed a tender offer to amend certain options granted under the Juniper Networks, Inc. Amended Restated 1996 Stock Plan and the Juniper Networks, Inc. 2000 Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan that had original exercise prices per share that were less than the fair market value per share of the common stock underlying the option on the options grant date, as determined by us for financial accounting purposes. Under this tender offer, employees subject to taxation in the United States and Canada had the opportunity to increase their strike price on affected options to the appropriate fair market value per share on the date of grant so as to avoid unfavorable tax consequences under United States Internal Revenue Code Section 409A (409A issue) or Canadian tax laws and regulations. In exchange for increasing the strike price of these options, we committed to make a cash payment to employees participating in the offer so as to make these employees whole for the incremental strike price as compared to their original option exercise price. In connection with the offer, we amended options to purchase 4.3 million shares of our common stock in 2007 and made aggregate cash payments of $7.6 million to offer participants in January 2008. We accrued this aggregate payment liability and recognized an operating expense for the corresponding amount during 2007. Settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission On August 28, 2007, we announced that the Commissioners of the SEC authorized the settlement between us and the SEC regarding the previously disclosed SEC inquiry into our historical stock option granting practices. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SECs complaint, we agreed to settle the charges by consenting to a permanent injunction against any future violations of the antifraud, reporting, books and records and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws. No monetary penalties were assessed against us in conjunction with this settlement. This settlement concludes the SECs formal investigation of the company with respect to our historical stock option granting practices. Adoption of FIN 48 We adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, (FIN 48) on January 1, 2007, the first day of fiscal 2007. Under FIN 48, an entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold. The cumulative effect of applying FIN 48 was a $19.2 million increase to the opening balance of accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2007 and a $1.0 million increase to goodwill. As of the date of adoption, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $85.2 million, of which $70.8 million, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. In accordance with our accounting policy, we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations. This policy did not change as a result of the adoption of FIN 48. We accrued interest expense and penalties of $4.1 million within other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of the date of adoption. We conduct business globally and, as a result, we or one or more of our subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as Ireland, Hong Kong, U.K., France, Germany, The Netherlands, Japan, China, Australia, and the U.S. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non U.S. income tax examinations for years before 2003, although carryforward attributes that were generated prior to 2003 may still be adjusted upon examination by the IRS if the attributes either have been or will be used in a future period. 34 Table of Contents Nature of Expenses Most of our manufacturing, repair and supply chain operations are outsourced to independent contract manufacturers. Accordingly, most of our cost of revenues consists of payments to our independent contract manufacturers for the standard product costs. The independent contract manufacturers produce our products using design specifications, quality assurance programs and standards that we establish. Controls around manufacturing, engineering and documentation are conducted at our facilities in Sunnyvale, California and Westford, Massachusetts. Our independent contract manufacturers have facilities primarily in Canada, China, Malaysia, and the United States. We generally do not own the components and title to products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon shipment. The contract manufacturers procure components based on our build forecasts and if actual component usage is lower than our forecasts, we may be, and have been in the past, liable for carrying or obsolete material charges. We have employees in our manufacturing and operations organization who manage relationships with our contract manufacturers, manage our supply chain, and monitor product testing and quality. Employee related costs have historically been the primary driver of our operating expenses and we expect this trend to continue. Employee related costs include items such as wages, commissions, bonuses, vacation, benefits, stock based compensation and travel. We had 5,879, 4,833, and 4,145 employees as of December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The year over year increases were primarily attributable to increases in our research and development, sales and customer service activities. Our headcount is expected to increase in 2008 as we continue to expand these functions. We accounted for stock based compensation under the fair value approach of FAS 123R in 2007 and 2006. In 2005, we accounted for stock based compensation under the intrinsic value approach of APB 25. Details of our stock based compensation expense are described in Note 1 and Note 9 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K. Facility and information technology departmental costs are allocated to other departments based on headcount. These departmental costs have increased in 2007 and 2006 due to increases in headcount and facility leases resulting from infrastructure systems added to support our growth and past acquisitions. Facility and information technology related headcount was 224, 177, and 168 as of December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. In 2008, we expect to further invest in our company wide information technology infrastructure as we implement our operational excellence initiatives. Our operating expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the British Pound, the Euro, Indian Rupee, and Japanese Yen. Changes in related currency exchange rates may affect our operating results. Periodically, we use foreign currency forward and or option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to operating expenses. The effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and, upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction, is subsequently reclassified into the consolidated statements of operations line item to which the hedged transaction relates. Any ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments is reported in other income (expense) on our consolidated statements of operations. The increase in operating expenses including research and development, sales and marketing, as well as general and administrative expenses, due to foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, was approximately 2% in 2007. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period. We regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from managements estimates. To the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future results of operations will be affected. 35 Table of Contents We believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition. Our products are integrated with software that is essential to the functionality of our equipment. Additionally, we provide unspecified upgrades and enhancements related to our integrated software through our maintenance contracts for most of our products. Accordingly, we account for revenue in accordance with Statement of Position No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, and all related interpretations. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery or performance has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Evidence of an arrangement generally consists of customer purchase orders and, in certain instances, sales contracts or agreements. Shipping terms and related documents, or written evidence of customer acceptance, when applicable, are used to verify delivery or performance. In instances where we have outstanding obligations related to product delivery or the final acceptance of the product, revenue is deferred until all the delivery and acceptance criteria have been met. We assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and the customers payment history to us. Accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts, estimated customer returns and pricing credits. For arrangements with multiple elements, such as sales of products that include services, we allocate revenue to each element using the residual method based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered items. Under the residual method, the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements. Vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately. We then recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with our policies for product and service revenue recognition. If vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of one or more undelivered items does not exist, revenue is deferred and recognized at the earlier of (i) delivery of those elements or (ii) when fair value can be established unless maintenance is the only undelivered element, in which case, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the contractual support period. Our ability to recognize revenue in the future may be affected if actual selling prices are significantly less than fair value. In addition, our ability to recognize revenue in the future could be impacted by conditions imposed by our customers. For sales to direct end users and value added resellers, we recognize product revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss, which is generally upon shipment. It is our practice to identify an end user prior to shipment to a value added reseller. For our end users and value added resellers, there are no significant obligations for future performance such as rights of return or pricing credits. A portion of our sales are made through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits and or rights of return. We recognize product revenue on sales made through these distributors upon sell through as reported to us by the distributors. Deferred revenue on shipments to distributors reflects the effects of distributor pricing credits and the amount of gross margin expected to be realized upon sell through. Deferred revenue is recorded net of the related product costs of revenue. We record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments, such as rebates and price protection, in the same period that the related revenue is recorded. The amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns and price protection credits, specific criteria included in rebate agreements, and other factors known at the time. Additional reductions to revenue would result if actual product returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates. In addition, we report revenue net of sales taxes. Services include maintenance, training and professional services. Maintenance is offered under renewable contracts. Revenue from maintenance service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the contractual support period, which is generally one to three years. Revenue from training and professional services is recognized as the services are completed or ratably over the contractual period, which is generally one year or less. We sell certain interests in accounts receivables as part of a distributor accounts receivable financing arrangement which was established by us with a major financing company. Accounts receivables sold under 36 Table of Contents this arrangement in advance of revenue recognition are accounted for as debt and were $10.0 million and nil as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Contract Manufacturer Liabilities. We outsource most of our manufacturing, repair and supply chain management operations to our independent contract manufacturers and a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of payments to them. Our independent contract manufacturers procure components and manufacture our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts are based on our estimates of future demand for our products, which are in turn based on historical trends and an analysis from our sales and marketing organizations, adjusted for overall market conditions. We establish reserves for carrying charges and obsolete material charges for excess components purchased based on historical trends. If the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecasted, which may be caused by factors outside of our control, we have contractual liabilities and exposures with the independent contract manufacturers, such as carrying costs and obsolete material exposures, which would have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability. Warranty Reserve. We generally offer a one year warranty on all of our hardware products and a 90 day warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the products. We establish reserves for estimated product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized. Although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, use of materials and technical labor costs and associated overhead incurred in correcting any product failure. Should actual product failure rates, use of materials or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, additional warranty reserves could be required, which could reduce gross margins. Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets. Goodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. The amounts and useful lives assigned to other intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization, and the amount assigned to in process research and development is expensed immediately. The value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, could be impacted by future adverse changes such as: (i) future declines in our operating results, (ii) a decline in the valuation of technology company stocks, including the valuation of our common stock, (iii) significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or the networking industry or (iv) failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results. We evaluate these assets on an annual basis as of November 1 or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. In the process of our annual impairment review, we use the market approach as well as the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method to determine the fair value of our intangible assets. Significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation. The estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business. It is possible, however, that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect. If our actual results, or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses, are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets, we could incur additional impairment charges. Stock Based Compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with FAS No. 123R beginning in 2006. Under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (FAS 123R), stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the awards fair value as calculated by the Black Scholes Merton (BSM) option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period. The BSM model requires various highly subjective assumptions including volatility, forfeiture rates, and expected option life. If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly, stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. In conjunction with the adoption of FAS 123R, we also adopted the single approach method for valuing our stock based awards as well as the straight line method for amortizing the related stock based compensation expense under the modified prospective approach. Prior to the adoption of FAS 123R, we accounted for stock based compensation under the intrinsic value recognition provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25). 37 Table of Contents Income Taxes. Estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences and carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income based on the realization criteria set forth under FAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe to be more likely than not realizable. We believe it is more likely than not that forecasted income together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Similarly, if we subsequently realize deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation allowance would be reversed, resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings or a decrease in goodwill in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities may result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimate of tax liabilities is less than the amount ultimately assessed, a further charge to expense would result. On January 1, 2007, we adopted FIN 48. FIN 48 is an interpretation of FASB Statement 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and it seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on de recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosures and transition. Under FIN 48, an entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold. In addition, the application of FIN 48 may increase an entitys future effective tax rates and its future intra period effective tax rate volatility. Our cumulative effect of applying FIN 48 was a $19.2 million increase to the opening balance of accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2007 and a $1.0 million increase to goodwill. Loss Contingencies. We are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required. In addition, from time to time, we are involved in disputes, litigation and other legal actions. We are aggressively defending our current litigation matters; however, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and these actions or other third party claims against us may cause us to incur costly litigation and or substantial settlement charges. In addition, the resolution of any future intellectual property litigation may require us to make royalty payments, which could adversely impact gross margins in future periods. If any of those events were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We record a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the range of loss can be reasonably estimated. However, the actual liability in any such litigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to record additional expenses. 38 Table of Contents Results of Operations Net Revenues The following table shows total net product and service revenues and net product and service revenues as a percentage of total net revenues (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 $ Change % Change 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Net revenues: Product $ 2,327.0 $ 1,893.3 $ 433.7 23 % $ 1,893.3 $ 1,771.0 $ 122.3 7 % Percentage of net revenues 82.0 % 82.2 % 82.2 % 85.8 % Service 509.1 410.3 98.8 24 % 410.3 293.0 117.3 40 % Percentage of net revenues 18.0 % 17.8 % 17.8 % 14.2 % Total net revenues $ 2,836.1 $ 2,303.6 $ 532.5 23 % $ 2,303.6 $ 2,064.0 $ 239.6 12 % Our total net revenues increased $532.5 million, or 23% to $2,836.1 million in 2007 as compared to 2006. Our total net revenues increased $239.6 million, or 12% to $2,303.6 million in 2006 as compared to 2005. The increases in both years were primarily due to the demand growth in the markets we serve. In addition, we gained market share in several areas and capitalized on the opportunities in our targeted markets with our new and existing product and service offerings during 2007. Net Product Revenues Our net product revenue increased $433.7 million, or 23%, from 2006 to $2,327.0 million in 2007. The increase was the result of increased activity in both Infrastructure product and SLT product sales to service provider and enterprise markets. In particular we had success in selling our products to customers who are adopting NGN IP networks, which are designed to reduce total operating costs and to be able to offer multiple services over a single network. In addition, we had a number of new product releases and expanded into new emerging markets during 2007. Net product revenue grew $122.3 million, or 7% from 2005 to 2006, the majority of which was generated from our SLT product revenue growth in 2006. The following table shows total net product revenues and net product revenues as a percentage of total net revenues by product category (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 $ Change % Change 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Net product revenues: Infrastructure $ 1,753.2 $ 1,413.4 $ 339.8 24 % $ 1,413.4 $ 1,371.6 $ 41.8 3 % Percentage of net revenues 61.8 % 61.4 % 61.4 % 66.5 % SLT 573.8 479.9 93.9 20 % 479.9 399.4 80.5 20 % Percentage of net revenues 20.2 % 20.8 % 20.8 % 19.3 % Total net product revenues $ 2,327.0 $ 1,893.3 $ 433.7 23 % $ 1,893.3 $ 1,771.0 $ 122.3 7 % Infrastructure Product Revenues Infrastructure product revenues accounted for $1,753.2 million, or 61.8%, of total net revenues, and increased $339.8 million, or 24%, in 2007, compared to 2006. We benefited from the strong worldwide demand for high performance router products as our service provider customers seek simplified, scalable network infrastructures across fiber, cable and mobile access technologies to support increasing performance demands on their networks. The Infrastructure product revenue increase in 2007 was primarily attributable to increased revenue from our M , T , and 39 Table of Contents MX series router products driven by our service provider customers continued build out of NGN as their bandwidth requirement increases. Our service provider customers also moved towards NGNs designed to enable a fast and cost effective deployment of differentiating multi play services that allow them to generate new sources of revenue. Also contributing to the revenue growth was an increase in Infrastructure product sales to the content service provider and the enterprise markets. From a geographical perspective, we experienced strength in the Americas region. We also experienced revenue increases in APAC and EMEA. Infrastructure products accounted for $1,413.4 million, or 61.4%, of our total net revenues during 2006 and $1,371.6 million, or 66.5%, of our total net revenues during 2005. Infrastructure product net revenue grew by $41.8 million, or 3%, from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to continued success from a very significant year of growth in 2005, which strengthened our position as a supplier to the largest service providers in the world, particularly in the Americas and in EMEA. We experienced revenue growth in higher end infrastructure chassis products and increased penetration by our core and edge router portfolio as service providers acquired products for their NGNs and multi play service offerings. This growth was partially offset by a pause in the build out of NGNs and associated purchase decisions, particularly in Japan, as major carriers prepare for the next stage of bandwidth and services expansion, and a large product revenue deferral as of December 31, 2006 for products shipped to one of our largest customers. We track Infrastructure chassis revenue units recognized and ports shipped to analyze customer trends and indicate areas of potential network growth. Our Infrastructure product platforms are essentially modular, with the chassis serving as the base of the platform. Each chassis has a certain number of slots that are available to be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces. The modules are the components through which the router receives incoming packets of data from a variety of transmission media. The physical connection between a transmission medium and a module is referred to as a port. The number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the functionality and throughput offered by the module. Chassis revenue units represent the number of chassis on which revenue was recognized during the period. The following table shows infrastructure revenue units recognized and ports shipped: Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Unit Change % Change 2006 2005 Unit Change % Change Infrastructure chassis revenue units 11,195 10,211 984 10 % 10,211 9,977 234 2 % Infrastructure ports shipped 225,452 160,318 65,134 41 % 160,318 153,763 6,555 4 % Chassis revenue units increased 10% from 2006 to 2007 as our customers expanded the capacity in their existing networks. The increase was mainly due to the introduction of the MX series products, which are our Carrier Ethernet base routers. We also experienced growth in our M and T series products, driven by bandwidth demand as service provider customers sought to expand voice and video capability in their existing networks. Port shipment units increased by 41% in 2007 as compared to 2006. The increase was associated with the growth in chassis revenue units with larger expansion capacity and the customers need to differentiate themselves by providing feature rich multi play services. Chassis revenue units slightly increased from 2005 to 2006 due primarily to the sales of higher end T series and M series products and the inclusion of the chassis units related to a 2005 acquisition, partially offset by decreases in sales of lower end E series and M series products. Sales of higher end chassis units increased as our customers continued to adopt and expand IP networks in order to reduce total operating costs and to be able to offer multiple services over a single network. Port shipment units increased from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to the increase in port demands driven by the larger expansion capacity in the higher end chassis revenue units shipped during 2006, partially offset by the lower port capacity in the CTP series chassis revenue units. SLT Product Revenues SLT product revenues accounted for 20.2% of total net revenues and increased $93.9 million, or 20%, to $573.8 million in 2007, compared to 2006. The revenue increase was due to sales increases across the majority of the SLT product families particularly the Firewall, SSL, WAN Optimization and J series products. Our customers 40 Table of Contents demands for SLT products grew due to their increasing focus on addressing the risks associated with connecting and delivering critical network services and business applications. The integrated systems introduced prior to 2007, such as the ISG and SSG firewall products, gained traction in the market place and generated additional revenue in 2007. The revenue increase from our SSL products was due to our deployments of SSL solutions to enterprises and governments who were seeking to enhance their remote access to data and applications. We experienced considerable improvement in revenue from our WAN Optimization application acceleration platforms as customers sought to boost the responsiveness of their networks. All three geographic regions had significant growth in SLT sales during 2007. We experienced a growing demand for our SLT products in both the enterprise and service provider markets as we focused on cross selling more integrated products and solutions in the enterprise and service provider markets while leveraging partnerships with open standards based interoperability of our SLT products. In addition, we benefited from typical fourth quarter seasonality. We generally experienced seasonality and fluctuations in the demand for our SLT products, which may result in greater variations in our quarterly revenue. In January 2008, we announced a plan to phase out our DX product line. These products will be supported until 2013. We do not expect this plan to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. SLT products accounted for $479.9 million, or 20.8%, of our total net revenues in 2006 and $399.4 million, or 19.3%, of total net revenues during 2005. SLT product net revenue increased $80.5 million, or 20%, from 2005 to 2006 due to a growing demand and brand recognition for our SLT products from large enterprises and the U.S. Federal Government. Sales increased across various SLT product families including Firewalls, IDP, J series, DX, and SSL. In addition, the new products announced in 2006 and the DX and application acceleration products added to our portfolio through the various acquisitions in 2005 contributed to this increase. In addition, we experienced success in cross selling SLT products to service providers for both their own IT infrastructure and resale built upon the acquisitions we completed in 2005. A further part of the increase was due to successfully selling to much larger enterprise customers with increased footprint and complexity. The following table shows SLT revenue units recognized: Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Unit Change % Change 2006 2005 Unit Change % Change Service Layer Technologies units 239,021 183,575 55,446 30 % 183,575 170,181 13,394 8 % SLT product units increased in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily attributable to the growing demand for our SLT products in the market place. The 30% increase in the number of SLT units was greater than the revenue increase of 20% primarily due to the increased revenue from sales of our branch firewall products, which have lower average selling price than other SLT products. SLT product units increased 8% while SLT product revenue increased 20% in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to sales of high end firewalls. Net Service Revenues Net service revenues increased $98.8 million, or 24%, to $509.1 million in 2007, compared to 2006, and represent 18.0% of net revenues. The growth in service revenue was primarily driven by increased technical support service contracts associated with higher Infrastructure and SLT product sales, which have resulted in increased renewals and a larger installed base of equipment being serviced. Installed base is calculated by each customer based on the number of systems that the customers has under maintenance. A majority of our service revenue is earned from customers who purchase our products and enter into maintenance contracts that are generally for one year renewable periods. We also have multi year maintenance contracts. These contracts are typically for services such as 24 hour customer support, non specified updates and hardware repairs. We recognize revenue from service contracts as the services are completed or ratably over the period of the obligation. In addition to support services and professional services, we also provide educational services. Consistent with 2006, support service revenues represents 89% of net service revenues in 2007. To a lesser extent, professional services also contributed to the growth in net service revenues in 2007. Professional service revenue increased primarily due to large customer deployments requiring consulting services. 41 Table of Contents Net service revenues increased $117.3 million, or 40%, from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to the growth in support services driven by an increase in the installed base that we are servicing, as well as increased attach rates on new product sales, improved enterprise service infrastructure allowing more rapid implementation of services and the addition of new professional service offerings. Professional service revenue also increased, to a lesser extent, in 2006 compared to 2005 due primarily to maintenance related on site engineering services as well as additional consulting projects in 2006. Total Net Revenues by Geographic Region The following table shows total net revenues by geographic region (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006* $ Change % Change 2006* 2005* $ Change % Change Americas: United States $ 1,215.8 $ 950.3 $ 265.5 28 % $ 950.3 $ 879.0 $ 71.3 8 % Other 124.7 83.0 41.7 50 % 83.0 53.9 29.1 54 % Total Americas 1,340.5 1,033.3 307.2 30 % 1,033.3 932.9 100.4 11 % Percentage of net revenues 47.3 % 44.8 % 44.8 % 45.2 % Europe, Middle East and Africa 918.0 817.4 100.6 12 % 817.4 610.1 207.3 34 % Percentage of net revenue 32.4 % 35.5 % 35.5 % 29.6 % Asia Pacific 577.6 452.9 124.7 28 % 452.9 521.0 (68.1 ) 13 % Percentage of net revenues: 20.3 % 19.7 % 19.7 % 25.2 % Total $ 2,836.1 $ 2,303.6 $ 532.5 23 % $ 2,303.6 $ 2,064.0 $ 239.6 12 % * Prior year information has been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. We continue to experience varying distribution of revenue among our three geographic regions for the three years ended December 31, 2007 and we expect this trend to continue. Net revenues in the Americas region increased $307.2 million, or 30%, to $1,340.5 million in 2007 as compared to 2006. The Americas region represented 47.3% of net revenues in 2007, an increase of 2.5 percentage points over 2006. The increases were largely due to strength in the United States and in Latin America. Net revenue from the United States increased $265.5 million in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to revenue growth in the Infrastructure product segment from our service provider and internet content provider customers and, to a lesser extent, SLT product and Service segments. Net revenues from Latin America increased $39.1 million in 2007, compared to 2006, primarily due to strength in Brazil driven by sales to a major local carrier. Total 2006 revenue recorded by the Americas region grew by $100.4 million from its 2005 level and remained at approximately 45% of worldwide revenue, as compared to 2005, due to significant success in the United States and with the main service providers in Canada and various South American countries including Brazil and Argentina. Net revenue in the United States increased by $71.3 million in 2006 from 2005 due to continued success both with enterprise customers such as the U.S. Federal Government, as well as with major service providers in the United States. The increase was also due in part to sales to major internet content providers and cable providers. This success was partially offset by a significant product revenue deferral for products shipped to one of our largest customers. Net revenue in Americas as a percentage of total net revenue decreased slightly in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of the strong growth in EMEA. Net revenue in the EMEA region increased $100.6 million, or 12%, to $918.0 million in 2007, compared to 2006, due to increased Infrastructure product and SLT product revenues along with increased service revenue driven by strong bandwidth demands in the region. Revenue increased in Belgium, Ireland, United Kingdom, and France, 42 Table of Contents partially offset by a decrease in the Netherlands as well as revenue growth in the emerging markets such as Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Net revenue from EMEA as a percentage of net revenues decreased 3.1 percentage points to 32.4% in 2007 over 2006 primarily due to relative strength in the Americas region. Revenue in the EMEA region grew by $207.3 million, or 34%, in 2006, compared to 2005, due to significant success with NGN deployments across the region, in particular Sweden, the Netherlands, France, and Germany, as well as sales growth in emerging regions including Russia, Eastern Europe and the Middle East. As a result, net revenue from EMEA as a percentage of net revenues increased 5.9 percentage points to 35.5% in 2006 over 2005. Net revenue in the Asia Pacific region increased $124.7 million, or 28%, to $577.6 million in 2007, compared to 2006, due to increased revenue from Infrastructure products, SLT products and Service driven by demands from service providers as well as enterprise customers resulting from cross selling of our product portfolio. We experienced revenue growth across the region with strength in Korea, Australia, Malaysia, India and Indonesia. Revenue from the Asia Pacific region declined $68.1 million, or 13%, in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to the impact of certain NGN project decision delays in Japan driving revenue down year over year, partially offset by increased demands in China. NSN accounted for greater than 10% of our net product and service revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005. We expect that our largest customers, as well as key strategic partners, will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenues in 2008. Cost of Revenues The following table shows cost of product and service revenues and the related gross margin (GM) percentages (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 $ Change % Change 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Cost of revenues: Product $ 676.2 $ 555.1 $ 121.1 22 % $ 555.1 $ 506.3 $ 48.8 10 % GM percentage of revenue 70.9 % 70.7 % 70.7 % 71.4 % Service 251.4 199.2 52.2 26 % 199.2 147.2 52.0 35 % GM percentage of revenue 50.6 % 51.4 % 51.4 % 49.8 % Total cost of revenues $ 927.6 $ 754.3 $ 173.3 23 % $ 754.3 $ 653.5 $ 100.8 15 % GM percentage of revenue 67.3 % 67.3 % 67.3 % 68.3 % Cost of Product Revenues Product gross margin improved from 70.7% in 2006 to 70.9% in 2007. The slight increase in product gross margin was mainly due to favorable product mix and, to a lesser extent, improvements in standard costs of our Infrastructure products, partially offset by a slight decrease in our SLT product gross margin. The improvement of standard costs as a percentage of product revenue was primarily due to our increased purchases from contract manufacturers and suppliers in lower cost regions. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we employed 190 and 149 people, respectively, in our manufacturing and operations organization. These personnel manage relationships with our contract manufacturers, manage our supply chain, and monitor product testing and quality. Infrastructure product gross margin percentages improved slightly in 2007 compared to 2006. Our Infrastructure chassis revenue units increased 10% while our Infrastructure ports shipped increased 41% during 2007, on a year over year basis, compared to the Infrastructure product revenues increase of 24% for the year. We experienced a favorable product mix and derived a larger portion of revenues from richly configured high end M series and T series router products. We also generated revenues from high margin port shipments, which are add on components to the chassis routers. The increases in chassis units and port shipments were driven by bandwidth demand as customers are seeking to expand capabilities in their networks and to offer differentiating feature rich multi play services that allow them to generate new revenue sources. See further details in the Infrastructure Product Revenues section. 43 Table of Contents The gross margin improvement from Infrastructure products was offset by a slight decrease in our SLT product gross margin in 2007. The decrease in SLT product gross margin was primarily due to product mix, particularly from an increase in the mix of lower margin branch Firewall and J series products in 2007. In addition, higher manufacturing costs associated with newer and more complex products were also impacting SLT gross margin. The higher manufacturing costs were partially offset as we realized the benefit of our cost reduction efforts of moving more manufacturing to lower cost regions. See further details in the SLT Product Revenues section. Cost of product revenues increased $48.8 million, or 10%, in 2006 as compared to 2005. The increase was primarily attributable to increased product revenue in both the enterprise and service provider markets. Net product gross margin of 70.7% for 2006 slightly decreased, compared to 71.4% for 2005, primarily due to the impact of the mix of products and the mix of territories, partially offset by reduced manufacturing costs. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, we employed 149 and 134 people, respectively, in our manufacturing and operations organization. The increase in stock compensation expense in cost of product revenue from 2005 to 2006 of $0.9 million was primarily due to the impact of adopting FAS 123R on January 1, 2006. Product gross margins tend to fluctuate due to changes in the mix of products sold and our gross margins may be impacted as we introduce new products and manage production costs among multiple contract manufacturers or when our customers change the timing of their purchases. We will continue to seek reductions in our production costs as we enter into new markets, including markets with different pricing structures and cost structures. Our margins are impacted by changes in distribution channels and price competition as well as changes in the geographic mix of our sales. Sales discounts, warranty costs, changes in shipment volume, loss of cost savings due to changes in component pricing also impact gross margins. These factors, combined with how well we execute on our strategy and operating plans, may lead to margin variability. Cost of Service Revenues Cost of service revenues increased $52.2 million, or 26%, to $251.4 million in 2007 as compared to 2006. Service gross margin decreased by less than one percentage point to 50.6% in 2007 as compared to 2006. The increase in service costs and the decrease in gross margin were primarily attributable to increases in headcount related expenses associated with expanding our service delivery infrastructure and professional service organization, particularly in North America and in India, as well as increasing our resources for supporting network build outs and deployments by our customers. Service related headcount increased by 137 employees, or 22%, to 748 employees in 2007, compared to 611 in 2006. Employee salary and related expenses, including stock based compensation expense, represented the majority of the increases in cost of service revenues in 2007. Total employee salary and related expenses as a percentage of service revenues were approximately 25% for 2007 and 20% for 2006. Outside service expense increased as we used outside providers to support the increase in customer support contracts and professional engagements. Freight related expense increased due to the deployment of spare parts in supporting our growth overseas. Facility and IT expenses allocation to the cost of service revenues increased in 2007, which is consistent with other areas of our organization, due to our headcount growth and investment in internal infrastructure to support our growing business. Partially offsetting the increases was a decrease in spares expense due to the large spares purchase we made in 2006. Cost of service revenues increased $52.0 million, or 35%, to $199.2 million in 2006 as compared to 2005. The increase was a direct result of a larger installed base of products covered by service contracts. However, our service gross margin increased one percentage point from 2005 to 2006 as a result of improved efficiencies and economies of scale, which result in a better leveraged service organization. Total employee salary and related expenses as a percentage of service revenue were approximately 20% for 2006 and 20% for 2005; however, in absolute dollars, employee salary and related expenses increased from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to an investment in new customer service personnel, particularly to support our enterprise customers. Stock compensation expense in cost of service revenue also increased from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to the impact of adopting FAS 123R in 2006. In addition to personnel expenses, outside services costs increased from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to contracting for engineers to provide professional services revenue, particularly for the Middle East and other emerging markets. Spares and freight costs increased from 2005 to 2006 due to a significant investment in spares around the world to support the increase in customer contracts, particularly in the enterprise market. Finally, the costs associated with facilities, 44 Table of Contents depreciation and other expenses allocated to cost of service revenue increased from 2005 to 2006 due to increases in revenue and investment in infrastructure to support the growing business.

The following table highlights our operating expenses and operating income (loss) as a percentage of net revenues: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Research and development 22.0 % 20.8 % 17.3 % Sales and marketing 23.5 % 24.2 % 21.4 % General and administrative 4.1 % 4.2 % 3.6 % Amortization of purchased intangible assets 3.0 % 4.0 % 4.1 % Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 55.7 % 0.3 % In process research and development 0.6 % Other charges, net 0.3 % 1.7 % (0.3 )% Total operating expenses 52.9 % 110.6 % 47.0 % Operating income (loss) 14.4 % (43.3 )% 21.4 % Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses include: the costs of developing our products from components to prototypes to finished products, the costs for outside services such as certifications of new products, and expenditures associated with equipment used for testing. Several components of our research and development effort require significant expenditures, such as the development of new components and the purchase of prototype equipment, the timing of which can cause quarterly variability in our expenses. We expense our research and development costs as they are incurred. Research and development expense increased $142.7 million, or 30%, and increased 1.2 percentage points of net revenues in 2007 over 2006. The increase was largely due to our commitment to continue innovation of our 45 Table of Contents products. In particular in 2007, we continued the development of our Ethernet products, including the MX series and our new EX series Ethernet switching products introduced in January 2008, as well as the development of our new T1600 product, which was released in November 2007. Personnel related expenses, which comprise the majority of our research and development expenses, increased primarily due to headcount growth and merit based salary increases in 2007. Research and development related headcount increased by 493 employees, or 24%, in 2007 to 2,563 employees as of December 31, 2007. Headcount increase was primarily due to additional hires in the engineering organization within the Infrastructure segment. In addition to personnel related expenses, we also increased prototype and lab equipment expenses in 2007 for the development of our new products. Additionally our allocated facilities and information technology, as well as depreciation expenses, for our research and development organization increased in 2007 due to increases in headcount from additional internal systems to support our growth. In general, we grew our engineering organizations to support product innovation, expand and improve our product portfolio and address growth opportunities in NGN bandwidth and features for our service provider and enterprise customers. Research and development expenses increased $123.0 million, or 3.5 percentage points of net revenues, in 2006 over 2005 as a result of our focus on the development of a broader portfolio of networking products. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases in personnel related expenses, depreciation, facility related expenses, engineering and testing expenses, outside service expenses and equipment related expenses. The increases in personnel related expenses in 2006 were primarily due to additional hires in the engineering organization across the Infrastructure and SLT segments. Headcount increased 19% from 1,736 individuals to 2,070 individuals during 2006. The headcount increase was attributable to product innovation efforts in areas including router security and integration in order to capture potential future NGN infrastructure growth and other opportunities in the enterprise and the service provider markets. To a lesser extent, the increases in personnel expenses were attributable to merit based salary increases beginning in April 2006. Facility, engineering and testing expense increased in 2006 to support our product innovation efforts. Outside service expenses increased in 2006 primarily due to additional consulting projects on developing future product roadmaps. The increase in stock compensation expense in research and development expenses from 2005 to 2006 of $24.0 million was primarily due to the impact of adopting FAS 123R in 2006. Our investment and expansion on our global research and development efforts were primarily in China and India. We plan to increase our investment in research and development during 2008, compared to 2007, to further advance our competitive advantage. As a percentage of net revenues, we anticipate our research and development spending will decrease slightly in 2008. Sales and Marketing Expenses Sales and marketing expenses include costs for promoting our products and services, demonstration equipment and advertisements. These costs vary quarter to quarter depending on revenues, product launches and marketing initiatives. We have an extensive distribution channel in place that we use to target new customers and increase sales. We have made substantial investments in our distribution channel during 2007, 2006 and 2005. Sales and marketing expenses increased $108.7 million, or 19%, to $666.7 million and represented 23.5% of total net revenues in 2007, compared to 24.2% in 2006. As a percentage of net revenue, sales and marketing expenses decreased slightly in 2007 due to our focus on increasing our operating margin and the efficiency of our sales activities. The increases in absolute dollars were primarily headcount related increases. Sales and marketing related headcount increased 272 employees, or 17%, in 2007 to 1,863 as of December 31, 2007 as we hired additional personnel across our Infrastructure and SLT organizations to support the larger product portfolio and to expand our presence in the enterprise marketplace. In addition, commission expenses increased primarily as a result of strong revenue growth. In 2007, we also increased consulting expenses to support our sales and marketing initiatives. Likewise our need and expenses for demonstration equipment has grown as we seek to capture new markets and release new products. As the sales and marketing organization grows, we have also grown our information technology and facilities to these organizations, accounting for the increases of related expense allocations in 2007 over 2006. 46 Table of Contents Sales and marketing expenses increased $116.4 million, or 26%, to $558.0 million in 2006 compared to 2005 and increased as a percent of total net revenues. The increases were primarily due to increases in personnel related expenses, facility related expenses, travel expenses, marketing related activities, and equipment related expenses. Personnel related expenses increased in 2006 primarily due to additional hires to support the expansion of our distribution channels and customer base, as well as to support the larger portfolio of products. In particular, we expanded our enterprise sales force, and targeted key growth areas such as China, the Middle East and India. We added 171 individuals to our sales and marketing function during 2006. Travel expense increased in 2006 due primarily to increased headcount and more activity in emerging markets. Marketing related activities increased primarily as a result of specific activities designed to expand and improve our brand recognition, support of our distribution channels, introduction of new products, targeted solution value propositions and increase awareness of our existing products to a broader range of customers. Equipment related expenses increased in 2006 due to the introduction of new products. The increase in stock compensation expenses in sales and marketing from 2005 to 2006 of $24.5 million was primarily due to the impact of adopting FAS 123R in 2006. We plan to continue our investment in sales and marketing activities in both direct and channel sales as well as our service provider and enterprise focus. We anticipate our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars but decrease as a percentage of net revenues in 2008. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses include professional fees, bad debt provisions and other corporate expenses. Professional fees include legal, audit, tax, accounting and certain corporate strategic services. General and administrative expenses increased $19.3 million, or 20%, and represented 4.1% of total net revenues in 2007, compared to 4.2% in 2006. As a percentage of net revenue, general and administrative expenses slightly decreased in 2007 due to our focus on increasing our operating margin. The increases in absolute dollars were primarily due to increases in personnel related expenses and outside professional services. Employee related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, stock based compensation, and fringe benefits expenses, increased in 2007 over 2006, as headcount increased by 56 employees, or 24%, in 2007 to 291 employees as of December 31, 2007. The headcount increases were primarily in the finance and human resources organizations as we expanded our organization infrastructure in lower cost regions, improved internal processes and continued our initiatives to update our information systems. Outside services increased $4.5 million in 2007, compared to 2006, as we invested in designing a more efficient organizational structure and improving our internal systems. Such increases were offset by the decreases in accounting and legal fees of $1.5 million for 2007, compared to 2006. Consistent with other areas of our organization, facilities and information technology allocations increased in order to support these initiatives and the growth of our business. General and administrative expenses increased $22.1 million, or 29%, in 2006 compared to 2005. As a percentage of net revenues, general and administrative expenses increased slightly from 3.6% in 2005 to 4.2% in 2006. The increases were driven by increases in personnel related expenses and other related expenses. General and administrative world wide headcount increased 11%, or 24 individuals, during 2006, to support the overall growth in the business. Bad debt expense increased in 2006 primarily due to a bad debt expense benefit in 2005. Facility and IT related allocation expense increased as a result of our personnel growth and development of our systems infrastructure. The increase of general and administrative related stock compensation expense from 2005 to 2006 of $11.8 million was primarily due to the impact of adopting FAS 123R in 2006. We anticipate our general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars but decrease as a percentage of net revenues in 2008. Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets Amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased $5.9 million due to purchased intangible assets reaching the end of the amortization period during 2007 as compared to 2006. Amortization of purchased intangible assets increased $6.6 million in 2006, compared to 2005, as a result of recognizing a full year of amortization associated with the five acquisitions completed in 2005. See Note 3 in Item 8 for more information on our purchased intangible assets. 47 Table of Contents Impairment of Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets We had no impairment against our goodwill or intangible assets in 2007. Impairment charges increased by $1,277.5 million in 2006, compared to 2005, as a result of the impairment of both goodwill and purchased intangible assets during 2006. Due primarily to the decline in the Companys market capitalization that occurred over a period of approximately six months prior to the impairment review and, to a lesser extent, to a decrease in the forecasted future cash flows used in the income approach, we evaluated the carrying value of our goodwill and reduced the goodwill within the SLT segment by $1,280.0 million. In addition, we recorded a $3.4 million impairment expense pertaining to a write down of intangible assets as a result of a decrease in forecasted revenue for the SBC stand alone products during the second quarter of 2006. In 2005, we wrote down $5.9 million of purchased intangible assets acquired from Kagoor Networks, Inc. (Kagoor). See Note 3 in Item 8 for more information on our impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets. In Process Research and Development We had no in process research and development (IPRD) charges in 2007 and 2006. In 2005, a total of $11.0 million was charged to IPRD expense in connection with three of our five acquisitions during the year. Of the total Funk purchase price, $5.3 million was allocated to IPRD. Of the total Peribit purchase price, $3.8 million was allocated to IPRD. Of the total Kagoor purchase price, $1.9 million was allocated to IPRD. None of the Acorn Packet Solutions, Inc. (Acorn) or Redline Networks, Inc. (Redline) purchase prices were allocated to IPRD. Projects that qualify as IPRD represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and which have no alternative future use. Technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to a beta phase working prototype in which there is no remaining risk relating to the development. At the time of acquisition, Funk, Peribit, and Kagoor had multiple IPRD efforts under way for certain current and future product lines. For Funk, these efforts included development of new versions for the Steel Belted Radius (SBR), SBR High Availability (HA), and Mobile IP Module (MIM) II products all related to the Radius product offering. IPRD as of the acquisition date also included development of new versions for Endpoint Assurance, Proxy (Remote Control), and Odyssey product families. At the time of the Funk acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over the next four months at an estimated cost of approximately $0.9 million. These development efforts had been completed as of December 31, 2007. For Peribit, these efforts included the development of next versions of software for the Sequence Reducer (SR) family, Sequence Mirror (SM) family, the Central Management System (CMS) products, as well as a hardware program for both the SR and SM families. At the time of the Peribit acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over the next twelve months at an estimated cost of approximately $2.3 million. These development efforts had been completed as of December 31, 2007. For Kagoor, these efforts included a variety of signaling protocols and next generation products and operating systems. At the time of the Kagoor acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over the next eight months at an estimated cost of approximately $0.8 million. These development efforts had been completed as of December 31, 2007. Other Charges, Net Other charges are summarized as follows: Restructuring and Acquisition Related Reserves. In 2007, we recorded net restructuring and acquisition related charges of $0.7 million, of which $1.1 million pertained to bonus accruals associated with past acquisitions, partially offset by a benefit of $0.4 million pertaining to net restructuring adjustments. We recorded net restructuring and acquisition related bonus expenses of $5.9 million in 2006, of which $5.6 million was due to bonus accruals associated with the Funk and Acorn acquisitions and $0.3 million was due to net restructuring related charges, including $0.7 million in restructuring charges associated with 48 Table of Contents the initiation of a restructuring plan which focused on some product development costs reductions and the discontinuation of our SBC product. The $6.5 million restructuring and acquisition related benefit in 2005 primarily consisted of $6.9 million in adjustments related to our restructuring accrual when we re occupied a portion of the former NetScreen facility that was previously included in this acquisition related restructuring reserve, partially offset by a $0.3 million bonus and earn out accrual related to the Funk and Acorn acquisitions. Stock Option Investigation Costs. We recorded expenses of $6.0 million and $20.5 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, relating to professional fees and other costs in connection with our stock option investigation. There were no such charges in 2005. Stock Option Amendment and Tax Related Charges. We recorded $8.0 million and $10.1 million in operating expense during 2007 and 2006, respectively, in relation to the amendment of stock options and to the payment of certain taxes and penalties associated with stock option exercises by employees. There were no such charges in 2005. Net Settlement Gain. We recognized a net legal settlement gain of $5.3 million in 2007 in connection with cash settlement proceeds of $6.2 million, net of the $0.9 million legal expense related to direct transaction costs incurred in the third quarter of 2007. Other Income and Expenses Interest and Other Income, Interest and Other Expense, Gain on Minority Equity Investment, and Income Tax Provision The following table highlights other income, other expenses and income tax provision for the indicated periods (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 $ Change % Change 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Interest and other income, net $ 96.8 $ 100.7 $ (3.9 ) (4 )% $ 100.7 $ 55.2 $ 45.5 82 % Percentage of net revenues 3.4 % 4.4 % 4.4 % 2.7 % Gain on and (write down of) investments, net 6.7 6.7 100 % 1.3 (1.3 ) (100 )% Percentage of net revenues 0.2 % 0.1 % Income tax provision 149.8 104.4 45.4 43 % 104.4 146.8 (42.4 ) (29 )% Percentage of net revenues 5.3 % 4.5 % 4.5 % 7.1 % Interest and Other Income, Net Net interest and other income decreased $3.9 million, or 4%, in 2007 compared to 2006. This decrease was due to decreases in interest income resulting from a lower cash, cash equivalents and investment balance attributable to our funding of our repurchase of approximately $1.6 billion of our common stock during the first and second quarters of 2007. Partially offsetting the decreases was the higher interest yield combined with a higher average cash, cash equivalents and investment balances particularly in the beginning of 2007, primarily due to higher positive cash flows from operations compared to 2006. Interest and other expenses slightly increased in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to costs associated with our distributor financing program. Other interest and expenses include short term debt expenses, debt issuance cost amortization, foreign exchange losses and other expenses such as bank fees. Net interest and other income increased $45.5 million in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to a $45.8 million increase in interest income from 2005 to 2006 as a result of higher cash, cash equivalents and investment balances and an increase in rates of return realized from our investments throughout 2006. Also, interest and other expense decreased $0.3 million from 2005 and 2006 primarily due to lower portfolio management fees. 49 Table of Contents Gain on and (Write Down of) Investments, Net In June 2007, one of the companies in which we had a minority equity investment completed an initial public offering (IPO). As a result, we realized a gain of $6.7 million during 2007 based upon the difference between the market value of our investment at the time of the IPO and our cost basis. During 2006, none of our investments had any gain or loss. In 2005, we recorded a gain of $1.7 million in connection with a business combination transaction of a privately held company in our investment portfolio. Our cost basis of this equity investment was $1.0 million. We have certain minority equity investments in privately held companies that are carried at cost, adjusted for any impairment, as we do not have a controlling interest and do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over these companies. In addition, during 2005, we wrote down these investments by $0.4 million for changes in market value that we believed were other than temporary. Income Tax Provision Provision for income taxes increased to $149.8 million in 2007 from $104.4 million in 2006. The 2007 effective rate was 29.3% and differs from the federal statutory rate of 35.0% primarily due to the benefit of income in foreign jurisdictions which is subject to lower rates and research and development credits in the United States. Provision for income taxes decreased to $104.4 million in 2006 from $146.8 million in 2005. The 2006 effective rate was (11.6%) and differs from the federal statutory rate of 35.0% primarily due to the inability to benefit from a substantial portion of the goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2006. The 2005 effective rate was 29.5% and differs from the federal statutory rate of 35.0% due primarily to the benefit of tax credits, income in foreign jurisdictions taxed at lower rates and a reduction in deferred tax liabilities related to the repatriation in 2005 of $225.0 million under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by approximately $9.5 million for 2007, of which $8.4 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. Interest and penalties accrued for the same period were approximately $1.7 million. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months due to audit examinations. However, an estimate of the range of possible change cannot be made at this time due to the high uncertainty of the resolution of and or closure on open audits. We are currently under examination by the IRS for the 2004 tax year and by the German tax authorities for the 2005 tax year. Additionally, we have not reached a final resolution with the IRS on an adjustment it proposed for the 1999 and 2000 tax years. We are not under examination by any other major jurisdictions in which the Company files its income tax returns as of December 31, 2007. It is possible that the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months. However, an estimate of the range of possible change cannot be made at this time. We have provided for uncertain tax positions that require a FIN 48 liability. Additional details related to our income tax provision can be found in Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment Information A description of the products and services for each segment can be found in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We began to track financial information by our three segments in 2005 as our management structure and responsibilities began to measure the business based on management operating income (loss). A description of the measures included in management operating income (loss) can also be found in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We have included segment financial data for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 for comparative purposes. 50 Table of Contents Financial information for each segment used by management to make financial decisions and allocate resources is as follows (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 $ Change % Change 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Net revenues: Infrastructure $ 1,753.2 $ 1,413.4 $ 339.8 24 % $ 1,413.4 $ 1,371.6 $ 41.8 3 % Service Layer Technologies 573.8 479.9 93.9 20 % 479.9 399.4 80.5 20 % Service 509.1 410.3 98.8 24 % 410.3 293.0 117.3 40 % Total net revenues $ 2,836.1 $ 2,303.6 $ 532.5 23 % $ 2,303.6 $ 2,064.0 $ 239.6 12 % Management operating income (loss)(1): Infrastructure $ 495.5 $ 420.9 $ 74.6 18 % $ 420.9 $ 489.2 $ (68.3 ) (14 )% Service Layer Technologies (18.3 ) (11.3 ) (7.0 ) (62 )% (11.3 ) 10.4 (21.7 ) (209 )% Service 126.4 101.5 24.9 25 % 101.5 72.2 29.3 41 % Total management operating income 603.6 511.1 92.5 18 % 511.1 571.8 (60.7 ) (11 )% Amortization of purchased intangible assets (91.4 ) (97.3 ) 5.9 (6 )% (97.3 ) (85.2 ) (12.1 ) 14 % Stock based compensation expense (88.0 ) (87.6 ) (0.4 ) (87.6 ) (22.3 ) (65.3 ) N/M Stock based compensation related payroll tax (7.7 ) (2.7 ) (5.0 ) 185 % (2.7 ) (2.9 ) 0.2 (10 )% Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets (1,283.4 ) 1,283.4 (100 )% (1,283.4 ) (5.9 ) (1,277.5 ) N/M In process research and development (11.0 ) 11.0 (100 )% Other expense, net(2) (9.4 ) (37.9 ) 28.5 (75 )% (37.9 ) (3.5 ) (34.4 ) N/M Total operating income (loss) 407.1 (997.8 ) 1,404.9 141 % (997.8 ) 441.0 (1,438.8 ) N/M Interest and other income, net 96.8 100.7 (3.9 ) (4 )% 100.7 55.2 45.5 82 % Gain on (write down of) investments, net 6.7 6.7 100 % 1.3 (1.3 ) (100 )% Income (loss) before income taxes $ 510.6 $ (897.1 ) $ 1,407.7 157 % $ (897.1 ) $ 497.5 $ (1,394.6 ) N/M (1) Prior year information has been reclassified to conform to our current year presentation.

Infrastructure management operating income increased $74.6 million, or 18%, from 2006 to $495.5 million in 2007 due to revenue growth outpacing expense growth. Our increase in revenue was partially offset by our continued investments in research and development efforts as we seek to continue our innovation of products and expand our Infrastructure product portfolio. We also allocate sales and marketing, general and administrative, as well as facility and information technology expenses to the Infrastructure segment generally based on headcount and revenue. In 2007, our sales and marketing expenses decreased slightly as a percentage of net revenues but increased in absolute dollars as we increased our efforts to reach enterprise and service provider customers. We will continue to make these investments to expand our product features and functionality based upon the trends in the market place. Infrastructure management operating income decreased $68.3 million, or 14%, from 2005 to $420.9 million in 2006 primarily due to higher personnel related costs associated with our investments in product innovation for next generation core and edge infrastructure products as well as increased operating expenses associated with marketing related efforts and improvements to our internal infrastructure, partially offset by savings in sales expense during 2006 as we increasingly leveraged our existing distribution channel. SLT Operating Segment An analysis of the change in revenue for the SLT segment, and the change in units, can be found in the section titled Net Revenues. 52 Table of Contents SLT management operating loss increased $7.0 million, or 62%, from 2006 to $18.3 million in 2007 due to product mix and increases in manufacturing related costs. The loss was primarily due to our effort to build a foundation to help enable future SLT revenue growth and due to slight decreases in the SLT product gross margins. The increase in SLT operating expenses was due in large part to our increased allocated expenses to the SLT segment from both information technology investments and the higher variable compensation expenses associated with company wide revenue growth. Additionally, we strategically invested in our research and development efforts to develop technologies and products for the JUNOS platform. In an effort to control costs, we have moved a significant portion of the SLT development organization to lower cost regions while expanding our product portfolio. SLT management operating loss was also impacted by continued investments in our sales and distribution channels. We allocate sales and marketing, general and administrative, as well as facility and information technology expenses to the SLT segment generally based on revenue and headcount. In the third quarter of 2007, we increased our allocation of such expenses to the SLT segment, compared to the same period in 2006, primarily due to information technology investments and the higher variable compensation expenses associated with company wide revenue increases. SLT gross margin decreased slightly in 2007, as compared to 2006, due to higher manufacturing costs associated with newer and more complex products. Such higher manufacturing costs were partially offset as we realized the benefit of our cost reduction efforts of moving more manufacturing to lower cost regions. The increases in SLT operating expenses were partially offset by our revenue growth especially in the fourth quarter of 2007 due to customers demands for security products, particularly Firewall, and due to typical quarterly seasonality. We generally experienced quarterly seasonality and fluctuations in the demand for our SLT products, particularly in the fourth quarter, which may result in greater variations in our quarterly operating results. The SLT segment incurred a management operating loss of $11.3 million in 2006, compared to the management operating income of $10.4 million in 2005, due primarily to higher product and personnel related costs, partially offset by higher SLT net revenues and gross margin. Increases in personnel related costs were primarily related to headcount growth in order to support product innovation, new products sales and a larger customer base. We made a strategic decision to invest more into the enterprise and SLT markets to drive increased revenues and SLT productivity in the future. Service Operating Segment An analysis of the change in revenue for the Service segment can be found above in the section titled Net Revenue. Service management operating income increased $24.9 million, or 25%, from 2006 to $126.4 million in 2007 by achieving economies of scale and cost control initiatives. Revenue growth surpassed cost of service expense growth in 2007 primarily due to our growth in installed base of equipment being serviced. We also increased our service offerings and customer service infrastructure. Our Service gross margin slightly decreased from 2006 to 2007 as we increased our headcount to build our global customer service and professional service organizations. We expanded our customer service center in both North America and India as well as increased our resources for supporting network build outs and deployments by our customers. Service management operating income was also impacted by sales and marketing, general and administrative expenses as well as facilities and information systems management allocations to the service segment. Service gross margin percentages as well as Service management operating income increased from 2005 to 2006 due primarily to improved economies of scale achieved by faster revenue growth through the Infrastructure products and the SLT products relative to the increases in operating costs. In absolute dollars, employee related expenses increased in 2006 as a result of increased service related headcount from 476 to 611 individuals. Expenses associated with spare components also increased in 2006 to support increased demands driven by additional service contracts as a result of our growing installed base. Stock Based Compensation and Related Payroll Taxes Stock based compensation expense increased by $0.4 million in 2007 as compared to 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to new stock options and RSU grants, partially offset by the lower stock option expense in 2007 as a result of the acceleration of the vesting of certain unvested and out of the money stock options 53 Table of Contents completed in December 2005 (2005 stock option vesting acceleration). Stock based compensation related payroll tax expense increased $5.0 million in 2007. These expenses represent employment taxes we incurred in connection with our employee stock programs. Changes in such expenses are primarily attributable to the timing of the stock options exercises by our employees. We experienced a considerable increase in these expenses due to the increase in our share price occurring in 2007. In contrast, we had restrictions on stock option exercises during 2006. Stock based compensation expense increased by $65.3 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to the adoption of FAS 123R. Stock based compensation related payroll tax expense decreased $0.2 million in 2006, compared to 2005 primarily due to restrictions on stock option exercises in 2006 as a result of our delayed periodic filings with the SEC. In Process Research and Development There were no IPRD charges in 2007 and 2006. We recognized IPRD charges of $11.0 million 2005 in connection with the acquisitions completed during the year. Restructuring Charges in Cost of Product Revenues There was no restructuring charges included in cost of product revenues during 2007 and 2005. We recognized restructuring charges in cost of product revenues of $1.4 million for 2006 in connection with the restructuring plan implemented during the year. Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets, Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Other Expense, Gain on Investments, and Net Interest and Other Income See Results of Operations section for further information. Key Performance Measures In addition to the financial metrics included in the consolidated financial statements, we use the following key performance measures to assess operating results: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Days sales outstanding (DSO)(a) 42 38 42 Book to bill ratio(b) 1 1 1 (a) Days sales outstanding, or DSO, is calculated as the ratio of ending accounts receivable, net of allowances, divided by average daily net sales for the preceding 90 days. (b) Book to bill ratio represents the ratio of customer orders divided by the sum of product shipments and service invoicing during the respective period. 54 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview We have funded our business by issuing securities and through our operating activities. The following table shows our capital resources (in millions): December 31, December 31, 2007 2006 $ Change % Change Working capital $ 1,175.3 $ 1,759.2 $ (583.9 ) (33 )% Cash and cash equivalents 1,716.1 1,596.3 119.8 8 % Short term investments 240.4 443.9 (203.5 ) (46 )% Long term investments 59.3 574.1 (514.8 ) (90 )% Total cash, cash equivalents and available for sale investments $ 2,015.8 $ 2,614.3 $ (598.5 ) (23 )% The significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, short term investments and accounts receivable, reduced by accounts payable, accrued liabilities, debt and deferred revenue. Working capital decreased $583.9 million from December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2007 primarily due to the decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and available for sale investments balance in the first and second quarters of 2007. Our total cash, cash equivalents, and available for sale investments decreased by $598.5 million during 2007 primarily due to stock repurchases under the 2006 Stock Repurchase Program discussed below. Additionally, because the debt related to our outstanding zero coupon convertible notes is due within one year, we reclassified $399.5 million of debt underlying such notes from long term to short term liabilities and, as a result, further reduced our working capital. In 2007, we generated $786.5 million of cash from operations and $571.8 million from our investing activities. In addition, we received financing cash flows of $355.0 million from common stock issued to our employees through stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases. In 2007, we repurchased 69.4 million shares of our common stock for $1,623.2 million at an average purchase price of $23.37 per share. As of December 31, 2007, our 2006 Stock Repurchase Program had remaining authorized funds of $376.8 million. We may repurchase additional shares opportunistically under this program, subject to a review of circumstances at the time. See Note 15 in Item 8 for discussion of our stock repurchase activity in 2008. In June 2007, we entered into a senior secured margin lending agreement with a third party financial institution for a maximum credit facility of $400.0 million, or 90% of the fair market value of the underlying collateral, to establish a flexible draw down facility to fund additional stock repurchases, as necessary. This credit facility bore a floating interest rate equal to the three month USD LIBOR plus 40 basis points per annum and, if utilized, would be secured by our publicly traded fixed income securities portfolio equivalent to 111% of any outstanding balance. This credit facility was terminated on September 26, 2007. We did not utilize this credit facility at any time. Net accounts receivable increased $130.3 million, or 52%, to $379.8 million from December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2007 primarily due to an increase in revenue and shipment linearity. DSO was 42 days as of December 31, 2007 as compared to 38 days as of December 31, 2006. The increase in DSO was primarily a result of shipment linearity and the mix of customers we shipped to in the fourth quarter of 2007. Shipment linearity represents the rate at which products are shipped during a period. Our distributor financing program had minimal impact on DSO during 2007. Approximately $10.0 million of receivables sold under the distributor financing program had not been recognized in net revenues as of December 31, 2007 and therefore such amounts were recorded as debt financing in other accrued liabilities. Deferred revenue increased $127.7 million or 33% to $513.3 million as of December 31, 2007 as compared to December 31, 2006. Product and service deferred revenue increased $43.2 million and $84.5 million, respectively, in 2007. Our product deferred revenue increased due to increases in the amount of product shipments not having met revenue recognition criteria and service deferred revenue increased due to an increase in the installed base of equipment under service contract. 55 Table of Contents Liquidity and capital resources may also be impacted by acquisitions and investments in strategic relationships we may make in the networking equipment and information security markets. If we were to repurchase additional shares of our common stock under our 2006 Stock Repurchase Program, our liquidity may be impacted. Additionally, a portion of our cash and investment balance is held overseas and may be subject to U.S. taxes if repatriated. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short term and long term investments, together with cash generated from operations as well as cash generated from the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan will be sufficient to fund our operations, repayment of outstanding debt, and growth. We believe our working capital is sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for capital expenditures, commitments, repurchases of our common stock, and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations through at least the next 12 months. However, our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending on many factors, including: the overall levels of sales of our products and gross profit margins; our business, product, capital expenditure and research and development plans; the market acceptance of our products; repurchases of our common stock; issuance and repayment of debt; litigation expenses, settlements and judgments; volume price discounts and customer rebates; the levels of accounts receivable that we maintain; acquisitions of other businesses, assets, products or technologies; changes in our compensation policies; capital improvements for new and existing facilities; technological advances; our competitors responses to our products; our relationships with suppliers and customers; expenses related to our future restructuring plans, if any; tax expense associated with stock based awards; issuance of stock based awards and the related payment in cash for withholding taxes in the current year and possibly during future years; the level of exercises of stock options and stock purchases under our equity incentive plans; and general economic conditions and specific conditions in our industry and markets, including the effects of international conflicts and related uncertainties. Cash Requirements and Contractual Obligations Our principal commitments primarily consist of obligations outstanding under the Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2008 (Senior Notes), operating leases, purchase commitments, tax liabilities and other contractual obligations. The following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of December 31, 56 Table of Contents 2007 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in millions): Less than More than Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Other Operating leases, net of committed subleases(a) $ 221.3 $ 49.0 $ 117.2 $ 43.6 $ 11.5 $ Senior Notes(b) 399.5 399.5 Purchase commitments(c) 102.8 102.8 Tax liabilities(d) 41.5 41.5 Other contractual obligations(e) 44.4 21.9 22.5 Total $ 809.5 $ 573.2 $ 139.7 $ 43.6 $ 11.5 $ 41.5 (a) Our contractual obligations under operating leases primarily relate to our leased facilities under our non cancelable operating leases. Rent payments are allocated to costs and operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. We occupy approximately 1.8 million square feet world wide under operating leases. The majority of our office space is in North America, including our corporate headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. Our longest lease expires in May 2016. (b) Our principal commitment as of December 31, 2007 was our outstanding Senior Notes due June 15, 2008. The Senior Notes were issued in June 2003 and are senior unsecured obligations, rank on parity in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured debt, and rank senior to all of our existing and future debt that expressly provides that it is subordinated to the notes. The Senior Notes bear no interest, but are convertible into shares of our common stock, subject to certain conditions, at any time prior to maturity or their prior repurchase by Juniper Networks. The conversion rate is 49.6512 shares per each $1,000 principal amount of convertible notes, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. This is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $20.14 per share. The carrying value of the Senior Notes as of December 31, 2007 was $399.5 million, which was included in current liabilities as the debt is due in less than one year. (c) In order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply, our contract manufacturers place non cancelable, non returnable (NCNR) orders for components based on our build forecasts. As of December 31, 2007, there were NCNR component orders placed by our contract manufacturers with a value of $102.8 million. The contract manufacturers use the components to build products based on our forecasts and on purchase orders we have received from our customers. Generally, we do not own the components and title to the products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon delivery at a designated shipment location. If the components go unused or the products go unsold for specified periods of time, we may incur carrying charges or obsolete materials charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders. As of December 31, 2007, we had accrued $22.2 million based on our estimate of such charges. (d) Tax liabilities include the long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet for unrecognized tax positions. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. (e) Other contractual obligations consist of the escrow amount of $2.2 million and bonus accrual of $0.7 million in connection with past acquisitions, a software subscription requiring payments of $5.0 million in both January 2008 and January 2009 and a joint development agreement requiring quarterly payments of $3.5 million through January 2010. 57 Table of Contents Summary of Cash Flows Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $786.5 million, $755.6 million, and $642.9 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The cash provided by operating activities for each period was due to our net income (loss) adjusted by: Non cash charges of $257.5 million, $1,536.4 million, and $307.4 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, primarily related to depreciation and amortization expenses, stock based compensation, tax benefit of employee stock option plans, in process research and development from acquisitions, debt issuance costs, restructuring expense, and impairment charges. Non cash charges in 2007 and 2006 were reduced by the excess tax benefit from stock based compensation of $19.7 million and $9.7 million, respectively, and a gain on a minority equity investment of $6.7 million. Non cash charges in 2006 also included charges of $1,283.4 million related to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. In 2005 non cash charges included $128.1 million of tax benefit from employee stock options. Beginning in 2006, tax benefit from employee stock options, in accordance with FAS 123R, are no longer included in cash flows from operations but rather are included in financing activities. Non cash charges in 2005 also included an in process research and development charge, a benefit from the reversal of NetScreens acquisition related liabilities and a loss due to the impairment of an equity investment, partially offset by gains associated with available for sale investments. Net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $168.2 million, $220.6 million, and $(15.1) million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, were generally generated in the normal course of business. These changes are highlighted as follows: Net cash increases in 2007 were primarily attributable to increases in accounts payable of $34.9 million, an increase in accrued compensation of $48.3 million, an increase in taxes payable of $71.4 million and an increase in deferred revenue of $127.7 million. The increase in accounts payable was due to the timing of payments to contract manufacturers and the growth of our business. The increase in accrued compensation was due to an increase in headcount, an increase in stock option exercises and the removal of the suspension on employee purchases of shares under ESPP. The increase in taxes payable was due to the increase in the tax provision, movement of deferred tax assets, and timing of payments. The increase in deferred revenue was due to the growing installed base and customer payments in advance of product acceptance. In addition, these increases in cash flows from operations were partially offset by a negative cash flow of $120.9 million primarily due to an increase in net accounts receivable in 2007, which was primarily due to the timing of shipments and the mix of customers who purchased our products, as we shipped a larger amount of products late in the fourth quarter of 2007 and such invoices would not come due until after December 31, 2007. Net cash increases in 2006 were primarily attributable to increases in deferred revenue of $132.8 million due to the growing installed base and customer payments in advance of product acceptance. The increase in operating cash flows was also due to the decreases in accounts receivable of $20.7 million and aggregate decreases in prepaid expenses, other current assets and other long term assets of $23.0 million. Accounts payable increased $13.6 million and accrued compensation increased $12.7 million primarily due to the costs of headcount increases and related employee bonuses. Changes in taxes payable and other accrued liabilities contributed $18.3 million to cash flows from operations in 2006. Net cash used in 2005 from changes was primarily attributable to increases in net accounts receivable of $68.1 million and decreases in other accrued liabilities of $100.7 million and accrued warranty of $3.7 million, partially offset by decreases in the prepaid expenses, other current assets and other long term assets accounts of $5.3 million, increases in income taxes payable of $26.6 million, increases in deferred revenue of $64.3 million, increases in accounts payable of $50.3 million and increases in accrued compensation of $10.9 million. 58 Table of Contents Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities was $571.8 million and $11.9 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities was $583.7 million for 2005. Investing activities primarily included the purchases and sale or maturities of available for sale securities, the purchase and sale of equity investments, net cash used in acquisitions and capital expenditures. Net sales and maturities of investments in available for sale securities were $1,029.1 million in 2007, compared to net sales and maturities of $632.1 million for 2006, as we used cash to fund our stock repurchase program described under the financing activities section below. Purchases of available for sale securities used $298.6 million in 2007 compared to $516.1 million in 2006 primarily due to the funding of our stock repurchase program and our investment strategy during 2007. Positive net cash flows of $115.9 million generated from the sales, maturities and purchases of available for sale securities in 2006 was primarily due to the increased cash and cash equivalent holdings as a result of higher short term interest rates. Purchases and sales or maturities of available for sale securities used net cash of $131.0 million in 2005. Capital expenditures increased $44.8 million to $146.9 million in 2007 and $3.9 million to $102.1 million in 2006 mainly to support new product developments and overseas expansions. Capital expenditures of $98.2 million in 2005 mainly used in support of new product developments, overseas expansions and business acquisitions. Cash flows related to restricted cash decreased by $27.9 million, from a cash inflow of $20.5 million in 2006 to a cash outflow of $7.4 million in 2007, primarily due to the funding to the DO insurance trust to increase coverage due to the growth of our company. In 2005, we used cash of $309.9 million for the 2005 acquisitions, $34.8 million for restricted cash funding to escrow accounts in relation to the 2005 acquisitions, and $9.8 million for minority equity investment. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $1,238.5 million and $89.6 million for 2007 and 2006 respectively. In 2007 we repurchased 69.4 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $23.37 per share, or a total of $1,623.2 million. In 2006, we repurchased 10.1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $18.51 per share, or a total of $186.4 million. In addition, cash was provided during both periods from the issuance of common stock related to employee option exercises and stock purchase plans for a total of $355.0 million and $87.1 million during 2007 and 2006, respectively. In 2007 and 2006, tax benefits of $19.7 million and $9.7 million, respectively, from tax deductions in excess of the expense recognized for employee stock options was presented as financing cash flows due to the adoption of FAS 123R, beginning on January 1, 2006. Tax deductions in excess of the expense recognized for employee stock options were included in operating cash flows in 2005 before the adoption of FAS 123R. Approximately $10.0 million of receivables sold under our distributor financing program had not been recognized as revenue as of December 31, 2007 and therefore such amounts were recorded as net borrowings under cash flows from financing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $146.0 million in 2005 primarily due to common stock issued in relation to employee option exercises and purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition, which is incorporated herein by reference. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types and maturities. In addition, a portion of our cash and marketable securities are held in non U.S. domiciled countries. These securities are generally classified as available for sale and, consequently, are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 59 Table of Contents At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings of our investment portfolio. We do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures. The following tables present hypothetical changes in fair value of the financial instruments held at December 31, 2007 and 2006 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates (in millions): Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Fair Value as of Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Rate Decrease of X Basis Points (BPS) December 31, Rate Increase of X BPS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 2007 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS Government treasury and agencies $ 68.4 $ 68.1 $ 67.7 $ 67.4 $ 67.0 $ 66.7 $ 66.3 Corporate bonds and notes 108.3 107.5 106.7 105.9 105.1 104.3 103.5 Other 370.3 370.1 370.0 369.9 369.7 369.6 369.5 Total $ 547.0 $ 545.7 $ 544.4 $ 543.2 $ 541.8 $ 540.6 $ 539.3 Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Fair Value as of Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Rate Decrease of X Basis Points (BPS) December 31, Rate Increase of X BPS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 2006 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS Government treasury and agencies $ 297.5 $ 296.0 $ 294.5 $ 293.0 $ 291.6 $ 290.1 $ 288.6 Corporate bonds and notes 520.4 517.7 515.0 512.3 509.6 506.8 504.1 Asset backed securities and other 333.9 333.4 332.9 332.4 331.9 331.4 331.0 Total $ 1,151.8 $ 1,147.1 $ 1,142.4 $ 1,137.7 $ 1,133.1 $ 1,128.3 $ 1,123.7 These instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading. The modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (BPS), 100 BPS and 150 BPS, which are representative of the historical movements in the Federal Funds Rate. Foreign Currency Risk and Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts Periodically, we use derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate transaction gains and losses generated by certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. These derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other income (expense) in the same period as the changes in the fair value from the re measurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. These foreign exchange contracts have maturities between one and two months. Our sales and costs of revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Our operating expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the British Pound, the Euro, Indian Rupee, and Japanese Yen. Periodically, we use foreign currency forward and or option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to operating expenses. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of less than one year. The effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and, upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction, is subsequently reclassified into the consolidated statements of operations line item to which the hedged transaction relates. We record any ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments, which was immaterial during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, in other income (expense) on our consolidated statements of operations. The increase in operating expenses including research and development, sales and marketing, as well as general and administrative expenses, due to foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, was approximately 2% in 2007. 60 Table of Contents Equity Price Risk Our portfolio of publicly traded equity securities is inherently exposed to equity price risk as the stock market fluctuates. We monitor our equity investments for impairment on a periodic basis. In the event that the carrying value of the equity investments exceeds its fair value, and we determine the decline in value to be other than temporary, we reduce the carrying value to its current fair value. We do not purchase our equity securities with the intent to use them for trading or speculative purposes. The aggregate fair value of our marketable equity securities was $8.6 million and $0.8 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. A hypothetical 30% adverse change in the stock prices of our portfolio of publicly traded equity securities would result in an immaterial loss. In addition to publicly traded securities, we have also invested in privately held companies. These investments are carried at cost. The aggregate cost of our investments in privately held companies was $23.3 million and $20.4 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 61 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This Annual Report on Form 10 K (Report), including the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward looking statements regarding future events and the future results of our Company that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the industry in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management. Words such as expects, anticipates, targets, goals, projects, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. These forward looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this Report under the section entitled Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I and elsewhere, and in other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), specifically the most recent reports on Form 10 Q. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason. The following discussion is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingencies. In the course of operating our business, we routinely make decisions as to the timing of the payment of invoices, the collection of receivables, the manufacturing and shipment of products, the fulfillment of orders, the purchase of supplies, and the building of inventory and spare parts, among other matters. Each of these decisions has some impact on the financial results for any given period. In making these decisions, we consider various factors including contractual obligations, customer satisfaction, competition, internal and external financial targets and expectations, and financial planning objectives. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to sales returns, pricing credits, warranty costs, allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long term assets, especially goodwill and intangible assets, contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges, assumptions used in the valuation of stock based compensation, and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. To aid in understanding our operating results for the periods covered by this report, we have provided an executive overview and a summary of the significant events that affected the most recent fiscal year and a discussion of the nature of our operating expenses. These sections should be read in conjunction with the more detailed discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in this Item 7, our Risk Factors section included in Item 1A of Part I, and our audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in Item 8 of Part II of this report. 31 Table of Contents Executive Overview Our 2007 performance was the result of a combination of strong market demand for networking and security products as well as our focused execution and market share gains. In addition, we began shipment of several new products which contributed to our revenue growth during the year. During 2007, we also implemented a series of operational excellence initiatives. These initiatives are intended to strengthen the management systems and processes throughout our organization to support our growth. Total Reportable Segments (In millions, except percentages) Consolidated Infrastructure SLT Service Net revenues $ 2,836.1 $ 1,753.2 $ 573.8 $ 509.1 Year over year net revenues increase 23 % 24 % 20 % 24 % Management operating income (loss) $ 603.6 $ 495.5 $ (18.3 ) $ 126.4 Year over year management operating income increase (decrease) 18 % 18 % (62 )% 25 % Operating income $ 407.1 Year over year operating income increase 141 % Net income $ 360.8 Year over year net income increase N/M Net income per share: Basic $ 0.67 Diluted $ 0.62 N/M Not meaningful. Net Revenues: Net revenue increased $532.5 million, or 23%, to $2,836.1 million in 2007, compared to 2006. We experienced growth in both product and service revenues, which represented 82.0% and 18.0% of our total net revenue in 2007. Product revenue increased $433.7 million, or 23%, to $2,327.0 million in 2007, compared to the year ago period. Service revenue increased $98.8 million, or 24%, to $509.1 million in 2007, compared to 2006. Infrastructure product, SLT product and Service revenues represented 61.8%, 20.2% and 18.0% of our total net revenues, respectively, for 2007. Our revenue performance and share gains were driven by Infrastructure product and SLT product sales. Infrastructure product revenue increased $339.8 million, or 24%, in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily attributable to revenue growth in our M and T series routers, as well as our recently introduced MX series routers. SLT product revenue increased in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily attributable to the increased sales of our firewall virtual private network (Firewall) products, including our recently introduced SSG320M and SSG350M firewall appliances, and to a lesser extent, increases in secure socket layer virtual private network (SSL), J series, and WAN Optimization products. Service revenue increased in 2007 over the prior year primarily due to the increase in our installed base of equipment under service contracts and, to a lesser extent, growth in professional service revenue. New Infrastructure products shipped in 2007 include the T1600 router and our MX series product family. Our T1600 product is a high capacity and energy efficient core router. Our MX series family of Ethernet Service Routers enables service providers to deliver advance services including IPTV and video on demand at scale. The MX series includes MX960, a large capacity and high density Carrier Ethernet platform, and MX480, which began shipping in the fourth quarter of 2007. New SLT products introduced in 2007 include the SSG320M and SSG350M products, which are purpose built appliances that deliver high performance and secure connectivity for regional and branch office. We also introduced new products within the J series service router family, such as J2320 and J2350, which are designed to enable enterprises to accelerate the secure delivery of business critical applications across their networks. Additionally, we continued to make enhancements and design updates to other SLT product families during 2007. 32 Table of Contents From a geographical perspective, net revenues grew across the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia Pacific (APAC) regions. Operating Margin: Operating income increased $1,404.9 million to $407.1 million in 2007, compared to an operating loss of $997.8 million in 2006. Operating margin was 14.4% in 2007 as compared to 43.3% in 2006. The increase in operating margin was primarily attributable to decreases in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. Such decreases were largely due to the goodwill and intangible impairment charges of $1,283.4 million in 2006 and the absence of such charges in 2007. Additionally, to a lesser extent, operating margin improved due to the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue as well as decreases in other charges associated with our internal stock option investigation, partially offset by increases in research and development expenses in 2007 as compared to 2006. Net Income and Net Income Per Share: Net income was $360.8 million, or $0.62 per share on a diluted basis, in 2007, compared to a net loss of $1,001.4 million, or $1.76 per share on a diluted basis, in 2006. The increases in 2007 were primarily attributable to the goodwill and intangible impairment charges of $1,283.4 million in 2006 that were absent in 2007 as well as the revenue growth and an increase in operating margin as discussed above. Other Financial Highlights: We used $1,623.2 million to repurchase 69.4 million shares of our common stock in 2007. Cash used in our stock repurchases was offset by cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and common stock issued to our employees in connection with our equity incentive plans of $786.5 million, $571.8 million, and $355.0 million, respectively, in 2007. Significant Events Business and Market Environment In 2007, we benefited from the continued progress by our service provider customers in the build out of Next Generation Networks (NGN) designed to support a fast and cost effective deployment of multiple types of services (multi play services), such as voice, data, and video, that enable our customers to develop new sources of revenue and profitability. We maintained a strong position in the Infrastructure product business and gained share in key market segments. We also experienced an increased interest in our SLT portfolio due to increased network demand from our enterprise customers as well as growth from service providers using our SLT products for both managed service offerings and outsourced solutions for their customers. Additionally, we continued our momentum in the enterprise market for our SLT products as well as routing products portfolio. We now serve over 95 of the Fortune 100 companies and more than 30,000 enterprise customers worldwide. In addition, over 45 out of the 50 state governments in the United States have deployed our technologies. We believe our innovation and market momentum have enabled us to maintain relationships with our partners, including strategic resellers Alcatel Lucent, Ericsson, Inc., and Nokia Siemens Networks B.V. (NSN), while developing broader relationships with technology leaders such as International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) and Microsoft Corporation to better serve our customers. Stock Repurchase Activity We repurchased and retired 69.4 million common shares, at an average price of $23.37 per share for a total of $1,623.2 million as part of our $2.0 billion common stock repurchase program approved by our Board in July 2006 and February 2007 (the 2006 Stock Repurchase Program). As of December 31, 2007, our 2006 Stock Repurchase Program had a remaining authorization of $376.8 million for repurchases. See Note 15 in Item 8 for discussion of our stock repurchase activity in 2008. Stock Option Investigation and Amendment of Certain Stock Options In 2007, we completed the restatement of our historical financial statements as a result of our independent stock option investigation and review of historical stock compensation practices. In addition, we regained compliance with listing standards of the NASDAQ Global Select Market. We recorded $6.0 million in operating 33 Table of Contents expenses during 2007 in connection with this stock option investigation, compared to $20.5 million and nil in 2006 and 2005, respectively. In April 2007, we completed a tender offer to amend certain options granted under the Juniper Networks, Inc. Amended Restated 1996 Stock Plan and the Juniper Networks, Inc. 2000 Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan that had original exercise prices per share that were less than the fair market value per share of the common stock underlying the option on the options grant date, as determined by us for financial accounting purposes. Under this tender offer, employees subject to taxation in the United States and Canada had the opportunity to increase their strike price on affected options to the appropriate fair market value per share on the date of grant so as to avoid unfavorable tax consequences under United States Internal Revenue Code Section 409A (409A issue) or Canadian tax laws and regulations. In exchange for increasing the strike price of these options, we committed to make a cash payment to employees participating in the offer so as to make these employees whole for the incremental strike price as compared to their original option exercise price. In connection with the offer, we amended options to purchase 4.3 million shares of our common stock in 2007 and made aggregate cash payments of $7.6 million to offer participants in January 2008. We accrued this aggregate payment liability and recognized an operating expense for the corresponding amount during 2007. Settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission On August 28, 2007, we announced that the Commissioners of the SEC authorized the settlement between us and the SEC regarding the previously disclosed SEC inquiry into our historical stock option granting practices. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SECs complaint, we agreed to settle the charges by consenting to a permanent injunction against any future violations of the antifraud, reporting, books and records and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws. No monetary penalties were assessed against us in conjunction with this settlement. This settlement concludes the SECs formal investigation of the company with respect to our historical stock option granting practices. Adoption of FIN 48 We adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, (FIN 48) on January 1, 2007, the first day of fiscal 2007. Under FIN 48, an entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold. The cumulative effect of applying FIN 48 was a $19.2 million increase to the opening balance of accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2007 and a $1.0 million increase to goodwill. As of the date of adoption, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $85.2 million, of which $70.8 million, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. In accordance with our accounting policy, we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations. This policy did not change as a result of the adoption of FIN 48. We accrued interest expense and penalties of $4.1 million within other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of the date of adoption. We conduct business globally and, as a result, we or one or more of our subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as Ireland, Hong Kong, U.K., France, Germany, The Netherlands, Japan, China, Australia, and the U.S. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non U.S. income tax examinations for years before 2003, although carryforward attributes that were generated prior to 2003 may still be adjusted upon examination by the IRS if the attributes either have been or will be used in a future period. 34 Table of Contents Nature of Expenses Most of our manufacturing, repair and supply chain operations are outsourced to independent contract manufacturers. Accordingly, most of our cost of revenues consists of payments to our independent contract manufacturers for the standard product costs. The independent contract manufacturers produce our products using design specifications, quality assurance programs and standards that we establish. Controls around manufacturing, engineering and documentation are conducted at our facilities in Sunnyvale, California and Westford, Massachusetts. Our independent contract manufacturers have facilities primarily in Canada, China, Malaysia, and the United States. We generally do not own the components and title to products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon shipment. The contract manufacturers procure components based on our build forecasts and if actual component usage is lower than our forecasts, we may be, and have been in the past, liable for carrying or obsolete material charges. We have employees in our manufacturing and operations organization who manage relationships with our contract manufacturers, manage our supply chain, and monitor product testing and quality. Employee related costs have historically been the primary driver of our operating expenses and we expect this trend to continue. Employee related costs include items such as wages, commissions, bonuses, vacation, benefits, stock based compensation and travel. We had 5,879, 4,833, and 4,145 employees as of December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The year over year increases were primarily attributable to increases in our research and development, sales and customer service activities. Our headcount is expected to increase in 2008 as we continue to expand these functions. We accounted for stock based compensation under the fair value approach of FAS 123R in 2007 and 2006. In 2005, we accounted for stock based compensation under the intrinsic value approach of APB 25. Details of our stock based compensation expense are described in Note 1 and Note 9 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K. Facility and information technology departmental costs are allocated to other departments based on headcount. These departmental costs have increased in 2007 and 2006 due to increases in headcount and facility leases resulting from infrastructure systems added to support our growth and past acquisitions. Facility and information technology related headcount was 224, 177, and 168 as of December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. In 2008, we expect to further invest in our company wide information technology infrastructure as we implement our operational excellence initiatives. Our operating expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the British Pound, the Euro, Indian Rupee, and Japanese Yen. Changes in related currency exchange rates may affect our operating results. Periodically, we use foreign currency forward and or option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to operating expenses. The effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and, upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction, is subsequently reclassified into the consolidated statements of operations line item to which the hedged transaction relates. Any ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments is reported in other income (expense) on our consolidated statements of operations. The increase in operating expenses including research and development, sales and marketing, as well as general and administrative expenses, due to foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, was approximately 2% in 2007. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period. We regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from managements estimates. To the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future results of operations will be affected. 35 Table of Contents We believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition. Our products are integrated with software that is essential to the functionality of our equipment. Additionally, we provide unspecified upgrades and enhancements related to our integrated software through our maintenance contracts for most of our products. Accordingly, we account for revenue in accordance with Statement of Position No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, and all related interpretations. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery or performance has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Evidence of an arrangement generally consists of customer purchase orders and, in certain instances, sales contracts or agreements. Shipping terms and related documents, or written evidence of customer acceptance, when applicable, are used to verify delivery or performance. In instances where we have outstanding obligations related to product delivery or the final acceptance of the product, revenue is deferred until all the delivery and acceptance criteria have been met. We assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and the customers payment history to us. Accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts, estimated customer returns and pricing credits. For arrangements with multiple elements, such as sales of products that include services, we allocate revenue to each element using the residual method based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered items. Under the residual method, the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements. Vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately. We then recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with our policies for product and service revenue recognition. If vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of one or more undelivered items does not exist, revenue is deferred and recognized at the earlier of (i) delivery of those elements or (ii) when fair value can be established unless maintenance is the only undelivered element, in which case, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the contractual support period. Our ability to recognize revenue in the future may be affected if actual selling prices are significantly less than fair value. In addition, our ability to recognize revenue in the future could be impacted by conditions imposed by our customers. For sales to direct end users and value added resellers, we recognize product revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss, which is generally upon shipment. It is our practice to identify an end user prior to shipment to a value added reseller. For our end users and value added resellers, there are no significant obligations for future performance such as rights of return or pricing credits. A portion of our sales are made through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits and or rights of return. We recognize product revenue on sales made through these distributors upon sell through as reported to us by the distributors. Deferred revenue on shipments to distributors reflects the effects of distributor pricing credits and the amount of gross margin expected to be realized upon sell through. Deferred revenue is recorded net of the related product costs of revenue. We record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments, such as rebates and price protection, in the same period that the related revenue is recorded. The amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns and price protection credits, specific criteria included in rebate agreements, and other factors known at the time. Additional reductions to revenue would result if actual product returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates. In addition, we report revenue net of sales taxes. Services include maintenance, training and professional services. Maintenance is offered under renewable contracts. Revenue from maintenance service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the contractual support period, which is generally one to three years. Revenue from training and professional services is recognized as the services are completed or ratably over the contractual period, which is generally one year or less. We sell certain interests in accounts receivables as part of a distributor accounts receivable financing arrangement which was established by us with a major financing company. Accounts receivables sold under 36 Table of Contents this arrangement in advance of revenue recognition are accounted for as debt and were $10.0 million and nil as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Contract Manufacturer Liabilities. We outsource most of our manufacturing, repair and supply chain management operations to our independent contract manufacturers and a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of payments to them. Our independent contract manufacturers procure components and manufacture our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts are based on our estimates of future demand for our products, which are in turn based on historical trends and an analysis from our sales and marketing organizations, adjusted for overall market conditions. We establish reserves for carrying charges and obsolete material charges for excess components purchased based on historical trends. If the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecasted, which may be caused by factors outside of our control, we have contractual liabilities and exposures with the independent contract manufacturers, such as carrying costs and obsolete material exposures, which would have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability. Warranty Reserve. We generally offer a one year warranty on all of our hardware products and a 90 day warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the products. We establish reserves for estimated product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized. Although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, use of materials and technical labor costs and associated overhead incurred in correcting any product failure. Should actual product failure rates, use of materials or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, additional warranty reserves could be required, which could reduce gross margins. Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets. Goodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. The amounts and useful lives assigned to other intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization, and the amount assigned to in process research and development is expensed immediately. The value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, could be impacted by future adverse changes such as: (i) future declines in our operating results, (ii) a decline in the valuation of technology company stocks, including the valuation of our common stock, (iii) significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or the networking industry or (iv) failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results. We evaluate these assets on an annual basis as of November 1 or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. In the process of our annual impairment review, we use the market approach as well as the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method to determine the fair value of our intangible assets. Significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation. The estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business. It is possible, however, that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect. If our actual results, or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses, are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets, we could incur additional impairment charges. Stock Based Compensation. We account for stock based compensation in accordance with FAS No. 123R beginning in 2006. Under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (FAS 123R), stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the awards fair value as calculated by the Black Scholes Merton (BSM) option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period. The BSM model requires various highly subjective assumptions including volatility, forfeiture rates, and expected option life. If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly, stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. In conjunction with the adoption of FAS 123R, we also adopted the single approach method for valuing our stock based awards as well as the straight line method for amortizing the related stock based compensation expense under the modified prospective approach. Prior to the adoption of FAS 123R, we accounted for stock based compensation under the intrinsic value recognition provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25). 37 Table of Contents Income Taxes. Estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences and carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income based on the realization criteria set forth under FAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe to be more likely than not realizable. We believe it is more likely than not that forecasted income together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Similarly, if we subsequently realize deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation allowance would be reversed, resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings or a decrease in goodwill in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities may result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimate of tax liabilities is less than the amount ultimately assessed, a further charge to expense would result. On January 1, 2007, we adopted FIN 48. FIN 48 is an interpretation of FASB Statement 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and it seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on de recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosures and transition. Under FIN 48, an entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold. In addition, the application of FIN 48 may increase an entitys future effective tax rates and its future intra period effective tax rate volatility. Our cumulative effect of applying FIN 48 was a $19.2 million increase to the opening balance of accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2007 and a $1.0 million increase to goodwill. Loss Contingencies. We are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required. In addition, from time to time, we are involved in disputes, litigation and other legal actions. We are aggressively defending our current litigation matters; however, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and these actions or other third party claims against us may cause us to incur costly litigation and or substantial settlement charges. In addition, the resolution of any future intellectual property litigation may require us to make royalty payments, which could adversely impact gross margins in future periods. If any of those events were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We record a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the range of loss can be reasonably estimated. However, the actual liability in any such litigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to record additional expenses. 38 Table of Contents Results of Operations Net Revenues The following table shows total net product and service revenues and net product and service revenues as a percentage of total net revenues (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 $ Change % Change 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Net revenues: Product $ 2,327.0 $ 1,893.3 $ 433.7 23 % $ 1,893.3 $ 1,771.0 $ 122.3 7 % Percentage of net revenues 82.0 % 82.2 % 82.2 % 85.8 % Service 509.1 410.3 98.8 24 % 410.3 293.0 117.3 40 % Percentage of net revenues 18.0 % 17.8 % 17.8 % 14.2 % Total net revenues $ 2,836.1 $ 2,303.6 $ 532.5 23 % $ 2,303.6 $ 2,064.0 $ 239.6 12 % Our total net revenues increased $532.5 million, or 23% to $2,836.1 million in 2007 as compared to 2006. Our total net revenues increased $239.6 million, or 12% to $2,303.6 million in 2006 as compared to 2005. The increases in both years were primarily due to the demand growth in the markets we serve. In addition, we gained market share in several areas and capitalized on the opportunities in our targeted markets with our new and existing product and service offerings during 2007. Net Product Revenues Our net product revenue increased $433.7 million, or 23%, from 2006 to $2,327.0 million in 2007. The increase was the result of increased activity in both Infrastructure product and SLT product sales to service provider and enterprise markets. In particular we had success in selling our products to customers who are adopting NGN IP networks, which are designed to reduce total operating costs and to be able to offer multiple services over a single network. In addition, we had a number of new product releases and expanded into new emerging markets during 2007. Net product revenue grew $122.3 million, or 7% from 2005 to 2006, the majority of which was generated from our SLT product revenue growth in 2006. The following table shows total net product revenues and net product revenues as a percentage of total net revenues by product category (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 $ Change % Change 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Net product revenues: Infrastructure $ 1,753.2 $ 1,413.4 $ 339.8 24 % $ 1,413.4 $ 1,371.6 $ 41.8 3 % Percentage of net revenues 61.8 % 61.4 % 61.4 % 66.5 % SLT 573.8 479.9 93.9 20 % 479.9 399.4 80.5 20 % Percentage of net revenues 20.2 % 20.8 % 20.8 % 19.3 % Total net product revenues $ 2,327.0 $ 1,893.3 $ 433.7 23 % $ 1,893.3 $ 1,771.0 $ 122.3 7 % Infrastructure Product Revenues Infrastructure product revenues accounted for $1,753.2 million, or 61.8%, of total net revenues, and increased $339.8 million, or 24%, in 2007, compared to 2006. We benefited from the strong worldwide demand for high performance router products as our service provider customers seek simplified, scalable network infrastructures across fiber, cable and mobile access technologies to support increasing performance demands on their networks. The Infrastructure product revenue increase in 2007 was primarily attributable to increased revenue from our M , T , and 39 Table of Contents MX series router products driven by our service provider customers continued build out of NGN as their bandwidth requirement increases. Our service provider customers also moved towards NGNs designed to enable a fast and cost effective deployment of differentiating multi play services that allow them to generate new sources of revenue. Also contributing to the revenue growth was an increase in Infrastructure product sales to the content service provider and the enterprise markets. From a geographical perspective, we experienced strength in the Americas region. We also experienced revenue increases in APAC and EMEA. Infrastructure products accounted for $1,413.4 million, or 61.4%, of our total net revenues during 2006 and $1,371.6 million, or 66.5%, of our total net revenues during 2005. Infrastructure product net revenue grew by $41.8 million, or 3%, from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to continued success from a very significant year of growth in 2005, which strengthened our position as a supplier to the largest service providers in the world, particularly in the Americas and in EMEA. We experienced revenue growth in higher end infrastructure chassis products and increased penetration by our core and edge router portfolio as service providers acquired products for their NGNs and multi play service offerings. This growth was partially offset by a pause in the build out of NGNs and associated purchase decisions, particularly in Japan, as major carriers prepare for the next stage of bandwidth and services expansion, and a large product revenue deferral as of December 31, 2006 for products shipped to one of our largest customers. We track Infrastructure chassis revenue units recognized and ports shipped to analyze customer trends and indicate areas of potential network growth. Our Infrastructure product platforms are essentially modular, with the chassis serving as the base of the platform. Each chassis has a certain number of slots that are available to be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces. The modules are the components through which the router receives incoming packets of data from a variety of transmission media. The physical connection between a transmission medium and a module is referred to as a port. The number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the functionality and throughput offered by the module. Chassis revenue units represent the number of chassis on which revenue was recognized during the period. The following table shows infrastructure revenue units recognized and ports shipped: Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Unit Change % Change 2006 2005 Unit Change % Change Infrastructure chassis revenue units 11,195 10,211 984 10 % 10,211 9,977 234 2 % Infrastructure ports shipped 225,452 160,318 65,134 41 % 160,318 153,763 6,555 4 % Chassis revenue units increased 10% from 2006 to 2007 as our customers expanded the capacity in their existing networks. The increase was mainly due to the introduction of the MX series products, which are our Carrier Ethernet base routers. We also experienced growth in our M and T series products, driven by bandwidth demand as service provider customers sought to expand voice and video capability in their existing networks. Port shipment units increased by 41% in 2007 as compared to 2006. The increase was associated with the growth in chassis revenue units with larger expansion capacity and the customers need to differentiate themselves by providing feature rich multi play services. Chassis revenue units slightly increased from 2005 to 2006 due primarily to the sales of higher end T series and M series products and the inclusion of the chassis units related to a 2005 acquisition, partially offset by decreases in sales of lower end E series and M series products. Sales of higher end chassis units increased as our customers continued to adopt and expand IP networks in order to reduce total operating costs and to be able to offer multiple services over a single network. Port shipment units increased from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to the increase in port demands driven by the larger expansion capacity in the higher end chassis revenue units shipped during 2006, partially offset by the lower port capacity in the CTP series chassis revenue units. SLT Product Revenues SLT product revenues accounted for 20.2% of total net revenues and increased $93.9 million, or 20%, to $573.8 million in 2007, compared to 2006. The revenue increase was due to sales increases across the majority of the SLT product families particularly the Firewall, SSL, WAN Optimization and J series products. Our customers 40 Table of Contents demands for SLT products grew due to their increasing focus on addressing the risks associated with connecting and delivering critical network services and business applications. The integrated systems introduced prior to 2007, such as the ISG and SSG firewall products, gained traction in the market place and generated additional revenue in 2007. The revenue increase from our SSL products was due to our deployments of SSL solutions to enterprises and governments who were seeking to enhance their remote access to data and applications. We experienced considerable improvement in revenue from our WAN Optimization application acceleration platforms as customers sought to boost the responsiveness of their networks. All three geographic regions had significant growth in SLT sales during 2007. We experienced a growing demand for our SLT products in both the enterprise and service provider markets as we focused on cross selling more integrated products and solutions in the enterprise and service provider markets while leveraging partnerships with open standards based interoperability of our SLT products. In addition, we benefited from typical fourth quarter seasonality. We generally experienced seasonality and fluctuations in the demand for our SLT products, which may result in greater variations in our quarterly revenue. In January 2008, we announced a plan to phase out our DX product line. These products will be supported until 2013. We do not expect this plan to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. SLT products accounted for $479.9 million, or 20.8%, of our total net revenues in 2006 and $399.4 million, or 19.3%, of total net revenues during 2005. SLT product net revenue increased $80.5 million, or 20%, from 2005 to 2006 due to a growing demand and brand recognition for our SLT products from large enterprises and the U.S. Federal Government. Sales increased across various SLT product families including Firewalls, IDP, J series, DX, and SSL. In addition, the new products announced in 2006 and the DX and application acceleration products added to our portfolio through the various acquisitions in 2005 contributed to this increase. In addition, we experienced success in cross selling SLT products to service providers for both their own IT infrastructure and resale built upon the acquisitions we completed in 2005. A further part of the increase was due to successfully selling to much larger enterprise customers with increased footprint and complexity. The following table shows SLT revenue units recognized: Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Unit Change % Change 2006 2005 Unit Change % Change Service Layer Technologies units 239,021 183,575 55,446 30 % 183,575 170,181 13,394 8 % SLT product units increased in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily attributable to the growing demand for our SLT products in the market place. The 30% increase in the number of SLT units was greater than the revenue increase of 20% primarily due to the increased revenue from sales of our branch firewall products, which have lower average selling price than other SLT products. SLT product units increased 8% while SLT product revenue increased 20% in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to sales of high end firewalls. Net Service Revenues Net service revenues increased $98.8 million, or 24%, to $509.1 million in 2007, compared to 2006, and represent 18.0% of net revenues. The growth in service revenue was primarily driven by increased technical support service contracts associated with higher Infrastructure and SLT product sales, which have resulted in increased renewals and a larger installed base of equipment being serviced. Installed base is calculated by each customer based on the number of systems that the customers has under maintenance. A majority of our service revenue is earned from customers who purchase our products and enter into maintenance contracts that are generally for one year renewable periods. We also have multi year maintenance contracts. These contracts are typically for services such as 24 hour customer support, non specified updates and hardware repairs. We recognize revenue from service contracts as the services are completed or ratably over the period of the obligation. In addition to support services and professional services, we also provide educational services. Consistent with 2006, support service revenues represents 89% of net service revenues in 2007. To a lesser extent, professional services also contributed to the growth in net service revenues in 2007. Professional service revenue increased primarily due to large customer deployments requiring consulting services. 41 Table of Contents Net service revenues increased $117.3 million, or 40%, from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to the growth in support services driven by an increase in the installed base that we are servicing, as well as increased attach rates on new product sales, improved enterprise service infrastructure allowing more rapid implementation of services and the addition of new professional service offerings. Professional service revenue also increased, to a lesser extent, in 2006 compared to 2005 due primarily to maintenance related on site engineering services as well as additional consulting projects in 2006. Total Net Revenues by Geographic Region The following table shows total net revenues by geographic region (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006* $ Change % Change 2006* 2005* $ Change % Change Americas: United States $ 1,215.8 $ 950.3 $ 265.5 28 % $ 950.3 $ 879.0 $ 71.3 8 % Other 124.7 83.0 41.7 50 % 83.0 53.9 29.1 54 % Total Americas 1,340.5 1,033.3 307.2 30 % 1,033.3 932.9 100.4 11 % Percentage of net revenues 47.3 % 44.8 % 44.8 % 45.2 % Europe, Middle East and Africa 918.0 817.4 100.6 12 % 817.4 610.1 207.3 34 % Percentage of net revenue 32.4 % 35.5 % 35.5 % 29.6 % Asia Pacific 577.6 452.9 124.7 28 % 452.9 521.0 (68.1 ) 13 % Percentage of net revenues: 20.3 % 19.7 % 19.7 % 25.2 % Total $ 2,836.1 $ 2,303.6 $ 532.5 23 % $ 2,303.6 $ 2,064.0 $ 239.6 12 % * Prior year information has been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. We continue to experience varying distribution of revenue among our three geographic regions for the three years ended December 31, 2007 and we expect this trend to continue. Net revenues in the Americas region increased $307.2 million, or 30%, to $1,340.5 million in 2007 as compared to 2006. The Americas region represented 47.3% of net revenues in 2007, an increase of 2.5 percentage points over 2006. The increases were largely due to strength in the United States and in Latin America. Net revenue from the United States increased $265.5 million in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to revenue growth in the Infrastructure product segment from our service provider and internet content provider customers and, to a lesser extent, SLT product and Service segments. Net revenues from Latin America increased $39.1 million in 2007, compared to 2006, primarily due to strength in Brazil driven by sales to a major local carrier. Total 2006 revenue recorded by the Americas region grew by $100.4 million from its 2005 level and remained at approximately 45% of worldwide revenue, as compared to 2005, due to significant success in the United States and with the main service providers in Canada and various South American countries including Brazil and Argentina. Net revenue in the United States increased by $71.3 million in 2006 from 2005 due to continued success both with enterprise customers such as the U.S. Federal Government, as well as with major service providers in the United States. The increase was also due in part to sales to major internet content providers and cable providers. This success was partially offset by a significant product revenue deferral for products shipped to one of our largest customers. Net revenue in Americas as a percentage of total net revenue decreased slightly in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of the strong growth in EMEA. Net revenue in the EMEA region increased $100.6 million, or 12%, to $918.0 million in 2007, compared to 2006, due to increased Infrastructure product and SLT product revenues along with increased service revenue driven by strong bandwidth demands in the region. Revenue increased in Belgium, Ireland, United Kingdom, and France, 42 Table of Contents partially offset by a decrease in the Netherlands as well as revenue growth in the emerging markets such as Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Net revenue from EMEA as a percentage of net revenues decreased 3.1 percentage points to 32.4% in 2007 over 2006 primarily due to relative strength in the Americas region. Revenue in the EMEA region grew by $207.3 million, or 34%, in 2006, compared to 2005, due to significant success with NGN deployments across the region, in particular Sweden, the Netherlands, France, and Germany, as well as sales growth in emerging regions including Russia, Eastern Europe and the Middle East. As a result, net revenue from EMEA as a percentage of net revenues increased 5.9 percentage points to 35.5% in 2006 over 2005. Net revenue in the Asia Pacific region increased $124.7 million, or 28%, to $577.6 million in 2007, compared to 2006, due to increased revenue from Infrastructure products, SLT products and Service driven by demands from service providers as well as enterprise customers resulting from cross selling of our product portfolio. We experienced revenue growth across the region with strength in Korea, Australia, Malaysia, India and Indonesia. Revenue from the Asia Pacific region declined $68.1 million, or 13%, in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to the impact of certain NGN project decision delays in Japan driving revenue down year over year, partially offset by increased demands in China. NSN accounted for greater than 10% of our net product and service revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005. We expect that our largest customers, as well as key strategic partners, will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenues in 2008. Cost of Revenues The following table shows cost of product and service revenues and the related gross margin (GM) percentages (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 $ Change % Change 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Cost of revenues: Product $ 676.2 $ 555.1 $ 121.1 22 % $ 555.1 $ 506.3 $ 48.8 10 % GM percentage of revenue 70.9 % 70.7 % 70.7 % 71.4 % Service 251.4 199.2 52.2 26 % 199.2 147.2 52.0 35 % GM percentage of revenue 50.6 % 51.4 % 51.4 % 49.8 % Total cost of revenues $ 927.6 $ 754.3 $ 173.3 23 % $ 754.3 $ 653.5 $ 100.8 15 % GM percentage of revenue 67.3 % 67.3 % 67.3 % 68.3 % Cost of Product Revenues Product gross margin improved from 70.7% in 2006 to 70.9% in 2007. The slight increase in product gross margin was mainly due to favorable product mix and, to a lesser extent, improvements in standard costs of our Infrastructure products, partially offset by a slight decrease in our SLT product gross margin. The improvement of standard costs as a percentage of product revenue was primarily due to our increased purchases from contract manufacturers and suppliers in lower cost regions. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we employed 190 and 149 people, respectively, in our manufacturing and operations organization. These personnel manage relationships with our contract manufacturers, manage our supply chain, and monitor product testing and quality. Infrastructure product gross margin percentages improved slightly in 2007 compared to 2006. Our Infrastructure chassis revenue units increased 10% while our Infrastructure ports shipped increased 41% during 2007, on a year over year basis, compared to the Infrastructure product revenues increase of 24% for the year. We experienced a favorable product mix and derived a larger portion of revenues from richly configured high end M series and T series router products. We also generated revenues from high margin port shipments, which are add on components to the chassis routers. The increases in chassis units and port shipments were driven by bandwidth demand as customers are seeking to expand capabilities in their networks and to offer differentiating feature rich multi play services that allow them to generate new revenue sources. See further details in the Infrastructure Product Revenues section. 43 Table of Contents The gross margin improvement from Infrastructure products was offset by a slight decrease in our SLT product gross margin in 2007. The decrease in SLT product gross margin was primarily due to product mix, particularly from an increase in the mix of lower margin branch Firewall and J series products in 2007. In addition, higher manufacturing costs associated with newer and more complex products were also impacting SLT gross margin. The higher manufacturing costs were partially offset as we realized the benefit of our cost reduction efforts of moving more manufacturing to lower cost regions. See further details in the SLT Product Revenues section. Cost of product revenues increased $48.8 million, or 10%, in 2006 as compared to 2005. The increase was primarily attributable to increased product revenue in both the enterprise and service provider markets. Net product gross margin of 70.7% for 2006 slightly decreased, compared to 71.4% for 2005, primarily due to the impact of the mix of products and the mix of territories, partially offset by reduced manufacturing costs. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, we employed 149 and 134 people, respectively, in our manufacturing and operations organization. The increase in stock compensation expense in cost of product revenue from 2005 to 2006 of $0.9 million was primarily due to the impact of adopting FAS 123R on January 1, 2006. Product gross margins tend to fluctuate due to changes in the mix of products sold and our gross margins may be impacted as we introduce new products and manage production costs among multiple contract manufacturers or when our customers change the timing of their purchases. We will continue to seek reductions in our production costs as we enter into new markets, including markets with different pricing structures and cost structures. Our margins are impacted by changes in distribution channels and price competition as well as changes in the geographic mix of our sales. Sales discounts, warranty costs, changes in shipment volume, loss of cost savings due to changes in component pricing also impact gross margins. These factors, combined with how well we execute on our strategy and operating plans, may lead to margin variability. Cost of Service Revenues Cost of service revenues increased $52.2 million, or 26%, to $251.4 million in 2007 as compared to 2006. Service gross margin decreased by less than one percentage point to 50.6% in 2007 as compared to 2006. The increase in service costs and the decrease in gross margin were primarily attributable to increases in headcount related expenses associated with expanding our service delivery infrastructure and professional service organization, particularly in North America and in India, as well as increasing our resources for supporting network build outs and deployments by our customers. Service related headcount increased by 137 employees, or 22%, to 748 employees in 2007, compared to 611 in 2006. Employee salary and related expenses, including stock based compensation expense, represented the majority of the increases in cost of service revenues in 2007. Total employee salary and related expenses as a percentage of service revenues were approximately 25% for 2007 and 20% for 2006. Outside service expense increased as we used outside providers to support the increase in customer support contracts and professional engagements. Freight related expense increased due to the deployment of spare parts in supporting our growth overseas. Facility and IT expenses allocation to the cost of service revenues increased in 2007, which is consistent with other areas of our organization, due to our headcount growth and investment in internal infrastructure to support our growing business. Partially offsetting the increases was a decrease in spares expense due to the large spares purchase we made in 2006. Cost of service revenues increased $52.0 million, or 35%, to $199.2 million in 2006 as compared to 2005. The increase was a direct result of a larger installed base of products covered by service contracts. However, our service gross margin increased one percentage point from 2005 to 2006 as a result of improved efficiencies and economies of scale, which result in a better leveraged service organization. Total employee salary and related expenses as a percentage of service revenue were approximately 20% for 2006 and 20% for 2005; however, in absolute dollars, employee salary and related expenses increased from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to an investment in new customer service personnel, particularly to support our enterprise customers. Stock compensation expense in cost of service revenue also increased from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to the impact of adopting FAS 123R in 2006. In addition to personnel expenses, outside services costs increased from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to contracting for engineers to provide professional services revenue, particularly for the Middle East and other emerging markets. Spares and freight costs increased from 2005 to 2006 due to a significant investment in spares around the world to support the increase in customer contracts, particularly in the enterprise market. Finally, the costs associated with facilities, 44 Table of Contents depreciation and other expenses allocated to cost of service revenue increased from 2005 to 2006 due to increases in revenue and investment in infrastructure to support the growing business. Research and Development, Sales and Marketing and General and Administrative Expenses The table below highlights our operating expenses and operating income (loss) (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 $ Change % Change 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Research and development $ 623.0 $ 480.3 $ 142.7 30 % $ 480.3 $ 357.3 $ 123.0 34 % Sales and marketing 666.7 558.0 108.7 19 % 558.0 441.6 116.4 26 % General and administrative 116.4 97.1 19.3 20 % 97.1 75.0 22.1 29 % Amortization of purchased intangible assets 85.9 91.8 (5.9 ) (6 )% 91.8 85.2 6.6 8 % Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 1,283.4 (1,283.4 ) (100 )% 1,283.4 5.9 1,277.5 N/M In process research and development 11.0 (11.0 ) (100 )% Other charges, net 9.4 36.5 (27.1 ) (74 )% 36.5 (6.5 ) 43.0 N/M Total operating expenses $ 1,501.4 $ 2,547.1 $ (1,045.7 ) (41 )% $ 2,547.1 $ 969.5 $ 1,577.6 163 % Operating income (loss) $ 407.1 $ (997.8 ) $ 1,404.9 141 % $ (997.8 ) $ 441.0 $ (1,438.8 ) N/M N/M Not meaningful. The following table highlights our operating expenses and operating income (loss) as a percentage of net revenues: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Research and development 22.0 % 20.8 % 17.3 % Sales and marketing 23.5 % 24.2 % 21.4 % General and administrative 4.1 % 4.2 % 3.6 % Amortization of purchased intangible assets 3.0 % 4.0 % 4.1 % Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 55.7 % 0.3 % In process research and development 0.6 % Other charges, net 0.3 % 1.7 % (0.3 )% Total operating expenses 52.9 % 110.6 % 47.0 % Operating income (loss) 14.4 % (43.3 )% 21.4 % Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses include: the costs of developing our products from components to prototypes to finished products, the costs for outside services such as certifications of new products, and expenditures associated with equipment used for testing. Several components of our research and development effort require significant expenditures, such as the development of new components and the purchase of prototype equipment, the timing of which can cause quarterly variability in our expenses. We expense our research and development costs as they are incurred. Research and development expense increased $142.7 million, or 30%, and increased 1.2 percentage points of net revenues in 2007 over 2006. The increase was largely due to our commitment to continue innovation of our 45 Table of Contents products. In particular in 2007, we continued the development of our Ethernet products, including the MX series and our new EX series Ethernet switching products introduced in January 2008, as well as the development of our new T1600 product, which was released in November 2007. Personnel related expenses, which comprise the majority of our research and development expenses, increased primarily due to headcount growth and merit based salary increases in 2007. Research and development related headcount increased by 493 employees, or 24%, in 2007 to 2,563 employees as of December 31, 2007. Headcount increase was primarily due to additional hires in the engineering organization within the Infrastructure segment. In addition to personnel related expenses, we also increased prototype and lab equipment expenses in 2007 for the development of our new products. Additionally our allocated facilities and information technology, as well as depreciation expenses, for our research and development organization increased in 2007 due to increases in headcount from additional internal systems to support our growth. In general, we grew our engineering organizations to support product innovation, expand and improve our product portfolio and address growth opportunities in NGN bandwidth and features for our service provider and enterprise customers. Research and development expenses increased $123.0 million, or 3.5 percentage points of net revenues, in 2006 over 2005 as a result of our focus on the development of a broader portfolio of networking products. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases in personnel related expenses, depreciation, facility related expenses, engineering and testing expenses, outside service expenses and equipment related expenses. The increases in personnel related expenses in 2006 were primarily due to additional hires in the engineering organization across the Infrastructure and SLT segments. Headcount increased 19% from 1,736 individuals to 2,070 individuals during 2006. The headcount increase was attributable to product innovation efforts in areas including router security and integration in order to capture potential future NGN infrastructure growth and other opportunities in the enterprise and the service provider markets. To a lesser extent, the increases in personnel expenses were attributable to merit based salary increases beginning in April 2006. Facility, engineering and testing expense increased in 2006 to support our product innovation efforts. Outside service expenses increased in 2006 primarily due to additional consulting projects on developing future product roadmaps. The increase in stock compensation expense in research and development expenses from 2005 to 2006 of $24.0 million was primarily due to the impact of adopting FAS 123R in 2006. Our investment and expansion on our global research and development efforts were primarily in China and India. We plan to increase our investment in research and development during 2008, compared to 2007, to further advance our competitive advantage. As a percentage of net revenues, we anticipate our research and development spending will decrease slightly in 2008. Sales and Marketing Expenses Sales and marketing expenses include costs for promoting our products and services, demonstration equipment and advertisements. These costs vary quarter to quarter depending on revenues, product launches and marketing initiatives. We have an extensive distribution channel in place that we use to target new customers and increase sales. We have made substantial investments in our distribution channel during 2007, 2006 and 2005. Sales and marketing expenses increased $108.7 million, or 19%, to $666.7 million and represented 23.5% of total net revenues in 2007, compared to 24.2% in 2006. As a percentage of net revenue, sales and marketing expenses decreased slightly in 2007 due to our focus on increasing our operating margin and the efficiency of our sales activities. The increases in absolute dollars were primarily headcount related increases. Sales and marketing related headcount increased 272 employees, or 17%, in 2007 to 1,863 as of December 31, 2007 as we hired additional personnel across our Infrastructure and SLT organizations to support the larger product portfolio and to expand our presence in the enterprise marketplace. In addition, commission expenses increased primarily as a result of strong revenue growth. In 2007, we also increased consulting expenses to support our sales and marketing initiatives. Likewise our need and expenses for demonstration equipment has grown as we seek to capture new markets and release new products. As the sales and marketing organization grows, we have also grown our information technology and facilities to these organizations, accounting for the increases of related expense allocations in 2007 over 2006. 46 Table of Contents Sales and marketing expenses increased $116.4 million, or 26%, to $558.0 million in 2006 compared to 2005 and increased as a percent of total net revenues. The increases were primarily due to increases in personnel related expenses, facility related expenses, travel expenses, marketing related activities, and equipment related expenses. Personnel related expenses increased in 2006 primarily due to additional hires to support the expansion of our distribution channels and customer base, as well as to support the larger portfolio of products. In particular, we expanded our enterprise sales force, and targeted key growth areas such as China, the Middle East and India. We added 171 individuals to our sales and marketing function during 2006. Travel expense increased in 2006 due primarily to increased headcount and more activity in emerging markets. Marketing related activities increased primarily as a result of specific activities designed to expand and improve our brand recognition, support of our distribution channels, introduction of new products, targeted solution value propositions and increase awareness of our existing products to a broader range of customers. Equipment related expenses increased in 2006 due to the introduction of new products. The increase in stock compensation expenses in sales and marketing from 2005 to 2006 of $24.5 million was primarily due to the impact of adopting FAS 123R in 2006. We plan to continue our investment in sales and marketing activities in both direct and channel sales as well as our service provider and enterprise focus. We anticipate our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars but decrease as a percentage of net revenues in 2008. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses include professional fees, bad debt provisions and other corporate expenses. Professional fees include legal, audit, tax, accounting and certain corporate strategic services. General and administrative expenses increased $19.3 million, or 20%, and represented 4.1% of total net revenues in 2007, compared to 4.2% in 2006. As a percentage of net revenue, general and administrative expenses slightly decreased in 2007 due to our focus on increasing our operating margin. The increases in absolute dollars were primarily due to increases in personnel related expenses and outside professional services. Employee related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, stock based compensation, and fringe benefits expenses, increased in 2007 over 2006, as headcount increased by 56 employees, or 24%, in 2007 to 291 employees as of December 31, 2007. The headcount increases were primarily in the finance and human resources organizations as we expanded our organization infrastructure in lower cost regions, improved internal processes and continued our initiatives to update our information systems. Outside services increased $4.5 million in 2007, compared to 2006, as we invested in designing a more efficient organizational structure and improving our internal systems. Such increases were offset by the decreases in accounting and legal fees of $1.5 million for 2007, compared to 2006. Consistent with other areas of our organization, facilities and information technology allocations increased in order to support these initiatives and the growth of our business. General and administrative expenses increased $22.1 million, or 29%, in 2006 compared to 2005. As a percentage of net revenues, general and administrative expenses increased slightly from 3.6% in 2005 to 4.2% in 2006. The increases were driven by increases in personnel related expenses and other related expenses. General and administrative world wide headcount increased 11%, or 24 individuals, during 2006, to support the overall growth in the business. Bad debt expense increased in 2006 primarily due to a bad debt expense benefit in 2005. Facility and IT related allocation expense increased as a result of our personnel growth and development of our systems infrastructure. The increase of general and administrative related stock compensation expense from 2005 to 2006 of $11.8 million was primarily due to the impact of adopting FAS 123R in 2006. We anticipate our general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars but decrease as a percentage of net revenues in 2008. Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets Amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased $5.9 million due to purchased intangible assets reaching the end of the amortization period during 2007 as compared to 2006. Amortization of purchased intangible assets increased $6.6 million in 2006, compared to 2005, as a result of recognizing a full year of amortization associated with the five acquisitions completed in 2005. See Note 3 in Item 8 for more information on our purchased intangible assets. 47 Table of Contents Impairment of Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets We had no impairment against our goodwill or intangible assets in 2007. Impairment charges increased by $1,277.5 million in 2006, compared to 2005, as a result of the impairment of both goodwill and purchased intangible assets during 2006. Due primarily to the decline in the Companys market capitalization that occurred over a period of approximately six months prior to the impairment review and, to a lesser extent, to a decrease in the forecasted future cash flows used in the income approach, we evaluated the carrying value of our goodwill and reduced the goodwill within the SLT segment by $1,280.0 million. In addition, we recorded a $3.4 million impairment expense pertaining to a write down of intangible assets as a result of a decrease in forecasted revenue for the SBC stand alone products during the second quarter of 2006. In 2005, we wrote down $5.9 million of purchased intangible assets acquired from Kagoor Networks, Inc. (Kagoor). See Note 3 in Item 8 for more information on our impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets. In Process Research and Development We had no in process research and development (IPRD) charges in 2007 and 2006. In 2005, a total of $11.0 million was charged to IPRD expense in connection with three of our five acquisitions during the year. Of the total Funk purchase price, $5.3 million was allocated to IPRD. Of the total Peribit purchase price, $3.8 million was allocated to IPRD. Of the total Kagoor purchase price, $1.9 million was allocated to IPRD. None of the Acorn Packet Solutions, Inc. (Acorn) or Redline Networks, Inc. (Redline) purchase prices were allocated to IPRD. Projects that qualify as IPRD represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and which have no alternative future use. Technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to a beta phase working prototype in which there is no remaining risk relating to the development. At the time of acquisition, Funk, Peribit, and Kagoor had multiple IPRD efforts under way for certain current and future product lines. For Funk, these efforts included development of new versions for the Steel Belted Radius (SBR), SBR High Availability (HA), and Mobile IP Module (MIM) II products all related to the Radius product offering. IPRD as of the acquisition date also included development of new versions for Endpoint Assurance, Proxy (Remote Control), and Odyssey product families. At the time of the Funk acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over the next four months at an estimated cost of approximately $0.9 million. These development efforts had been completed as of December 31, 2007. For Peribit, these efforts included the development of next versions of software for the Sequence Reducer (SR) family, Sequence Mirror (SM) family, the Central Management System (CMS) products, as well as a hardware program for both the SR and SM families. At the time of the Peribit acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over the next twelve months at an estimated cost of approximately $2.3 million. These development efforts had been completed as of December 31, 2007. For Kagoor, these efforts included a variety of signaling protocols and next generation products and operating systems. At the time of the Kagoor acquisition, it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over the next eight months at an estimated cost of approximately $0.8 million. These development efforts had been completed as of December 31, 2007. Other Charges, Net Other charges are summarized as follows: Restructuring and Acquisition Related Reserves. In 2007, we recorded net restructuring and acquisition related charges of $0.7 million, of which $1.1 million pertained to bonus accruals associated with past acquisitions, partially offset by a benefit of $0.4 million pertaining to net restructuring adjustments. We recorded net restructuring and acquisition related bonus expenses of $5.9 million in 2006, of which $5.6 million was due to bonus accruals associated with the Funk and Acorn acquisitions and $0.3 million was due to net restructuring related charges, including $0.7 million in restructuring charges associated with 48 Table of Contents the initiation of a restructuring plan which focused on some product development costs reductions and the discontinuation of our SBC product. The $6.5 million restructuring and acquisition related benefit in 2005 primarily consisted of $6.9 million in adjustments related to our restructuring accrual when we re occupied a portion of the former NetScreen facility that was previously included in this acquisition related restructuring reserve, partially offset by a $0.3 million bonus and earn out accrual related to the Funk and Acorn acquisitions. Stock Option Investigation Costs. We recorded expenses of $6.0 million and $20.5 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, relating to professional fees and other costs in connection with our stock option investigation. There were no such charges in 2005. Stock Option Amendment and Tax Related Charges. We recorded $8.0 million and $10.1 million in operating expense during 2007 and 2006, respectively, in relation to the amendment of stock options and to the payment of certain taxes and penalties associated with stock option exercises by employees. There were no such charges in 2005. Net Settlement Gain. We recognized a net legal settlement gain of $5.3 million in 2007 in connection with cash settlement proceeds of $6.2 million, net of the $0.9 million legal expense related to direct transaction costs incurred in the third quarter of 2007. Other Income and Expenses Interest and Other Income, Interest and Other Expense, Gain on Minority Equity Investment, and Income Tax Provision The following table highlights other income, other expenses and income tax provision for the indicated periods (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 $ Change % Change 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Interest and other income, net $ 96.8 $ 100.7 $ (3.9 ) (4 )% $ 100.7 $ 55.2 $ 45.5 82 % Percentage of net revenues 3.4 % 4.4 % 4.4 % 2.7 % Gain on and (write down of) investments, net 6.7 6.7 100 % 1.3 (1.3 ) (100 )% Percentage of net revenues 0.2 % 0.1 % Income tax provision 149.8 104.4 45.4 43 % 104.4 146.8 (42.4 ) (29 )% Percentage of net revenues 5.3 % 4.5 % 4.5 % 7.1 % Interest and Other Income, Net Net interest and other income decreased $3.9 million, or 4%, in 2007 compared to 2006. This decrease was due to decreases in interest income resulting from a lower cash, cash equivalents and investment balance attributable to our funding of our repurchase of approximately $1.6 billion of our common stock during the first and second quarters of 2007. Partially offsetting the decreases was the higher interest yield combined with a higher average cash, cash equivalents and investment balances particularly in the beginning of 2007, primarily due to higher positive cash flows from operations compared to 2006. Interest and other expenses slightly increased in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to costs associated with our distributor financing program. Other interest and expenses include short term debt expenses, debt issuance cost amortization, foreign exchange losses and other expenses such as bank fees. Net interest and other income increased $45.5 million in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to a $45.8 million increase in interest income from 2005 to 2006 as a result of higher cash, cash equivalents and investment balances and an increase in rates of return realized from our investments throughout 2006. Also, interest and other expense decreased $0.3 million from 2005 and 2006 primarily due to lower portfolio management fees. 49 Table of Contents Gain on and (Write Down of) Investments, Net In June 2007, one of the companies in which we had a minority equity investment completed an initial public offering (IPO). As a result, we realized a gain of $6.7 million during 2007 based upon the difference between the market value of our investment at the time of the IPO and our cost basis. During 2006, none of our investments had any gain or loss. In 2005, we recorded a gain of $1.7 million in connection with a business combination transaction of a privately held company in our investment portfolio. Our cost basis of this equity investment was $1.0 million. We have certain minority equity investments in privately held companies that are carried at cost, adjusted for any impairment, as we do not have a controlling interest and do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over these companies. In addition, during 2005, we wrote down these investments by $0.4 million for changes in market value that we believed were other than temporary. Income Tax Provision Provision for income taxes increased to $149.8 million in 2007 from $104.4 million in 2006. The 2007 effective rate was 29.3% and differs from the federal statutory rate of 35.0% primarily due to the benefit of income in foreign jurisdictions which is subject to lower rates and research and development credits in the United States. Provision for income taxes decreased to $104.4 million in 2006 from $146.8 million in 2005. The 2006 effective rate was (11.6%) and differs from the federal statutory rate of 35.0% primarily due to the inability to benefit from a substantial portion of the goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2006. The 2005 effective rate was 29.5% and differs from the federal statutory rate of 35.0% due primarily to the benefit of tax credits, income in foreign jurisdictions taxed at lower rates and a reduction in deferred tax liabilities related to the repatriation in 2005 of $225.0 million under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by approximately $9.5 million for 2007, of which $8.4 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. Interest and penalties accrued for the same period were approximately $1.7 million. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months due to audit examinations. However, an estimate of the range of possible change cannot be made at this time due to the high uncertainty of the resolution of and or closure on open audits. We are currently under examination by the IRS for the 2004 tax year and by the German tax authorities for the 2005 tax year. Additionally, we have not reached a final resolution with the IRS on an adjustment it proposed for the 1999 and 2000 tax years. We are not under examination by any other major jurisdictions in which the Company files its income tax returns as of December 31, 2007. It is possible that the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months. However, an estimate of the range of possible change cannot be made at this time. We have provided for uncertain tax positions that require a FIN 48 liability. Additional details related to our income tax provision can be found in Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment Information A description of the products and services for each segment can be found in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We began to track financial information by our three segments in 2005 as our management structure and responsibilities began to measure the business based on management operating income (loss). A description of the measures included in management operating income (loss) can also be found in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We have included segment financial data for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 for comparative purposes. 50 Table of Contents Financial information for each segment used by management to make financial decisions and allocate resources is as follows (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 $ Change % Change 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Net revenues: Infrastructure $ 1,753.2 $ 1,413.4 $ 339.8 24 % $ 1,413.4 $ 1,371.6 $ 41.8 3 % Service Layer Technologies 573.8 479.9 93.9 20 % 479.9 399.4 80.5 20 % Service 509.1 410.3 98.8 24 % 410.3 293.0 117.3 40 % Total net revenues $ 2,836.1 $ 2,303.6 $ 532.5 23 % $ 2,303.6 $ 2,064.0 $ 239.6 12 % Management operating income (loss)(1): Infrastructure $ 495.5 $ 420.9 $ 74.6 18 % $ 420.9 $ 489.2 $ (68.3 ) (14 )% Service Layer Technologies (18.3 ) (11.3 ) (7.0 ) (62 )% (11.3 ) 10.4 (21.7 ) (209 )% Service 126.4 101.5 24.9 25 % 101.5 72.2 29.3 41 % Total management operating income 603.6 511.1 92.5 18 % 511.1 571.8 (60.7 ) (11 )% Amortization of purchased intangible assets (91.4 ) (97.3 ) 5.9 (6 )% (97.3 ) (85.2 ) (12.1 ) 14 % Stock based compensation expense (88.0 ) (87.6 ) (0.4 ) (87.6 ) (22.3 ) (65.3 ) N/M Stock based compensation related payroll tax (7.7 ) (2.7 ) (5.0 ) 185 % (2.7 ) (2.9 ) 0.2 (10 )% Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets (1,283.4 ) 1,283.4 (100 )% (1,283.4 ) (5.9 ) (1,277.5 ) N/M In process research and development (11.0 ) 11.0 (100 )% Other expense, net(2) (9.4 ) (37.9 ) 28.5 (75 )% (37.9 ) (3.5 ) (34.4 ) N/M Total operating income (loss) 407.1 (997.8 ) 1,404.9 141 % (997.8 ) 441.0 (1,438.8 ) N/M Interest and other income, net 96.8 100.7 (3.9 ) (4 )% 100.7 55.2 45.5 82 % Gain on (write down of) investments, net 6.7 6.7 100 % 1.3 (1.3 ) (100 )% Income (loss) before income taxes $ 510.6 $ (897.1 ) $ 1,407.7 157 % $ (897.1 ) $ 497.5 $ (1,394.6 ) N/M (1) Prior year information has been reclassified to conform to our current year presentation.

Other expense, net, for 2005 included charges such as restructuring, acquisition related charges and patent related charges. 51 Table of Contents The following table shows financial information for each segment as a percentage of total net revenues: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Net revenues: Infrastructure 61.8 % 61.4 % 66.5 % Service Layer Technologies 20.2 % 20.8 % 19.3 % Service 18.0 % 17.8 % 14.2 % Total net revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Management operating income (loss): Infrastructure 17.4 % 18.3 % 23.7 % Service Layer Technologies (0.6 )% (0.5 )% 0.5 % Service 4.5 % 4.4 % 3.5 % Total management operating income 21.3 % 22.2 % 27.7 % Amortization of purchased intangible assets (3.2 )% (4.2 )% (4.1 )% Stock based compensation expense (3.1 )% (3.8 )% (1.1 )% Stock based compensation related payroll expense (0.3 )% (0.1 )% (0.1 )% Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets (55.7 )% (0.3 )% In process research and development (0.6 )% Other expense, net (0.3 )% (1.7 )% (0.1 )% Total operating income (loss) 14.4 % (43.3 )% 21.4 % Interest and other income, net 3.4 % 4.4 % 2.7 % Gain on minority equity investment 0.2 % Income (loss) before income taxes 18.0 % (38.9 )% 24.1 % Infrastructure Operating Segment An analysis of the change in revenue for the Infrastructure segment, and the change in units, can be found above in the section titled Net Revenues. Infrastructure management operating income increased $74.6 million, or 18%, from 2006 to $495.5 million in 2007 due to revenue growth outpacing expense growth. Our increase in revenue was partially offset by our continued investments in research and development efforts as we seek to continue our innovation of products and expand our Infrastructure product portfolio. We also allocate sales and marketing, general and administrative, as well as facility and information technology expenses to the Infrastructure segment generally based on headcount and revenue. In 2007, our sales and marketing expenses decreased slightly as a percentage of net revenues but increased in absolute dollars as we increased our efforts to reach enterprise and service provider customers. We will continue to make these investments to expand our product features and functionality based upon the trends in the market place. Infrastructure management operating income decreased $68.3 million, or 14%, from 2005 to $420.9 million in 2006 primarily due to higher personnel related costs associated with our investments in product innovation for next generation core and edge infrastructure products as well as increased operating expenses associated with marketing related efforts and improvements to our internal infrastructure, partially offset by savings in sales expense during 2006 as we increasingly leveraged our existing distribution channel. SLT Operating Segment An analysis of the change in revenue for the SLT segment, and the change in units, can be found in the section titled Net Revenues. 52 Table of Contents SLT management operating loss increased $7.0 million, or 62%, from 2006 to $18.3 million in 2007 due to product mix and increases in manufacturing related costs. The loss was primarily due to our effort to build a foundation to help enable future SLT revenue growth and due to slight decreases in the SLT product gross margins. The increase in SLT operating expenses was due in large part to our increased allocated expenses to the SLT segment from both information technology investments and the higher variable compensation expenses associated with company wide revenue growth. Additionally, we strategically invested in our research and development efforts to develop technologies and products for the JUNOS platform. In an effort to control costs, we have moved a significant portion of the SLT development organization to lower cost regions while expanding our product portfolio. SLT management operating loss was also impacted by continued investments in our sales and distribution channels. We allocate sales and marketing, general and administrative, as well as facility and information technology expenses to the SLT segment generally based on revenue and headcount. In the third quarter of 2007, we increased our allocation of such expenses to the SLT segment, compared to the same period in 2006, primarily due to information technology investments and the higher variable compensation expenses associated with company wide revenue increases. SLT gross margin decreased slightly in 2007, as compared to 2006, due to higher manufacturing costs associated with newer and more complex products. Such higher manufacturing costs were partially offset as we realized the benefit of our cost reduction efforts of moving more manufacturing to lower cost regions. The increases in SLT operating expenses were partially offset by our revenue growth especially in the fourth quarter of 2007 due to customers demands for security products, particularly Firewall, and due to typical quarterly seasonality. We generally experienced quarterly seasonality and fluctuations in the demand for our SLT products, particularly in the fourth quarter, which may result in greater variations in our quarterly operating results. The SLT segment incurred a management operating loss of $11.3 million in 2006, compared to the management operating income of $10.4 million in 2005, due primarily to higher product and personnel related costs, partially offset by higher SLT net revenues and gross margin. Increases in personnel related costs were primarily related to headcount growth in order to support product innovation, new products sales and a larger customer base. We made a strategic decision to invest more into the enterprise and SLT markets to drive increased revenues and SLT productivity in the future. Service Operating Segment An analysis of the change in revenue for the Service segment can be found above in the section titled Net Revenue. Service management operating income increased $24.9 million, or 25%, from 2006 to $126.4 million in 2007 by achieving economies of scale and cost control initiatives. Revenue growth surpassed cost of service expense growth in 2007 primarily due to our growth in installed base of equipment being serviced. We also increased our service offerings and customer service infrastructure. Our Service gross margin slightly decreased from 2006 to 2007 as we increased our headcount to build our global customer service and professional service organizations. We expanded our customer service center in both North America and India as well as increased our resources for supporting network build outs and deployments by our customers. Service management operating income was also impacted by sales and marketing, general and administrative expenses as well as facilities and information systems management allocations to the service segment. Service gross margin percentages as well as Service management operating income increased from 2005 to 2006 due primarily to improved economies of scale achieved by faster revenue growth through the Infrastructure products and the SLT products relative to the increases in operating costs. In absolute dollars, employee related expenses increased in 2006 as a result of increased service related headcount from 476 to 611 individuals. Expenses associated with spare components also increased in 2006 to support increased demands driven by additional service contracts as a result of our growing installed base. Stock Based Compensation and Related Payroll Taxes Stock based compensation expense increased by $0.4 million in 2007 as compared to 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to new stock options and RSU grants, partially offset by the lower stock option expense in 2007 as a result of the acceleration of the vesting of certain unvested and out of the money stock options 53 Table of Contents completed in December 2005 (2005 stock option vesting acceleration). Stock based compensation related payroll tax expense increased $5.0 million in 2007. These expenses represent employment taxes we incurred in connection with our employee stock programs. Changes in such expenses are primarily attributable to the timing of the stock options exercises by our employees. We experienced a considerable increase in these expenses due to the increase in our share price occurring in 2007. In contrast, we had restrictions on stock option exercises during 2006. Stock based compensation expense increased by $65.3 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to the adoption of FAS 123R. Stock based compensation related payroll tax expense decreased $0.2 million in 2006, compared to 2005 primarily due to restrictions on stock option exercises in 2006 as a result of our delayed periodic filings with the SEC. In Process Research and Development There were no IPRD charges in 2007 and 2006. We recognized IPRD charges of $11.0 million 2005 in connection with the acquisitions completed during the year. Restructuring Charges in Cost of Product Revenues There was no restructuring charges included in cost of product revenues during 2007 and 2005. We recognized restructuring charges in cost of product revenues of $1.4 million for 2006 in connection with the restructuring plan implemented during the year. Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets, Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Other Expense, Gain on Investments, and Net Interest and Other Income See Results of Operations section for further information. Key Performance Measures In addition to the financial metrics included in the consolidated financial statements, we use the following key performance measures to assess operating results: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Days sales outstanding (DSO)(a) 42 38 42 Book to bill ratio(b) 1 1 1 (a) Days sales outstanding, or DSO, is calculated as the ratio of ending accounts receivable, net of allowances, divided by average daily net sales for the preceding 90 days. (b) Book to bill ratio represents the ratio of customer orders divided by the sum of product shipments and service invoicing during the respective period. 54 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview We have funded our business by issuing securities and through our operating activities. The following table shows our capital resources (in millions): December 31, December 31, 2007 2006 $ Change % Change Working capital $ 1,175.3 $ 1,759.2 $ (583.9 ) (33 )% Cash and cash equivalents 1,716.1 1,596.3 119.8 8 % Short term investments 240.4 443.9 (203.5 ) (46 )% Long term investments 59.3 574.1 (514.8 ) (90 )% Total cash, cash equivalents and available for sale investments $ 2,015.8 $ 2,614.3 $ (598.5 ) (23 )% The significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, short term investments and accounts receivable, reduced by accounts payable, accrued liabilities, debt and deferred revenue. Working capital decreased $583.9 million from December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2007 primarily due to the decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and available for sale investments balance in the first and second quarters of 2007. Our total cash, cash equivalents, and available for sale investments decreased by $598.5 million during 2007 primarily due to stock repurchases under the 2006 Stock Repurchase Program discussed below. Additionally, because the debt related to our outstanding zero coupon convertible notes is due within one year, we reclassified $399.5 million of debt underlying such notes from long term to short term liabilities and, as a result, further reduced our working capital. In 2007, we generated $786.5 million of cash from operations and $571.8 million from our investing activities. In addition, we received financing cash flows of $355.0 million from common stock issued to our employees through stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases. In 2007, we repurchased 69.4 million shares of our common stock for $1,623.2 million at an average purchase price of $23.37 per share. As of December 31, 2007, our 2006 Stock Repurchase Program had remaining authorized funds of $376.8 million. We may repurchase additional shares opportunistically under this program, subject to a review of circumstances at the time. See Note 15 in Item 8 for discussion of our stock repurchase activity in 2008. In June 2007, we entered into a senior secured margin lending agreement with a third party financial institution for a maximum credit facility of $400.0 million, or 90% of the fair market value of the underlying collateral, to establish a flexible draw down facility to fund additional stock repurchases, as necessary. This credit facility bore a floating interest rate equal to the three month USD LIBOR plus 40 basis points per annum and, if utilized, would be secured by our publicly traded fixed income securities portfolio equivalent to 111% of any outstanding balance. This credit facility was terminated on September 26, 2007. We did not utilize this credit facility at any time. Net accounts receivable increased $130.3 million, or 52%, to $379.8 million from December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2007 primarily due to an increase in revenue and shipment linearity. DSO was 42 days as of December 31, 2007 as compared to 38 days as of December 31, 2006. The increase in DSO was primarily a result of shipment linearity and the mix of customers we shipped to in the fourth quarter of 2007. Shipment linearity represents the rate at which products are shipped during a period. Our distributor financing program had minimal impact on DSO during 2007. Approximately $10.0 million of receivables sold under the distributor financing program had not been recognized in net revenues as of December 31, 2007 and therefore such amounts were recorded as debt financing in other accrued liabilities. Deferred revenue increased $127.7 million or 33% to $513.3 million as of December 31, 2007 as compared to December 31, 2006. Product and service deferred revenue increased $43.2 million and $84.5 million, respectively, in 2007. Our product deferred revenue increased due to increases in the amount of product shipments not having met revenue recognition criteria and service deferred revenue increased due to an increase in the installed base of equipment under service contract. 55 Table of Contents Liquidity and capital resources may also be impacted by acquisitions and investments in strategic relationships we may make in the networking equipment and information security markets. If we were to repurchase additional shares of our common stock under our 2006 Stock Repurchase Program, our liquidity may be impacted. Additionally, a portion of our cash and investment balance is held overseas and may be subject to U.S. taxes if repatriated. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short term and long term investments, together with cash generated from operations as well as cash generated from the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan will be sufficient to fund our operations, repayment of outstanding debt, and growth. We believe our working capital is sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for capital expenditures, commitments, repurchases of our common stock, and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations through at least the next 12 months. However, our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending on many factors, including: the overall levels of sales of our products and gross profit margins; our business, product, capital expenditure and research and development plans; the market acceptance of our products; repurchases of our common stock; issuance and repayment of debt; litigation expenses, settlements and judgments; volume price discounts and customer rebates; the levels of accounts receivable that we maintain; acquisitions of other businesses, assets, products or technologies; changes in our compensation policies; capital improvements for new and existing facilities; technological advances; our competitors responses to our products; our relationships with suppliers and customers; expenses related to our future restructuring plans, if any; tax expense associated with stock based awards; issuance of stock based awards and the related payment in cash for withholding taxes in the current year and possibly during future years; the level of exercises of stock options and stock purchases under our equity incentive plans; and general economic conditions and specific conditions in our industry and markets, including the effects of international conflicts and related uncertainties. Cash Requirements and Contractual Obligations Our principal commitments primarily consist of obligations outstanding under the Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2008 (Senior Notes), operating leases, purchase commitments, tax liabilities and other contractual obligations. The following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of December 31, 56 Table of Contents 2007 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in millions): Less than More than Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Other Operating leases, net of committed subleases(a) $ 221.3 $ 49.0 $ 117.2 $ 43.6 $ 11.5 $ Senior Notes(b) 399.5 399.5 Purchase commitments(c) 102.8 102.8 Tax liabilities(d) 41.5 41.5 Other contractual obligations(e) 44.4 21.9 22.5 Total $ 809.5 $ 573.2 $ 139.7 $ 43.6 $ 11.5 $ 41.5 (a) Our contractual obligations under operating leases primarily relate to our leased facilities under our non cancelable operating leases. Rent payments are allocated to costs and operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. We occupy approximately 1.8 million square feet world wide under operating leases. The majority of our office space is in North America, including our corporate headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. Our longest lease expires in May 2016. (b) Our principal commitment as of December 31, 2007 was our outstanding Senior Notes due June 15, 2008. The Senior Notes were issued in June 2003 and are senior unsecured obligations, rank on parity in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured debt, and rank senior to all of our existing and future debt that expressly provides that it is subordinated to the notes. The Senior Notes bear no interest, but are convertible into shares of our common stock, subject to certain conditions, at any time prior to maturity or their prior repurchase by Juniper Networks. The conversion rate is 49.6512 shares per each $1,000 principal amount of convertible notes, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. This is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $20.14 per share. The carrying value of the Senior Notes as of December 31, 2007 was $399.5 million, which was included in current liabilities as the debt is due in less than one year. (c) In order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply, our contract manufacturers place non cancelable, non returnable (NCNR) orders for components based on our build forecasts. As of December 31, 2007, there were NCNR component orders placed by our contract manufacturers with a value of $102.8 million. The contract manufacturers use the components to build products based on our forecasts and on purchase orders we have received from our customers. Generally, we do not own the components and title to the products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon delivery at a designated shipment location. If the components go unused or the products go unsold for specified periods of time, we may incur carrying charges or obsolete materials charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders. As of December 31, 2007, we had accrued $22.2 million based on our estimate of such charges. (d) Tax liabilities include the long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet for unrecognized tax positions. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. (e) Other contractual obligations consist of the escrow amount of $2.2 million and bonus accrual of $0.7 million in connection with past acquisitions, a software subscription requiring payments of $5.0 million in both January 2008 and January 2009 and a joint development agreement requiring quarterly payments of $3.5 million through January 2010. 57 Table of Contents Summary of Cash Flows Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $786.5 million, $755.6 million, and $642.9 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The cash provided by operating activities for each period was due to our net income (loss) adjusted by: Non cash charges of $257.5 million, $1,536.4 million, and $307.4 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, primarily related to depreciation and amortization expenses, stock based compensation, tax benefit of employee stock option plans, in process research and development from acquisitions, debt issuance costs, restructuring expense, and impairment charges. Non cash charges in 2007 and 2006 were reduced by the excess tax benefit from stock based compensation of $19.7 million and $9.7 million, respectively, and a gain on a minority equity investment of $6.7 million. Non cash charges in 2006 also included charges of $1,283.4 million related to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. In 2005 non cash charges included $128.1 million of tax benefit from employee stock options. Beginning in 2006, tax benefit from employee stock options, in accordance with FAS 123R, are no longer included in cash flows from operations but rather are included in financing activities. Non cash charges in 2005 also included an in process research and development charge, a benefit from the reversal of NetScreens acquisition related liabilities and a loss due to the impairment of an equity investment, partially offset by gains associated with available for sale investments. Net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $168.2 million, $220.6 million, and $(15.1) million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, were generally generated in the normal course of business. These changes are highlighted as follows: Net cash increases in 2007 were primarily attributable to increases in accounts payable of $34.9 million, an increase in accrued compensation of $48.3 million, an increase in taxes payable of $71.4 million and an increase in deferred revenue of $127.7 million. The increase in accounts payable was due to the timing of payments to contract manufacturers and the growth of our business. The increase in accrued compensation was due to an increase in headcount, an increase in stock option exercises and the removal of the suspension on employee purchases of shares under ESPP. The increase in taxes payable was due to the increase in the tax provision, movement of deferred tax assets, and timing of payments. The increase in deferred revenue was due to the growing installed base and customer payments in advance of product acceptance. In addition, these increases in cash flows from operations were partially offset by a negative cash flow of $120.9 million primarily due to an increase in net accounts receivable in 2007, which was primarily due to the timing of shipments and the mix of customers who purchased our products, as we shipped a larger amount of products late in the fourth quarter of 2007 and such invoices would not come due until after December 31, 2007. Net cash increases in 2006 were primarily attributable to increases in deferred revenue of $132.8 million due to the growing installed base and customer payments in advance of product acceptance. The increase in operating cash flows was also due to the decreases in accounts receivable of $20.7 million and aggregate decreases in prepaid expenses, other current assets and other long term assets of $23.0 million. Accounts payable increased $13.6 million and accrued compensation increased $12.7 million primarily due to the costs of headcount increases and related employee bonuses. Changes in taxes payable and other accrued liabilities contributed $18.3 million to cash flows from operations in 2006. Net cash used in 2005 from changes was primarily attributable to increases in net accounts receivable of $68.1 million and decreases in other accrued liabilities of $100.7 million and accrued warranty of $3.7 million, partially offset by decreases in the prepaid expenses, other current assets and other long term assets accounts of $5.3 million, increases in income taxes payable of $26.6 million, increases in deferred revenue of $64.3 million, increases in accounts payable of $50.3 million and increases in accrued compensation of $10.9 million. 58 Table of Contents Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities was $571.8 million and $11.9 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities was $583.7 million for 2005. Investing activities primarily included the purchases and sale or maturities of available for sale securities, the purchase and sale of equity investments, net cash used in acquisitions and capital expenditures. Net sales and maturities of investments in available for sale securities were $1,029.1 million in 2007, compared to net sales and maturities of $632.1 million for 2006, as we used cash to fund our stock repurchase program described under the financing activities section below. Purchases of available for sale securities used $298.6 million in 2007 compared to $516.1 million in 2006 primarily due to the funding of our stock repurchase program and our investment strategy during 2007. Positive net cash flows of $115.9 million generated from the sales, maturities and purchases of available for sale securities in 2006 was primarily due to the increased cash and cash equivalent holdings as a result of higher short term interest rates. Purchases and sales or maturities of available for sale securities used net cash of $131.0 million in 2005. Capital expenditures increased $44.8 million to $146.9 million in 2007 and $3.9 million to $102.1 million in 2006 mainly to support new product developments and overseas expansions. Capital expenditures of $98.2 million in 2005 mainly used in support of new product developments, overseas expansions and business acquisitions. Cash flows related to restricted cash decreased by $27.9 million, from a cash inflow of $20.5 million in 2006 to a cash outflow of $7.4 million in 2007, primarily due to the funding to the DO insurance trust to increase coverage due to the growth of our company. In 2005, we used cash of $309.9 million for the 2005 acquisitions, $34.8 million for restricted cash funding to escrow accounts in relation to the 2005 acquisitions, and $9.8 million for minority equity investment. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $1,238.5 million and $89.6 million for 2007 and 2006 respectively. In 2007 we repurchased 69.4 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $23.37 per share, or a total of $1,623.2 million. In 2006, we repurchased 10.1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $18.51 per share, or a total of $186.4 million. In addition, cash was provided during both periods from the issuance of common stock related to employee option exercises and stock purchase plans for a total of $355.0 million and $87.1 million during 2007 and 2006, respectively. In 2007 and 2006, tax benefits of $19.7 million and $9.7 million, respectively, from tax deductions in excess of the expense recognized for employee stock options was presented as financing cash flows due to the adoption of FAS 123R, beginning on January 1, 2006. Tax deductions in excess of the expense recognized for employee stock options were included in operating cash flows in 2005 before the adoption of FAS 123R. Approximately $10.0 million of receivables sold under our distributor financing program had not been recognized as revenue as of December 31, 2007 and therefore such amounts were recorded as net borrowings under cash flows from financing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $146.0 million in 2005 primarily due to common stock issued in relation to employee option exercises and purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types and maturities. In addition, a portion of our cash and marketable securities are held in non U.S. domiciled countries. These securities are generally classified as available for sale and, consequently, are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 59 Table of Contents At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings of our investment portfolio. We do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures. The following tables present hypothetical changes in fair value of the financial instruments held at December 31, 2007 and 2006 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates (in millions): Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Fair Value as of Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Rate Decrease of X Basis Points (BPS) December 31, Rate Increase of X BPS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 2007 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS Government treasury and agencies $ 68.4 $ 68.1 $ 67.7 $ 67.4 $ 67.0 $ 66.7 $ 66.3 Corporate bonds and notes 108.3 107.5 106.7 105.9 105.1 104.3 103.5 Other 370.3 370.1 370.0 369.9 369.7 369.6 369.5 Total $ 547.0 $ 545.7 $ 544.4 $ 543.2 $ 541.8 $ 540.6 $ 539.3 Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Fair Value as of Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Rate Decrease of X Basis Points (BPS) December 31, Rate Increase of X BPS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 2006 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS Government treasury and agencies $ 297.5 $ 296.0 $ 294.5 $ 293.0 $ 291.6 $ 290.1 $ 288.6 Corporate bonds and notes 520.4 517.7 515.0 512.3 509.6 506.8 504.1 Asset backed securities and other 333.9 333.4 332.9 332.4 331.9 331.4 331.0 Total $ 1,151.8 $ 1,147.1 $ 1,142.4 $ 1,137.7 $ 1,133.1 $ 1,128.3 $ 1,123.7 These instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading. The modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (BPS), 100 BPS and 150 BPS, which are representative of the historical movements in the Federal Funds Rate. Foreign Currency Risk and Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts Periodically, we use derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate transaction gains and losses generated by certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. These derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other income (expense) in the same period as the changes in the fair value from the re measurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. These foreign exchange contracts have maturities between one and two months. Our sales and costs of revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Our operating expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the British Pound, the Euro, Indian Rupee, and Japanese Yen. Periodically, we use foreign currency forward and or option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to operating expenses. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of less than one year. The effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and, upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction, is subsequently reclassified into the consolidated statements of operations line item to which the hedged transaction relates. We record any ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments, which was immaterial during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, in other income (expense) on our consolidated statements of operations. The increase in operating expenses including research and development, sales and marketing, as well as general and administrative expenses, due to foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, was approximately 2% in 2007. 60 Table of Contents Equity Price Risk Our portfolio of publicly traded equity securities is inherently exposed to equity price risk as the stock market fluctuates. We monitor our equity investments for impairment on a periodic basis. In the event that the carrying value of the equity investments exceeds its fair value, and we determine the decline in value to be other than temporary, we reduce the carrying value to its current fair value. We do not purchase our equity securities with the intent to use them for trading or speculative purposes. The aggregate fair value of our marketable equity securities was $8.6 million and $0.8 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. A hypothetical 30% adverse change in the stock prices of our portfolio of publicly traded equity securities would result in an immaterial loss. In addition to publicly traded securities, we have also invested in privately held companies. These investments are carried at cost. The aggregate cost of our investments in privately held companies was $23.3 million and $20.4 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 61 Table of Contents
