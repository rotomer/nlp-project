ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This Annual Report on Form 10 K (Report), including the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward looking statements regarding future events and the future results of Juniper Networks, Inc. (the Company) that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the industry in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management. Words such as expects, anticipates, targets, goals, projects, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. These forward looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this Report under the section entitled Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I and elsewhere, and in other reports we file with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Form 10 Q. While forward looking statements are our best prediction at the time that they are made, you should not rely on them. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason. The following discussion is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In the course of operating our business, we routinely make decisions as to the timing of the payment of invoices, the collection of receivables, the manufacturing, and shipment of products, the fulfillment of orders, the purchase of supplies, and the building of inventory and spare parts, among other matters. Each of these decisions has some impact on the financial results for any given period. In making these decisions, we consider various factors including contractual obligations, customer satisfaction, competition, internal and external financial targets and expectations, and financial planning objectives. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and related disclosure of contingencies. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to sales returns, pricing credits, warranty costs, allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long term assets, especially goodwill and intangible assets, contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges, assumptions used in the valuation of stock based compensation, and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. To aid in understanding our operating results for the periods covered by this report, we have provided an executive overview and a summary of the significant events that affected the most recent fiscal year and a discussion of the nature of our operating expenses. These sections should be read in conjunction with the more detailed 30 Table of Contents discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in this Item 7, our Risk Factors section included in Item 1A of Part I, and our audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in Item 8 of Part II of this report. Executive Overview Our 2008 performance was the result of a combination of strong market demand for networking and security products as well as our focused execution and market share gains. In addition, we began shipment of several new products, which contributed to our revenue growth during the year. While revenue growth was substantial, towards the end of 2008 worldwide economic conditions, in particular the slowdown in the U.S., led to slowing rates of growth and reduced our visibility into future periods. During 2008, we continued implementation of a series of operational excellence initiatives. These initiatives are intended to strengthen the management systems and processes throughout our organization to support our growth and to improve operational efficiency and contain costs in the face of difficult economic and market conditions. 2008 2007 $ Change % Change (In millions, except per share amounts and percentages) Net revenues $ 3,572.4 $ 2,836.1 $ 736.3 26 % Operating income $ 695.0 $ 407.1 $ 287.9 71 % Percentage of net revenues 19.5 % 14.4 % Net income $ 511.7 $ 360.8 $ 150.9 42 % Percentage of net revenues 14.3 % 12.7 % Net income per share: Basic $ 0.96 $ 0.67 $ 0.29 43 % Diluted $ 0.93 $ 0.62 $ 0.31 50 % Net Revenues: Our net revenues increased in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to the growing acceptance of our router and firewall products and services in the service provider and enterprise markets. We experienced growth in both product and service revenues, which represented 81.5% and 18.5%, respectively, of our total net revenues in 2008. Product revenues increased $584.0 million, or 25%, to $2,911.0 million in 2008 compared to 2007. Service revenues increased $152.3 million, or 30%, to $661.4 million in 2008 compared to 2007. Net revenues increased in each of our three geographic regions in 2008 compared to 2007. Operating Income: Our operating income as well as operating margin as a percentage of net revenues increased in 2008 compared to 2007. These increases were, in large part, due to the growth in revenues and a decrease in operating expense as a percentage of net revenues, which was attributable to our efforts to better manage expenses and improve efficiencies in 2008 compared to 2007. In our effort to manage our expenses, we expanded our RD headcount in regions with lower operating costs. Net Income and Net Income Per Share: The increase in net income and net income per share in 2008 compared to 2007, is primarily due to the increase in operating income, which resulted from the growth in revenues, and the reduction in operating expense as a percentage of net revenues, which is attributable to a decrease in the amortization of purchased intangible assets and the implementation of certain cost reduction initiatives compared to 2007. The increase in operating income was partially offset by lower net interest and other income primarily due to lower interest rates along with higher income tax expense in 2008. Other Financial Highlights: Total deferred revenue increased $77.0 million in 2008, primarily due to the growth in our installed equipment base for maintenance and customer support contracts. In 2008, we generated a net increase of $303.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, primarily resulting from $875.2 million in cash provided by our operating activities, which was offset by the repurchase of $604.7 million of our common stock. 31 Table of Contents Significant Events Business and Market Environment We design, develop, and sell products and services that together provide our customers with high performance network infrastructure that creates responsive and trusted environments for accelerating the deployment of services and applications over a single IP based network. We serve the high performance networking requirements of global service providers, enterprises, governments, and research and education institutions that view the network as critical to their success. High performance networking is designed to provide fast, reliable, and secure access to applications and services at scale. We offer a high performance network infrastructure that includes IP routing, Ethernet switching, security, and application acceleration solutions, as well as partnerships designed to extend the value of the network and worldwide services and support designed to optimize customer investments. In 2008, we continued to deliver new and innovative, high performance network infrastructure solutions. We entered the enterprise switching market, through the introduction of the EX series, a family of Ethernet switches that leverage the operational simplicity and carrier class reliability of our JUNOS software. We also introduced a new category of extensible networking and security products with our SRX series dynamic services gateways. In addition, we introduced a new family of IDP appliances that deliver up to 10 Gigabits per second real world throughput and performance to enable deployments in the network core, the integration of services, including Firewall and chassis clustering, into JUNOS software for implementation on the J series services router and the Security Threat Response Manager (STRM), a platform capable of providing businesses with a centralized scalable and effective way to log and manage a rapidly evolving threat landscape. We also announced an advanced mobile IP/Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) solution portfolio with the new BX 7000 multi access gateway router for the cell site, M series circuit emulation physical interface cards for the aggregation site, and a suite of software features designed to simplify deployment, provisioning and management of mobile backhaul networks. In addition, we introduced the JCS 1200, a dedicated high performance control plane scaling platform. We also delivered new enhancements to existing solutions to help customers maximize their network infrastructure investments and lower their overall total cost of ownership. We expanded our Network and Security Manager (NSM) to deliver a centralized management solution for routing, security, and switching, enabling customers to consolidate and simplify the management of their network infrastructure. We announced enhancements to our Access Control Solution, to deliver enhanced scalability and performance, with centralized access policy management via NSM, helping customers cost effectively achieve comprehensive network visibility with broad enforcement capabilities. We introduced the next generation of our WXC application acceleration platforms to deliver a more scalable, modular, and cost effective approach to delivering fast and consistent application response across the WAN. In addition, we announced three new line card families for the MX series Ethernet Services Routers. In 2008, the growing weakness of the global economy, and in the United States in particular, has affected the purchasing behavior of our customers and led to lower revenue growth in our fourth quarter compared to previous quarters, delays in purchase decisions, and reduced visibility regarding future business. If economic growth in the United States and other countries economies continues to decline and or fail to recover, our customers may delay or reduce their purchases. This could result in reductions in sales of our products, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. In 2009, we will continue to invest in key research and development projects that we believe will lead to future growth while at the same time containing other costs and allocating resources effectively. Japan Distributor Audit In December 2008, during the course of our performance of routine distributor audits, we became aware of facts that caused us to question the accuracy of point of sale reports of a few distributors in Japan with respect to a small number of transactions. As a result, we commenced a review of revenue from sales through distributors in Japan, which was completed prior to the filing of this report. As a result of this review, we deferred $3.0 million of revenue for sales through distributors in Japan. Total revenues through distributors in Japan, after the $3.0 million deferral, were approximately $53.0 million in 2008 and approximately $13.0 million in the three months ended December 31, 2008. For financial data for the quarter ended December 31, 2008, which incorporates the results of 32 Table of Contents this review, please see Note 13 Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited) in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual report on Form 10 K. Stock Repurchase Activity In 2008, we repurchased $604.7 million, or 25.1 million share of common stock, under the following two stock repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors (the Board). Under the $2.0 billion stock repurchase program approved in 2006 and 2007 (the 2006 Stock Repurchase Program), we repurchased approximately 15.4 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $24.53 per share for a total purchase price of $376.8 million in 2008. As of December 31, 2008, we had repurchased and retired approximately 84.8 million shares of our common stock under the 2006 Stock Repurchase Program at an average price of $23.58 per share. The program has no remaining authorized funds available for future stock repurchases. The Board approved a $1.0 billion stock repurchase program in March 2008 (the 2008 Stock Repurchase Program). Under this program, we repurchased approximately 9.7 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $23.43 per share for a total purchase price of $227.9 million in 2008. As of December 31, 2008, the 2008 Stock Repurchase Program had remaining authorized funds of $772.1 million. See Note 14 Subsequent Events in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for discussion of our stock repurchase activity in 2009. Nature of Expenses Most of our manufacturing, repair, and supply chain operations are outsourced to independent contract manufacturers. Accordingly, most of our cost of revenues consists of payments to our independent contract manufacturers for the standard product costs. The independent contract manufacturers produce our products using design specifications, quality assurance programs, and standards that we establish. Controls around manufacturing, engineering, and documentation are conducted at our facilities in Sunnyvale, California, and Westford, Massachusetts. Our independent contract manufacturers have facilities primarily in Canada, China, Malaysia, Mexico, and the United States. We generally do not own the components and title to products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon shipment. The contract manufacturers procure components based on our build forecasts, and if actual component usage is lower than our forecasts, we may be, and have been in the past, liable for carrying or obsolete material charges. In recent years, an increasing amount of our products have been manufactured in Asia, and we anticipate that a larger percentage of our products will be produced outside the United States and Canada in the future. Our contracts generally provide for passage of title and risk of loss at the designated point of shipment to the customer. The manufacturing of products in Asia for shipment to customers in EMEA and the Americas resulted in additional shipment logistics, freight and timing issues for us and those customers. In an ongoing effort to balance our and the customers needs, we have made changes on occasion to the payment of freight and the point of shipment with respect to products shipped from Asia. These changes impact shipping costs and the timing of revenue recognition of the affected shipments. We have employees in our manufacturing and operations organization who manage relationships with our contract manufacturers, manage our supply chain, and monitor product testing and quality. Employee related costs have historically been the primary driver of our operating expenses, and we expect this trend to continue. Employee related costs include items such as wages, commissions, bonuses, vacation, benefits, stock based compensation, and travel. We had 7,014, 5,879, and 4,833 employees as of December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The year over year increases were primarily attributable to increases in our research and development and sales and marketing organizations. Our headcount is expected to remain flat in 2009 as we continue our cost reduction activities. We accounted for stock based compensation under the fair value approach of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R), in 2008, 2007, and 2006. Details of our stock based compensation expense are described in Note 10 Employee 33 Table of Contents Benefit Plans in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Facility and information technology departmental costs are allocated to other departments based on usage and headcount, respectively. These departmental costs have increased in 2008, 2007, and 2006 due to increases in headcount and facility leases resulting from infrastructure systems added to support our growth and past acquisitions. Facility and information technology related headcount was 267, 224, and 177 as of December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. In 2009, we expect to continue to invest in our company wide information technology infrastructure as we implement our operational excellence initiatives. Our operating expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the British Pound, the Euro, Indian Rupee, and Japanese Yen. Changes in related currency exchange rates may affect our operating results. Periodically, we use foreign currency forward and or option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to operating expenses. The effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and, upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction, is subsequently reclassified into the appropriate line item of the consolidated statement of operations to which the hedged transaction relates. Any ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments is reported in other income (expense) on our consolidated statements of operations. The increase in operating expenses including research and development, sales and marketing, as well as general and administrative expenses, due to foreign currency fluctuations was approximately 1% in 2008. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, to determine the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The critical accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies. To the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future results of operations may be affected. Revenue Recognition. Our products are generally integrated with software that is essential to the functionality of our equipment. Additionally, we provide unspecified upgrades and enhancements related to our integrated software through our maintenance contracts for most of our products. Accordingly, we account for revenue in accordance with Statement of Position No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, and all related interpretations. Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met: Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. We generally rely upon sales contracts, or agreements and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement. Delivery has occurred. We use shipping terms and related documents or written evidence of customer acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery or performance. In instances where we have outstanding obligations related to product delivery or the final acceptance of the product, revenue is deferred until all the delivery and acceptance criteria have been met. Sales price is fixed or determinable. We assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. Collectability is reasonably assured. We assess collectability based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by our credit checks and the customers payment history. We record accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts, estimated customer returns, and pricing credits. 34 Table of Contents For arrangements with multiple elements, such as sales of products that include services, we allocate revenue to each element using the residual method based on the vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value of the undelivered items. Under the residual method, the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements. VSOE of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately. We then recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with our policies for product and service revenue recognition. If VSOE of fair value of one or more undelivered items does not exist, revenue is deferred and recognized at the earlier of (i) delivery of those elements or (ii) when fair value can be established unless maintenance is the only undelivered element, in which case, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the contractual support period. Our ability to recognize revenue in the future may be affected if actual selling prices are significantly less than fair value. In addition, our ability to recognize revenue in the future could be impacted by conditions imposed by our customers. For sales to direct end users and value added resellers, we recognize product revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss, which is generally upon shipment. It is our practice to identify an end user prior to shipment to a value added reseller. For our end users and value added resellers, there are no significant obligations for future performance such as rights of return or pricing credits. A portion of our sales are made through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits or rights of return. We recognize product revenue on sales made through these distributors upon sell through as reported to us by the distributors. Deferred revenue on shipments to distributors reflects the effects of distributor pricing credits and the amount of gross margin expected to be realized upon sell through. Deferred revenue is recorded net of the related product costs of revenue. We record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments, such as rebates and price protection, in the same period that the related revenue is recorded. The amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns and price protection credits, specific criteria included in rebate agreements, and other factors known at the time. Should actual product returns or pricing adjustments differ from our estimates, additional reductions to revenue may be required. In addition, we report revenue net of sales taxes. Services include maintenance, training, and professional services. Maintenance is offered under renewable contracts. Revenue from maintenance service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the contractual support period, which is generally one to three years. Revenue from training and professional services is recognized as the services are completed or ratably over the contractual period, which is generally one year or less. We sell certain interests in accounts receivable on a non recourse basis as part of a distributor accounts receivable financing arrangement primarily with one major financing company. We record cash received under this arrangement in advance of revenue recognition as short term debt with a balance of $33.0 million and $10.0 million as of December 31, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Contract Manufacturer Liabilities. We outsource most of our manufacturing, repair, and supply chain management operations to our independent contract manufacturers and a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of payments to them. Our independent contract manufacturers procure components and manufacture our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts are based on our estimates of future demand for our products, which are in turn based on historical trends and an analysis from our sales and marketing organizations, adjusted for overall market conditions. We establish a provision for inventory, carrying costs and obsolete material exposures for excess components purchased based on historical trends. If the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecasted, which may be caused by factors outside of our control, it could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability. Supply chain management remains an area of focus as we balance the risk of material obsolescence and supply chain flexibility in order to reduce lead times. Warranty Costs. We generally offer a one year warranty on all of our hardware products and a 90 day warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the products. We accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs, labor costs for customer support, and overhead at the time revenue is recognized. Material cost is estimated primarily based upon the historical costs to repair or replace product returns within the warranty period. Technical support labor and overhead cost are estimated primarily based upon historical trends in the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period. Although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, use 35 Table of Contents of materials, technical labor costs and associated overhead incurred. Should actual product failure rates, use of materials, or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, we may incur additional warranty costs, which could reduce gross margin. Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets. Our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques. Goodwill is measured as the excess purchase price of an acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed. The amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization. The value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, could be impacted by future adverse changes such as: (i) future declines in our operating results, (ii) a sustained decline in our market capitalization, (iii) significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or the networking industry, or (iv) failure to meet our forecasted operating results. We evaluate these assets on an annual basis as of November 1 or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis. In the process of our annual impairment review, we determine the fair value of our intangible assets based upon a weighting of the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value of our reporting units by comparing them to transactions involving publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. Under the income approach, we calculate fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The weighted fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the allocated book value of each reporting unit. If the book value exceeds the fair value, we revalue the assets associated with the impaired reporting unit. The impairment is the difference between the new fair values and the existing book values of the impaired asset. The estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business. If our actual results or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets, we could incur additional impairment charges. Stock Based Compensation. We recognize stock based compensation expense for all share based payment awards including employee stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), performance share awards, and purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan granted after December 31, 2005, and granted prior to but not yet vested as of December 31, 2005, in accordance with SFAS 123R. We valued compensation expense for expected to vest stock based awards that were granted on or prior to December 31, 2005, under the multiple option approach. We amortize these share based payments using the accelerated attribution method. Subsequent to December 31, 2005, compensation expense for expected to vest stock based awards is valued under the single option approach and amortized on a straight line basis, net of estimated forfeitures. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, we accounted for stock based compensation under the intrinsic value recognition provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25). We utilize the Black Scholes Merton (BSM) option pricing model and incorporate a Monte Carlo simulation when appropriate in order to determine the fair value of stock based awards under SFAS 123R. The BSM model requires various highly subjective assumptions including volatility, expected option life, and risk free interest rate. The expected volatility is based on the implied volatility of market traded options on our common stock, adjusted for other relevant factors including historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock options. The expected life of an award is based on historical experience, the terms and conditions of the stock awards granted to employees, as well as the potential effect from options that have not been exercised at the time. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent managements best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of managements judgment. If factors change and we use different assumptions, our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those expected to vest shares. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, our recorded stock based compensation expense could be different. Income Taxes. Estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences and carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to 36 Table of Contents taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income based on the realization criteria set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). To the extent that we believe any amounts are not more likely than not to be realized, we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets. We believe it is more likely than not that future income from the reversal of the deferred tax liabilities and forecasted income will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event we determine that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Similarly, if we subsequently realize deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation allowance would be reversed, resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings or a decrease in goodwill in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities may result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimate of tax liabilities is less than the amount ultimately assessed, a further charge to expense would result. Significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding effect to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. On January 1, 2007, we adopted Financial Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which was a change in accounting for income taxes. FIN 48 contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with SFAS 109. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on de recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosures, and transition. The application of FIN 48 may increase an entitys future effective tax rates and its future intra period effective tax rate volatility. As of January 1, 2007, our cumulative effect of applying FIN 48 was a $19.2 million increase to the opening balance of accumulated deficit and a $1.0 million increase to goodwill. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions under FIN 48 and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves under FIN 48 are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserves under FIN 48 and any changes to the reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties, if applicable. Loss Contingencies. We are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset, or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We record a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the range of loss can 37 Table of Contents be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required. From time to time, we are involved in disputes, litigation, and other legal actions. We are aggressively defending our current litigation matters. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and these actions or other third party claims against us may cause us to incur costly litigation and or substantial settlement charges. In addition, the resolution of any future intellectual property litigation may require us to make royalty payments, which could adversely impact gross margins in future periods. If any of those events were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected. The actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses.

Results of Operations The following table shows total net product and service revenues and net product and service revenues as a percentage of total net revenues (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 $ Change % Change 2007 2006 $ Change % Change Net revenues: Product $ 2,911.0 $ 2,327.0 $ 584.0 25 % $ 2,327.0 $ 1,893.3 $ 433.7 23 % Percentage of net revenues 81.5 % 82.0 % 82.0 % 82.2 % Service 661.4 509.1 152.3 30 % 509.1 410.3 98.8 24 % Percentage of net revenues 18.5 % 18.0 % 18.0 % 17.8 % Total net revenues $ 3,572.4 $ 2,836.1 $ 736.3 26 % $ 2,836.1 $ 2,303.6 $ 532.5 23 % Our net product revenues increased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to increased sales of products from both our Infrastructure and SLT solutions to the service provider and enterprise markets. In particular, we had success in selling our Infrastructure products to service providers who are adopting NGN IP networks, which are designed for higher capacity and efficiency to help reduce total operating costs and to be able to offer multiple services over a single network. In 2008, our new product releases and further expansion into emerging markets contributed to the increase in total net product revenues. Our net service revenues increased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to the increase in maintenance revenue from our expanding installed base of equipment under service contracts. Our net revenues increased in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to growth in both product and service revenues. Our revenue performance and share gains were driven by Infrastructure and SLT product revenues. Service revenues also increased in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to the increase in our installed base of equipment under service contracts and, to a lesser extent, growth in professional service revenues. 38 Table of Contents Changes to Segments Beginning in January 2008, we realigned our reporting structure which resulted in two segments: Infrastructure and SLT. The previously reported Service segment has been combined into the following two segments: Infrastructure: Our Infrastructure segment consists primarily of products and services related to the E , M , MX , and T series router product families, EX series switching products, as well as the circuit to circuit products. SLT: Our SLT segment consists primarily of products and services related to our firewall/VPN (Firewall) systems and appliances, SSL VPN appliances, IDP appliances, the J series router product family, and WAN optimization platforms. Infrastructure Segment Revenues The following table shows net Infrastructure segment revenues and net Infrastructure segment revenues as a percentage of total net revenues by product and service categories (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007(1) $ Change % Change 2007(1) 2006(1) $ Change % Change Net Infrastructure segment revenues: Infrastructure product revenues $ 2,301.9 $ 1,753.2 $ 548.7 31 % $ 1,753.2 $ 1,413.4 $ 339.8 24 % Percentage of net revenues 64.4 % 61.8 % 61.8 % 61.3 % Infrastructure service revenues 424.0 320.1 103.9 32 % 320.1 266.7 53.4 20 % Percentage of net revenues 11.9 % 11.3 % 11.3 % 11.6 % Total Infrastructure segment revenues(1) $ 2,725.9 $ 2,073.3 $ 652.6 31 % $ 2,073.3 $ 1,680.1 $ 393.2 23 % Percentage of net revenues 76.3 % 73.1 % 73.1 % 72.9 % (1) Prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect the 2008 segment structure, which now includes service revenues in the Infrastructure and SLT segments. Infrastructure Product Infrastructure product revenues increased in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily attributable to revenue growth from our M MX and T series product families, from sales to both the service provider and enterprise markets due to our customers increased demand for network infrastructure solutions. To a lesser extent, our EX series products, which were introduced in the first quarter of 2008, and our E series products also contributed to the revenue growth in 2008. In 2008, we experienced sales growth in both the service provider and enterprise markets. From a geographical perspective, in 2008, we experienced revenue growth in all three regions, with particular strength in the Americas region. Infrastructure product revenues increased in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily attributable to increased revenues from our M , T , and MX series router products, driven by our service provider customers continued build out of NGNs as their bandwidth requirement increased. Our service provider customers also moved towards NGNs that are designed to enable a fast and cost effective deployment of differentiating multi play services that allow them to generate new sources of revenues. Also contributing to the revenue growth was an increase in Infrastructure product sales to the content service provider and the enterprise markets. From a geographical perspective, we experienced revenue growth in all three regions with particular strength in the Americas region. We track Infrastructure chassis revenue units and ports shipped to analyze customer trends and indicate areas of potential network growth. Most of our Infrastructure product platforms are modular, with the chassis serving as the base of the platform. Each chassis has a certain number of slots that are available to be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces. The modules are the components through which the platform receives incoming packets of data from a variety of transmission media. The physical connection between a transmission medium and a module is referred to as a port. The number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the functionality and throughput offered by the module. Chassis revenue units represent the number of 39 Table of Contents chassis on which revenue was recognized during the period. The following table shows Infrastructure revenue units and ports shipped: Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Unit Change % Change 2007 2006 Unit Change % Change Infrastructure chassis revenue units(1) 13,745 11,195 2,550 23 % 11,195 10,211 984 10 % Infrastructure ports shipped(1) 397,907 225,452 172,455 76 % 225,452 160,318 65,134 41 % (1) Excludes fixed configuration Ethernet switching products. Infrastructure chassis revenue units increased in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to the product mix that favored higher capacity chassis revenue units, which was driven by bandwidth demand as our customers sought to expand capabilities in their networks and to offer differentiating, feature rich, multi play services that allow them to generate new sources of revenues. The port shipments also increased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to the increase in the overall number of chassis revenue units from richly configured T and M series router chassis revenue units shipped during the 2008 period. Chassis revenue units increased in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to the introduction of the MX series products, which are our Carrier Ethernet services routers. We also experienced growth in our M and T series products, driven by bandwidth demand as service provider customers sought to expand voice and video capability in their existing networks. The port shipment units increased in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to the growth in chassis revenue units with larger expansion capacity and our customers need to differentiate themselves by providing feature rich, multi play services. Infrastructure Service Infrastructure service revenues increased in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to an increase in our installed base of equipment being serviced. Installed base is calculated based on the number of systems that our customers have under maintenance. A majority of our service revenues is earned from customers that purchase our products and simultaneously enter into service contracts for support service. We also experienced increased professional service revenues due to consulting projects. Infrastructure service revenues increased in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily driven by increased technical support service contracts associated with higher Infrastructure product sales, which have resulted in increased renewals and a larger installed base of equipment being serviced. To a lesser extent, professional services also contributed to the growth in net service revenues in 2007. Professional service revenues increased primarily due to large customer deployments requiring consulting services. SLT Segment Revenues The following table shows net SLT segment revenues and net SLT segment revenues as a percentage of total net revenues by product and service categories (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007(1) $ Change % Change 2007(1) 2006(1) $ Change % Change Net SLT segment revenues: SLT product revenues $ 609.1 $ 573.8 $ 35.3 6 % $ 573.8 $ 479.9 $ 93.9 20 % Percentage of net revenues 17.1 % 20.2 % 20.2 % 20.8 % SLT service revenues 237.4 189.0 48.4 26 % 189.0 143.6 45.4 32 % Percentage of net revenues 6.6 % 6.7 % 6.7 % 6.3 % Total SLT segment revenues(1) $ 846.5 $ 762.8 $ 83.7 11 % $ 762.8 $ 623.5 $ 139.3 22 % Percentage of net revenues 23.7 % 26.9 % 26.9 % 27.1 % (1) Prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect the 2008 segment structure, which now includes service revenues in the Infrastructure and SLT segments. 40 Table of Contents SLT Product SLT product revenues increased in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to an increase in revenues from Firewall and J series products. These increases were partially offset by a decline in revenues from DX and WX products. The integrated systems introduced prior to 2007, such as the SSG Firewall products, gained further traction in the market place with revenues from these product lines growing in 2008 compared to 2007. In 2008, we experienced sales growth both in the service provider and enterprise markets. Geographically, revenues increased in the EMEA and APAC regions and decreased in the Americas region. SLT product revenues increased in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily attributable to the increased revenues across the majority of the SLT product families, in particular, the Firewall, SSL, WAN Optimization and J series products. The integrated systems introduced prior to 2007, such as the ISG and SSG firewall products, gained traction in the market place and generated additional revenues in 2007. All three geographic regions had significant growth in SLT revenues during 2007. We experienced a growing demand for our SLT products in both the enterprise and service provider markets as we focused on cross selling more integrated products and solutions in the enterprise and service provider markets while leveraging partnerships with open standards based interoperability of our SLT products. The following table shows SLT revenue units recognized: Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Unit Change % Change 2007 2006 Unit Change % Change SLT revenue units 241,504 239,021 2,483 1 % 239,021 183,575 55,446 30 % SLT revenue units increased slightly in 2008 compared to 2007. The percentage increase in SLT revenue units was lower than the percentage increase in product revenues, primarily due to the product mix that favored products with higher average selling prices. In January 2008, we announced a plan to phase out our DX product line. These products will be supported until 2013. We do not expect this plan to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. SLT revenue units increased in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily attributable to the growing demand for our SLT products in the market place. The percentage increase in SLT revenue units was greater than the percentage increase in product revenues, primarily due to the increased revenues from sales of our branch Firewall products, which have lower average selling price than other SLT products. SLT Service SLT service revenues increased in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to an increase in our installed base of equipment being serviced. A majority of our service revenues is earned from customers that purchase our products and simultaneously enter into support service contracts. SLT service revenues increased in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily driven by an increase in support service contracts associated with the increase in SLT product sales. To a lesser extent, professional services also contributed to the growth in net service revenues in 2007. 41 Table of Contents Total Net Revenues by Geographic Region The following table shows total net revenues by geographic region (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 $ Change % Change 2007 2006 $ Change % Change Americas: United States $ 1,538.1 $ 1,215.8 $ 322.3 27 % $ 1,215.8 $ 950.3 $ 265.5 28 % Other 228.1 124.7 103.4 83 % 124.7 83.0 41.7 50 % Total Americas 1,766.2 1,340.5 425.7 32 % 1,340.5 1,033.3 307.2 30 % Percentage of net revenues 49.4 % 47.3 % 47.3 % 44.8 % EMEA 1,077.7 918.0 159.7 17 % 918.0 817.4 100.6 12 % Percentage of net revenue 30.2 % 32.4 % 32.4 % 35.5 % APAC 728.5 577.6 150.9 26 % 577.6 452.9 124.7 28 % Percentage of net revenues: 20.4 % 20.3 % 20.3 % 19.7 % Total $ 3,572.4 $ 2,836.1 $ 736.3 26 % $ 2,836.1 $ 2,303.6 $ 532.5 23 % Net revenues in the Americas region increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to growth in Infrastructure revenues from both the service provider and enterprise markets, as our customers continued to focus on increasing network performance, reliability, and scale.

Net revenues to the service provider market increased by 24% in 2007 compared to 2006. Net revenues to the enterprise market increased by 22% in 2007 compared to 2006. No single customer accounted for 10.0% or more of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008. NSN and its predecessor companies accounted for greater than 10.0% of our net revenues in 2007 and 2006. Cost of Revenues The following table shows cost of product and service revenues and the related gross margin (GM) percentages (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 $ Change % Change 2007 2006 $ Change % Change Cost of revenues: Product $ 867.6 $ 676.2 $ 191.4 28 % $ 676.2 $ 555.1 $ 121.1 22 % GM percentage of revenues 70.2 % 70.9 % 70.9 % 70.7 % Service 298.4 251.4 47.0 19 % 251.4 199.2 52.2 26 % GM percentage of revenues 54.9 % 50.6 % 50.6 % 51.4 % Total cost of revenues $ 1,166.0 $ 927.6 $ 238.4 26 % $ 927.6 $ 754.3 $ 173.3 23 % GM percentage of revenues 67.4 % 67.3 % 67.3 % 67.3 % The cost of product revenues increased in absolute dollars in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to our increase in product revenues, which resulted in higher product costs. The slight decrease in product gross margin as a percentage of product revenues in 2008 compared to 2007, is primarily attributable to changes in the product mix, partially offset by growth in our higher margin T and M series product families within our Infrastructure segment and increased sales of our higher margin Firewall and J series products within our SLT segment. As of December 31, 2008, and 2007, we had 230 and 190 employees, respectively, in our manufacturing and operations organization that primarily manage relationships with our contract manufacturers, manage our supply chain, and monitor and manage product testing and quality. The cost of product revenues increased in absolute dollars in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily attributable to increased product revenues in both the enterprise and service provider markets. The product gross margin slightly increased in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to favorable product mix and, to a lesser extent, improvements in standard costs of our Infrastructure products, partially offset by a slight decrease in our SLT product gross margin. As of December 31, 2007, and 2006, we had 190 and 149 employees, respectively, in our manufacturing and operations organization. The cost of service revenues and service gross margin increased in 2008 compared to 2007. The increase was commensurate with the growth in revenues in absolute dollars attributable to the growth in our installed equipment base. Service related headcount increased by 35 employees, or 5%, to 783 employees in 2008, compared to 748 in 2007. Personnel related charges, consisting of salaries, bonus, fringe benefits expenses, and stock based compensation expenses, represented the majority of the increases in cost of service revenues in 2008. Total personnel related charges as a percentage of service revenues were approximately 20% for 2008 and 23% for 2007. The decrease in personnel related charges in 2008 as a percentage of service revenues, is primarily due to the overall increase in service revenues. Our outside service expense also increased in 2008, primarily to support the expanding installed equipment base. Freight related expense increased primarily to support larger volume of spare parts in supporting our growth. Additionally, facilities and information technology expenses related to cost of service revenues increased in connection with the growth of service business as a portion of our overall operations. Cost of service revenues increased in 2007 compared to 2006, while service gross margin decreased slightly in 2007 as compared to 2006. The increase in service costs and the decrease in gross margin were primarily 43 Table of Contents attributable to increases in headcount related expenses associated with expanding our service delivery infrastructure and professional service organization, particularly in North America and in India, as well as increasing our resources for supporting network build outs and deployments by our customers. Service related headcount increased by 137 employees, or 22%, to 748 employees in 2007, compared to 611 in 2006. Personnel related charges, consisting of salaries, bonus, fringe benefits expenses, and stock based compensation expenses, represented the majority of the increases in cost of service revenues in 2007. Total personnel related charges as a percentage of service revenues were approximately 23% and 21% for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Outside service expense increased as we used outside providers to support the increase in customer support contracts and professional engagements. Freight related expense increased due to the deployment of spare parts in supporting our growth overseas. Facilities and information technology expenses related to the cost of service revenues increased in 2007, which is consistent with other areas of our organization, due to our headcount growth and investment in internal infrastructure to support our growing business. Partially offsetting the increases was a decrease in spares component purchases due to a large purchase we made in 2006.

Personnel related charges, consisting of salaries, bonus, fringe benefits expenses, and stock based compensation expenses, which comprise the majority of our research and development expenses, increased primarily due to headcount growth and merit based salary increases in 2007. Research and development related headcount increased by 493 employees, or 24%, in 2007 to 2,563 employees as of December 31, 2007. Headcount increase was primarily due to additional hires in the engineering organization within the Infrastructure segment. In addition to personnel related expenses, we also increased prototype and lab equipment expenses in 2007 for the development of our new products. Additionally, facilities and information technology expenses, as well as depreciation expenses, for our research and development organization increased in 2007 due to increases in headcount from additional internal systems to support our growth. In general, we grew our engineering organizations to support product innovation, expand and improve our product portfolio, and address growth opportunities in NGN bandwidth and features for our service provider and enterprise customers. Sales and Marketing Expenses Sales and marketing expenses include costs for selling and promoting our products and services, demonstration equipment, and advertisements. These costs vary quarter to quarter depending on revenues, product launches, and marketing initiatives. We have an extensive distribution channel in place that we use to target new customers and increase sales. We have made substantial investments in our distribution channel during 2008, 2007, and 2006. Sales and marketing expenses increased in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to increases in personnel related expenses and marketing expenses. As a percentage of net revenues, sales and marketing expenses decreased in 2008 due to our focus on managing expenses and creating efficiency in our sales activities. Personnel related charges, consisting of salaries, commissions, bonus, fringe benefits, and stock based compensation expenses, increased $70.8 million, or 17%, to $497.2 million in 2008, primarily due to an 18% increase in headcount in our worldwide sales and marketing organizations, from 1,863 to 2,190 employees. Included in personnel related charges was an increase in commission expense of $5.3 million in 2008 compared to 2007, due to our higher net revenues. We also increased our investment in corporate and channel marketing efforts from the prior year. As our sales force grew, we also increased facilities and information technology expenses related to the sales and marketing organizations in 2008 compared to 2007. Sales and marketing expenses increased 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to increases in personnel related charges. As a percentage of net revenues, sales and marketing expenses decreased slightly in 2007 due to our focus on increasing our operating margin and the efficiency of our sales activities. The increases in absolute dollars were primarily headcount related increases. Sales and marketing related headcount increased 272 employees, or 17%, in 2007 to 1,863 as of December 31, 2007, as we hired additional personnel across our Infrastructure and SLT organizations to support the larger product portfolio and to expand our presence in the enterprise marketplace. In addition, commission expenses increased primarily as a result of strong revenue growth. In 2007, we also increased 45 Table of Contents consulting expenses to support our sales and marketing initiatives. Likewise, our demand for demonstration equipment has grown as we seek to capture new markets and release new products. As the sales and marketing organization expands, we have also grown our facilities and information technology expenses related to the sales and marketing organization. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses include professional fees, bad debt provisions, and other corporate expenses. Professional fees include legal, audit, tax, accounting, and certain corporate strategic services. General and administrative expenses increased in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to an increase in personnel related expenses and outside professional services. As a percentage of net revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased slightly in 2008 due to our focus on managing expenses and growing revenues. Personnel related charges, consisting of salaries, bonus, fringe benefits, and stock based compensation expenses, increased $12.4 million, or 21%, to $71.2 million in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to a 20% increase in headcount in our worldwide general and administrative functions, from 291 to 350 employees, to support the overall growth of the business. Outside professional service fees increased in 2008 compared to 2007, as a result of increased legal fees and business process re engineering costs. Additionally, facilities and information technology expenses related to our general and administrative infrastructure increased to support our growing business. General and administrative expenses increased in 2007 compared to 2006. As a percentage of net revenues, general and administrative expenses slightly decreased in 2007 due to our focus on increasing our operating margin. The increases in absolute dollars were primarily due to a 24% increase in headcount in our worldwide general and administrative functions, from 235 to 291 employees, to support the overall growth of the business. The headcount increases were primarily in the finance and human resources organizations as we expanded our organization infrastructure in lower cost regions, improved internal processes, and continued our initiatives to update our information systems. Outside services increased $4.5 million in 2007 compared to 2006, as we invested in designing a more efficient organizational structure and improving our internal systems. Such increases were offset by decreases in accounting and legal fees of $1.5 million for 2007, compared to 2006. Consistent with other areas of our organization, facilities and information technology expenses related to our general and administrative infrastructure increased in order to support these initiatives and the growth of our business. Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets Amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to a decrease in amortization expense as certain purchased intangible assets became fully amortized during the second quarter of 2008. Amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to certain purchased intangible assets reaching the end of their amortization period during 2007. Impairment of Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets We had no impairment against our goodwill in 2008 and 2007. In 2008, we recognized an impairment charge of $5.0 million against our purchased intangible assets, as a result of the phase out of our DX products. We had no impairment on our purchased intangible assets in 2007. In 2006, we incurred impairment charges of $1,283.4 million as a result of the impairment of both goodwill and purchased intangible assets. The impairment charges were primarily due to the decline in our market capitalization that occurred over a period of approximately six months prior to the impairment review and, to a lesser extent, to a decrease in the forecasted future cash flows used in the income approach. Based upon our impairment review, we reduced the carrying value of goodwill within the SLT segment by $1,280.0 million. In 2006, we recorded a $3.4 million impairment charge pertaining to a write down of purchased intangible assets as a result of a decrease in our revenue forecast for our Session Border Control (SBC) products. See Note 5 Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for more information on our impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets. 46 Table of Contents Other Charges, Net Other charges are summarized as follows: Restructuring and Acquisition Related Charges. There were no restructuring and acquisition related charges in 2008. In 2007, we recorded net restructuring and acquisition related charges of $0.7 million, of which $1.1 million pertained to bonus accruals associated with past acquisitions, partially offset by a benefit of $0.4 million pertaining to net restructuring adjustments. We recorded net restructuring and acquisition related charges of $5.9 million in 2006, of which $5.6 million was due to accrued bonuses associated with past acquisitions, and $0.3 million was due to net restructuring related charges, including $0.7 million in restructuring charges associated with a program to reduce product development costs and the discontinuation of our SBC product. Stock Option Investigation Costs. There were no such stock option investigation costs recorded in 2008. We recorded expenses of $6.0 million and $20.5 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, related to professional fees and other costs in connection with our investigation into historical stock option granting practices. Stock Option Amendment and Tax Related Charges. There were no stock option amendment and tax related charges recorded in 2008. We recorded $8.0 million and $10.1 million in operating expense during 2007 and 2006, respectively, in relation to the amendment of stock options and to the payment of certain taxes and penalties associated with employee stock option exercises. Net Settlement (Loss) Gain. We recorded a net legal settlement loss of $9.0 million in 2008, related to our shareholder derivative lawsuit. In 2007, we recognized a net legal settlement gain of $5.3 million, which consisted of cash settlement proceeds of $6.2 million, net of the $0.9 million legal expense related to direct transaction costs incurred in the third quarter of 2007. There were no legal settlement gains or losses recorded in 2006. Net Interest and Other Income, Gain (Loss) on Equity Investments, and Income Tax Provision The following table shows net interest and other income and income tax provision (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 $ Change % Change 2007 2006 $ Change % Change Interest and other income, net $ 48.7 $ 96.8 $ (48.1 ) (50 )% $ 96.8 $ 100.7 $ (3.9 ) (4 )% Percentage of net revenues 1.4 % 3.4 % 3.4 % 4.4 % (Loss) gain on equity investments (14.8 ) 6.7 (21.5 ) (321 )% 6.7 6.7 100 % Percentage of net revenues (0.4 )% 0.2 % 0.2 % Income tax provision 217.2 149.8 67.4 45 % 149.8 104.4 45.4 43 % Percentage of net revenues 6.1 % 5.3 % 5.3 % 4.5 % Interest and Other Income, Net Net interest and other income decreased in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to lower interest rates during 2008. Net interest and other income decreased in 2007 compared to 2006, resulting from a decrease in interest income due to a lower cash, cash equivalents and investment balance, which was attributable to common stock repurchases of approximately $1.6 billion during the first and second quarters of 2007. Partially offsetting the decreases was the higher interest yield combined with higher positive cash flows from operations compared to 2006. Interest and other expenses slightly increased in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to costs associated with our distributor financing program. See Note 8 Debt in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for a full description of our distributor financing program. Other interest 47 Table of Contents and expenses include short term debt expenses, debt issuance cost amortization, foreign exchange losses, and other miscellaneous expenses such as bank fees. (Loss) Gain on Equity Investments During 2008, we recognized impairment losses of $14.8 million on our investments in privately held and publicly traded companies for changes in fair value that we believed were other than temporary. In June 2007, one of the companies in which we had a minority equity investment completed an initial public offering (IPO). As a result, we realized a gain of $6.7 million during 2007 based upon the difference between the market value of our investment at the time of the IPO and our cost basis. During 2006, none of our investments had any recognized gain or loss. Income Tax Provision Our effective tax rates were 29.8%, 29.3%, and (11.6%) in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The increase in the overall rate in 2008 compared to 2007, was primarily due to the differences in the geographic mix of our taxable income and the level of research and development credits in the U.S. The 2006 effective tax rate differs from 2008 and 2007, primarily due to the inability to benefit from a substantial portion of the goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2006. We are currently under examination by the IRS for the 2004 tax year, the Indian tax authorities for the 2004 tax year, and the German tax authorities for the 2005 tax year. Additionally, we have not reached a final resolution with the IRS on an adjustment it proposed for the 1999 and 2000 tax years. We are not under examination by any other major jurisdictions in which we file income tax returns as of December 31, 2008. In September 2008, as part of the on going 2004 IRS audit, we received a proposed adjustment related to our business credit carry forwards, which if agreed, would reduce our business credit carry forwards. In December 2008, we received a proposed adjustment from the Indian tax authorities related to the 2004 tax year. We are pursuing all available administrative procedures relative to these matters. In December 2008, we reached a tentative settlement with the German tax authorities for the 2005 tax year. We believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcomes related to these proposed adjustments and the ultimate resolution of these matters is unlikely to have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. We do not expect complete resolution of any IRS, or other audits within significant foreign or state jurisdictions within the next 12 months. However, it is reasonably possible that we may reach agreement with certain issues and as a result, the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by approximately $13.0 million within the next 12 months. For a complete reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and further explanation of our income tax provision, see Note 12 Income Taxes in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Segment Information For a description of the products and services for each segment, see Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. A description of the measures included in management operating income (loss) can also be found in Note 11 Segment Information in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We have included segment financial data for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008, for comparative purposes. 48 Table of Contents Financial information for each segment used by management to make financial decisions and allocate resources is as follows (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007(1) $ Change % Change 2007(1) 2006(1) $ Change % Change Net revenues: Infrastructure: Product $ 2,301.9 $ 1,753.2 $ 548.7 31 % $ 1,753.2 $ 1,413.4 $ 339.8 24 % Service 424.0 320.1 103.9 32 % 320.1 266.7 53.4 20 % Total Infrastructure revenues 2,725.9 2,073.3 652.6 31 % 2,073.3 1,680.1 393.2 23 % Service Layer Technologies: Product 609.1 573.8 35.3 6 % 573.8 479.9 93.9 20 % Service 237.4 189.0 48.4 26 % 189.0 143.6 45.4 32 % Total Service Layer Technologies revenues 846.5 762.8 83.7 11 % 762.8 623.5 139.3 22 % Total net revenues 3,572.4 2,836.1 736.3 26 % 2,836.1 2,303.6 532.5 23 % Operating income: Infrastructure 806.0 597.8 208.2 35 % 597.8 505.9 91.9 18 % Service Layer Technologies 65.8 5.8 60.0 N/M 5.8 5.2 0.6 12 % Total segment operating income 871.8 603.6 268.2 44 % 603.6 511.1 92.5 18 % Other corporate(2) (7.9 ) (7.9 ) N/M N/M Total management operating income 863.9 603.6 260.3 43 % 603.6 511.1 92.5 18 % Amortization of purchased intangible assets (44.0 ) (91.4 ) 47.4 (52 )% (91.4 ) (97.3 ) 5.9 (6 )% Stock based compensation expense (108.1 ) (88.0 ) (20.1 ) 23 % (88.0 ) (87.6 ) (0.4 ) N/M Stock based payroll tax expense (2.8 ) (7.7 ) 4.9 (64 )% (7.7 ) (2.7 ) (5.0 ) 185 % Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets (5.0 ) 5.0 100 % (1,283.4 ) 1,283.4 (100 )% Other charges, net(3) (9.0 ) (9.4 ) 0.4 N/M (9.4 ) (37.9 ) 28.5 (75 )% Total operating income (loss) 695.0 407.1 287.9 71 % 407.1 (997.8 ) 1,404.9 141 % Other income and expense, net 33.9 103.5 (69.6 ) (67 )% 103.5 100.7 2.8 3 % Income (loss) before income taxes $ 728.9 $ 510.6 $ 218.3 43 % $ 510.6 $ (897.1 ) $ 1,407.7 157 % N/M Not meaningful.

Infrastructure Segment An analysis of the change in revenues for the Infrastructure segment, and the change in revenue units, can be found above in the section titled Net Revenues. Infrastructure segment operating income increased in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to revenue growth from our router product families and, to a lesser extent, our new Ethernet switching product family, which outpaced 50 Table of Contents expense growth. Infrastructure product gross margin increased in absolute dollars in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to revenues from richly configured high end T and M series router products as well as high margin port shipments. The Infrastructure gross margin percentage decreased slightly in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to product mix, particularly from an increase in the mix of lower margin E series products in 2008. We continued to invest in research and development efforts to continue our innovation of products and expand our Infrastructure product portfolio, but our research and development expense decreased as a percentage of Infrastructure net revenues in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to cost control initiatives that resulted in revenue growing faster than expenses. We will continue to make investments to expand our product features and functionality based upon the trends in the marketplace. Additionally, our sales and marketing expenses decreased slightly as a percentage of Infrastructure net revenues, but increased in absolute dollars in 2008 compared to 2007, as we increased our efforts to reach enterprise and service provider customers. We allocate sales and marketing, general and administrative, as well as facility and information technology expenses to the Infrastructure segment generally based upon revenue, usage, and headcount. Infrastructure segment operating income increased in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to revenue growth from our router product families, which outpaced expense growth. Our increase in revenue was partially offset by our continued investments in research and development efforts as we sought to continue our innovation of products and expand our Infrastructure product portfolio. In 2007, our sales and marketing expenses decreased slightly as a percentage of net revenues, but increased in absolute dollars as we increased our efforts to reach enterprise and service provider customers. SLT Segment An analysis of the change in revenues for the SLT segment, and the change in units, can be found above in the section titled Net Revenues. SLT segment operating income increased in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to revenue growth in our Firewall and J series products and the growth in our installed equipment base for service contracts, which outpaced the increase in SLT expenses. SLT product gross margin and gross margin percentage increased in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to product mix, particularly from an increase in the mix of higher margin Firewall and J series products in 2008. Research and development related costs increased in absolute dollars, but decreased as a percentage of SLT revenues in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to the addition of headcount in regions with lower operating costs and revenue growing faster than research and development expenses. Additionally, sales and marketing as well as general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of SLT net revenues in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to our focused execution. We allocate sales and marketing, general and administrative, as well as facility and information technology expenses to the SLT segment generally based on revenue, usage, and headcount. In the past, we have generally experienced quarterly seasonality and fluctuations in the demand for our SLT products, particularly in the fourth quarter, which may result in greater variations in our quarterly operating results. SLT segment operating income increased slightly in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to revenue growth, which outpaced the increase in SLT expenses. SLT product gross margin and gross margin percentage increased in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to product mix, particularly from an increase that favored higher margin products. The increase in SLT operating expenses was due primarily to the increase in information technology expenses allocated to the SLT segment and the higher variable compensation expenses associated with company wide revenue growth. Additionally, we strategically invested in our research and development efforts to develop technologies and products for the JUNOS platform. In an effort to control costs, we moved a significant portion of the SLT development organization to lower cost regions while expanding our product portfolio. SLT segment operating income was affected by continued investments in our sales and distribution channels. SLT gross margin decreased slightly in 2007 compared to 2006, due to higher manufacturing costs associated with new and more complex products. Higher manufacturing costs were partially offset by our cost reduction efforts to move more manufacturing to lower cost regions. The increases in SLT operating expenses were partially offset by our revenue growth especially in the fourth quarter of 2007 due to increased customer demand for security products, particularly Firewall, and due to typical quarterly seasonality. 51 Table of Contents Stock Based Compensation and Related Payroll Taxes Stock based compensation expense increased in 2008 compared to 2007. The increase was primarily attributable to new stock options and RSU grants during 2008 and the timing of the recognition of stock based compensation expense for RSUs granted in the last month of the fourth quarter of 2007. Stock based compensation related payroll tax expense, which represents employment taxes we incurred in connection with our employee stock programs decreased in 2008 compared to 2007. Changes in such expenses are primarily attributable to the timing and volume of stock options exercises by our employees. We experienced a considerable decrease in these expenses due to the decrease in our share price during 2008. Stock based compensation expense increased in 2007 compared to 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to new stock options and RSU grants, partially offset by the lower stock option expense in 2007 resulting from the acceleration of vesting of certain unvested and out of the money stock options completed in December 2005 (2005 stock option vesting acceleration). Stock based compensation related payroll tax expense increased in 2007 compared to 2006. We experienced a considerable increase in these expenses due to the increase in our share price during 2007. In contrast, employee stock option exercises were restricted during the majority of 2006 due to our stock option investigation. Key Performance Measures In addition to the financial metrics included in the consolidated financial statements, we use the following key performance measures to assess operating results: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Days sales outstanding (DSO)(1) 42 42 38 Book to bill ratio(2) 1 1 1 (1) DSO is calculated as the ratio of ending accounts receivable, net of allowances, divided by average daily net sales for the preceding 90 days. (2) Book to bill ratio represents the ratio of product orders booked divided by product revenues during the respective period. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following sections discuss the effects of changes in our consolidated balance sheet and cash flows, contractual obligations, other commitments, and our stock repurchase program on our liquidity and capital resources. Overview Historically, we have funded our business primarily through our operating activities and the issuance of our common stock. The following table shows our capital resources (in millions, except percentages): As of December 31, 2008 2007 $ Change % Change Working capital $ 1,759.6 $ 1,175.3 $ 584.3 50 % Cash and cash equivalents 2,019.1 1,716.1 303.0 18 % Short term investments 172.9 240.4 (67.5 ) (28 )% Long term investments 101.4 59.3 42.1 71 % Total $ 2,293.4 $ 2,015.8 $ 277.6 14 % The significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, and accounts receivable, reduced by accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and deferred revenue. The increase in 52 Table of Contents working capital from December 31, 2007, to December 31, 2008, is primarily due to the increase in cash and cash equivalents, and the non cash settlement of the current portion of long term debt due to the maturity of our senior convertible notes in June 2008. See Note 8 Debt in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for discussion of our senior convertible notes. The increase in cash and cash equivalents during 2008 is primarily due to cash generated by our operating activities of $875.2 million along with the issuance of common stock for $119.5 million through stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan purchases, partially offset by repurchases of our common stock of $604.7 million. Summary of Cash Flows Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $875.2 million, $786.5 million, and $755.6 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The cash provided by operating activities for each period was due to our net income (loss) adjusted by: Non cash charges of $255.8 million, $257.5 million, and $1,536.4 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. These non cash charges primarily related to depreciation and amortization expenses, stock based compensation, excess tax benefits from employee stock based compensation, and gain/loss on equity investments. In 2006, non cash charges also included charges of $1,283.4 million related to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. Net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $107.6 million, $168.2 million, and $220.6 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, were generated in the normal course of business. These changes were primarily due to increases in accounts payable, accrued compensation, taxes payable, and deferred revenue, partially offset by accounts receivable. The increase in accounts payable was due to the timing of payments to contract manufacturers and the growth of our business. The increase in accrued compensation was due to increases in headcount. Additionally, the increase in accrued compensation in 2007 compared to 2006, was due to the removal of a suspension on employee purchases of shares under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The increase in taxes payable was due to the increase in the tax provision, movement of deferred tax assets, and the timing of payments. The increase in deferred revenue was due to the growing installed base and customer payments in advance of product acceptance. In addition, these increases in cash flows from operations were partially offset by a negative cash flow due to an increase in net accounts receivable, which was primarily due to the growth in our business and net revenues. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $149.8 million for 2008 as compared to net cash generated by investing activities of $571.8 million in 2007. In 2006, cash generated by investing activities was $11.9 million. The changes between periods was primarily due to the movement of cash from short and long term investments to cash and cash equivalents during 2007 in anticipation of stock repurchases under the 2006 Stock Repurchase Program. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $422.4 million, $1,238.5 million and $89.6 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. In 2008, we used $604.7 million to repurchase our common stock, partially offset by cash proceeds of $119.5 million from common stock issued to employees, compared to the $1,623.2 million of common stock repurchases in 2007, partially offset by cash proceeds of $355.0 million from common stock issued to employees. In 2006, we used $186.4 million to repurchase our common stock, partially offset by cash proceeds of $87.1 million from common stock issued to employees. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements None 53 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Our principal commitments primarily consist of obligations outstanding under operating leases, purchase commitments, tax liabilities, and other contractual obligations. The following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in millions): Less Than More Than Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Other Operating leases, net of committed subleases(1) $ 208.6 $ 50.8 $ 124.1 $ 29.8 $ 3.9 $ Purchase commitments(2) 86.8 86.8 Tax liabilities(3) 91.2 13.0 78.2 Other contractual obligations(4) 68.9 30.6 36.4 1.9 Total $ 455.5 $ 181.2 $ 160.5 $ 31.7 $ 3.9 $ 78.2 (1) Our contractual obligations under operating leases primarily relate to our leased facilities under our non cancelable operating leases. Rent payments are allocated to costs and operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. We occupy approximately 1.9 million square feet worldwide under operating leases. The majority of our office space is in North America, including our corporate headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. Our longest lease expires in January 2017. (2) In order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply, our contract manufacturers place non cancelable, non returnable (NCNR) orders for components based on our build forecasts. The contract manufacturers use the components to build products based on our forecasts and on purchase orders we have received from our customers. Generally, we do not own the components and title to the products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon delivery at a designated shipment location. If the components go unused or the products go unsold for specified periods of time, we may incur carrying charges or obsolete materials charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders. As of December 31, 2008, we had accrued $30.4 million based on our estimate of such charges. Total purchase commitments as of December 31, 2008, consisted of $86.8 million NCNR orders. (3) Tax liabilities include the current and long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet for unrecognized tax positions. It is reasonably possible that we may reach agreement with certain issues and, as a result, the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by approximately $13.0 million within the next 12 months. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments related to the additional $78.2 million in liabilities due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. (4) Other contractual obligations consist of an acquisition related escrow amount of $2.3 million, a joint development agreement requiring quarterly payments of $3.5 million through January 2010, a software subscription for $22.7 million requiring payments through January 2011, and a data center hosting agreement for $26.4 million, requiring payment through April 2013. Guarantees We have entered into agreements with some of our customers that contain indemnification provisions relating to potential situations where claims could be alleged that our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of a third party. Other guarantees or indemnification arrangements include guarantees of product and service performance and standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities. We have not recorded a liability related to these indemnification and guarantee provisions, and our guarantees and indemnification arrangements have not had any significant impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 54 Table of Contents Stock Repurchase Activities In 2008, we repurchased $604.7 million or 25.1 million shares of common stock, under the following two stock repurchase programs authorized by our Board: Under the $2.0 billion stock repurchase program approved in 2006 and 2007 (the 2006 Stock Repurchase Program), we repurchased approximately 15.4 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $24.53 per share for a total purchase price of $376.8 million during 2008. As of December 31, 2008, we have repurchased and retired approximately 84.8 million shares of our common stock under the 2006 Stock Repurchase Program at an average price of $23.58 per share, and the program had no remaining authorized funds available for future stock repurchases. The Board approved another $1.0 billion stock repurchase program in March 2008 (the 2008 Stock Repurchase Program). Under this program, we repurchased approximately 9.7 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $23.43 per share for a total purchase price of $227.9 million in 2008. As of December 31, 2008, the 2008 Stock Repurchase Program had remaining authorized funds of $772.1 million. All shares of common stock purchased under the 2006 and 2008 Stock Repurchase Programs have been retired. Future share repurchases under our 2008 Stock Repurchase Program will be subject to a review of the circumstances in place at the time and will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. This program may be discontinued at any time. See Note 14 Subsequent Events in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for discussion of our stock repurchase activity in 2009. Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements Liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our operating activities as well as acquisitions and investments in strategic relationships we may make in the future. Additionally, if we were to repurchase additional shares of our common stock under our 2008 Stock Repurchase Program, our liquidity may be impacted. We also have a substantial portion of our cash and investment balances held overseas and may be subject to U.S. taxes if repatriated. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short term and long term investments, together with cash generated from operations and cash generated from the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan will be sufficient to fund our operations, debt, and growth for at least the next 12 months. We believe our working capital is sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for capital expenditures, commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations during the same period. However, our future liquidity and capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending on many factors, including: the overall levels of sales of our products and gross profit margins; our business, product, capital expenditures, and research and development plans; the market acceptance of our products; repurchases of our common stock; issuance and repayment of debt; litigation expenses, settlements, and judgments; volume price discounts and customer rebates; the levels of accounts receivable that we maintain; acquisitions of other businesses, assets, products, or technologies; changes in our compensation policies; capital improvements for new and existing facilities; 55 Table of Contents technological advances; our competitors responses to our products; our relationships with suppliers, partners, and customers; possible future investments in raw material and finished goods inventories; expenses related to our future restructuring plans, if any; tax expense associated with stock based awards; issuance of stock based awards and the related payment in cash for withholding taxes in the current year and possibly during future years; the level of exercises of stock options and stock purchases under our equity incentive plans; and general economic conditions and specific conditions in our industry and markets, including the effects of disruptions in global credit and financial markets, international conflicts, and related uncertainties. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. In addition, a portion of our cash and marketable securities are held in non U.S. domiciled countries. Our marketable securities are generally classified as available for sale and, consequently, are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings of our investment portfolio. We do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures. The following tables present hypothetical changes in fair value of the financial instruments held at December 31, 2008, and 2007, that are sensitive to changes in interest rates (in millions): Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Valuation of Securities Given an Rate Decrease of X Basis Points Fair Value as of Interest (BPS) December 31, Rate Increase of X BPS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 2008 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS Government treasury and agencies $ 117.1 $ 116.6 $ 116.2 $ 115.7 $ 115.2 $ 114.8 $ 114.3 Corporate bonds and notes 83.1 82.6 82.0 81.5 81.0 80.4 79.9 Other 477.8 477.6 477.5 477.3 477.2 477.0 476.9 Total $ 678.0 $ 676.8 $ 675.7 $ 674.5 $ 673.4 $ 672.2 $ 671.1 Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Valuation of Securities Given an Rate Decrease of X Basis Points Fair Value as of Interest (BPS) December 31, Rate Increase of X BPS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 2007 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS Government treasury and agencies $ 68.4 $ 68.1 $ 67.7 $ 67.4 $ 67.0 $ 66.7 $ 66.3 Corporate bonds and notes 108.3 107.5 106.7 105.9 105.1 104.3 103.5 Asset backed securities and other 370.3 370.1 370.0 369.9 369.7 369.6 369.5 Total $ 547.0 $ 545.7 $ 544.4 $ 543.2 $ 541.8 $ 540.6 $ 539.3 56 Table of Contents These instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading. The modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (BPS), 100 BPS, and 150 BPS, which are representative of the historical movements in the Federal Funds Rate. Foreign Currency Risk and Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts Periodically, we use derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the re measurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies. These derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other income (expense) in the same period as the changes in the fair value from the re measurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. These foreign exchange contracts have maturities between one and two months. Our sales and costs of revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Our operating expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the British Pound, the Euro, Indian Rupee, and Japanese Yen. Periodically, we use foreign currency forward and or option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to operating expenses. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of less than one year. The effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and, upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction, is subsequently reclassified into the line item in the consolidated statements of operations to which the hedged transaction relates. We record any ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments, which was immaterial during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, in other income (expense) on our consolidated statements of operations. The increase in operating expenses including research and development, sales and marketing, as well as general and administrative expenses, due to foreign currency fluctuations was approximately 1% in 2008. Equity Price Risk Our portfolio of publicly traded equity securities is inherently exposed to equity price risk as the stock market fluctuates. We monitor our equity investments for impairment on a periodic basis. In the event that the carrying value of the equity investments exceeds its fair value, and we determine the decline in value to be other than temporary, we reduce the carrying value to its current fair value. In 2008, we realized an impairment charge of $3.5 million on a publicly traded equity security due to a sustained decline in the fair value, in excess of six months, of the investment below its cost basis that we judged to be other than temporary. We do not purchase our equity securities with the intent to use them for trading or speculative purposes. The aggregate fair value of our marketable equity securities was $4.4 million and $8.6 million as of December 31, 2008, and 2007, respectively. A hypothetical 30% adverse change in the stock prices of our portfolio of publicly traded equity securities would result in an immaterial loss. In addition to publicly traded securities, we have also invested in privately held companies. These investments are carried at cost. In 2008, we realized an impairment charge of $11.3 million on minority equity investments in privately held companies that we judged to be other than temporary. The aggregate cost of our investments in privately held companies was $14.2 million and $23.3 million as of December 31, 2008, and 2007, respectively. 57 Table of Contents
