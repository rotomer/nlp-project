ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This Annual Report on Form 10 K (Report), including the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward looking statements regarding future events and the future results of Juniper Networks, Inc. (the Company) that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the industry in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management. Words such as expects, anticipates, targets, goals, projects, would, could, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. These forward looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this Report under the section entitled Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I and elsewhere, and in other reports we file with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Form 10 Q. While forward looking statements are based on reasonable expectations of our management at the time that they are made, you should not rely on them. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason. The following discussion is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). In the course of operating our business, we routinely make decisions as to the timing of the payment of invoices, the collection of receivables, the manufacturing, and shipment of products, the fulfillment of orders, the purchase of supplies, and the building of inventory and spare parts, among other matters. Each of these decisions has some impact on the financial results for any given period. In making these decisions, we consider various factors including contractual obligations, customer satisfaction, competition, internal and external financial targets and expectations, and financial planning objectives. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosure of contingencies. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to sales returns, pricing credits, warranty costs, allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long term assets, especially goodwill and intangible assets, contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges, assumptions used in the valuation of stock based compensation, and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. To aid in understanding our operating results for the periods covered by this report, we have provided an executive overview and a summary of the significant events that affected the most recent fiscal year and a discussion of the nature of our operating expenses. These sections should be read in conjunction with the more detailed discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in this Item 7, our Risk Factors section included in Item 1A of Part I, and our audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in Item 8 of Part II of this report. Changes to Previously Announced Fiscal 2009 Fourth Quarter and U.S. GAAP Annual Results Subsequent to the January 28, 2010 announcement of our preliminary fourth quarter and full fiscal year results for 2009, we recorded additional litigation settlement charges of $169.3 million in our reported results. On February 5, 2010, we entered into a proposed agreement in principle to the federal securities class action litigation pending against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors relating to our historical stock option granting practices. This litigation settlement charge resulted in an increase in total operating expense and a reduction in operating income, income before income taxes and noncontrolling interest, provision for income taxes, consolidated net income, net income attributable to Juniper Networks, and net income per share attributable to Juniper Networks. See further discussion in Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies, under Legal Proceedings in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 32 Table of Contents Set forth below is a reconciliation of the January 28, 2010 announcement of our preliminary results press release to amounts reported in this Annual Report on Form 10 K which reflects the above mentioned adjustment (in millions, except per share amounts): Three Months Ended December 31, 2009 Year Ended December 31, 2009 Reported in Reported in Previously Net Annual Report on Previously Net Annual Report on Announced Change Form 10 K Announced Change Form 10 K Litigation settlement charges $ 12.0 $ 169.3 $ 181.3 $ 13.0 $ 169.3 $ 182.3 Total operating expenses $ 449.7 $ 169.3 $ 619.0 $ 1,678.1 $ 169.3 $ 1,847.4 Operating income $ 175.1 $ (169.3 ) $ 5.8 $ 480.0 $ (169.3 ) $ 310.7 Income before income taxes and noncontrolling interest $ 173.2 $ (169.3 ) $ 3.9 $ 481.4 $ (169.3 ) $ 312.1 Provision for income taxes $ 44.1 $ (61.3 ) $ (17.2 ) $ 258.1 $ (61.3 ) $ 196.8 Consolidated net income $ 129.2 $ (108.1 ) $ 21.1 $ 223.3 $ (108.1 ) $ 115.2 Net income attributable to Juniper Networks $ 131.0 $ (108.1 ) $ 22.9 $ 225.1 $ (108.1 ) $ 117.0 Net income per share attributable to Juniper Networks: Basic $ 0.25 $ (0.21 ) $ 0.04 $ 0.43 $ (0.21 ) $ 0.22 Diluted $ 0.24 $ (0.20 ) $ 0.04 $ 0.42 $ (0.20 ) $ 0.22 Executive Overview Our performance for the fiscal year 2009 reflects the weakness in market demand for networking and security products, compared to the fiscal year 2008, primarily due to our customers reaction to the weakened global economy. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to the slowdown in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific (APAC) service provider market. While the global economy continues to challenge the marketplace, our portfolio selling strategy enabled us to expand our depth and breadth in the enterprise and service provider markets during the second half of 2009. As a result, the fourth quarter of 2009 was our strongest quarter in the enterprise market as well as in the service provider market in the U.S. In addition, we were able to navigate through challenging economic conditions by controlling operating costs while continuing to invest in innovation and customer satisfaction. The following table provides an overview of our key financial metrics for the years ended December 31, 2009, and 2008 (in millions, except per share amounts and percentages): 2009 2008 $ Change % Change Net revenues $ 3,315.9 $ 3,572.4 $ (256.5 ) (7 )% Operating income $ 310.7 $ 695.0 $ (384.3 ) (55 )% Percentage of net revenues 9.4 % 19.5 % Net income attributable to Juniper Networks $ 117.0 $ 511.7 $ (394.7 ) (77 )% Percentage of net revenues 3.5 % 14.3 % Net income per share attributable to Juniper Networks common stock holders: Basic $ 0.22 $ 0.96 $ (0.74 ) (77 )% Diluted $ 0.22 $ 0.93 $ (0.71 ) (76 )% 33 Table of Contents Net Revenues: Our net revenues decreased in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to reduced demand for our products particularly in the Infrastructure segment, which is consistent with the overall decline in the global economy, partially offset by an increase in service revenue from both the Infrastructure and SLT segments. Net revenues from enterprise customers increased 11% while net revenues from service providers decreased 14% in 2009, compared to 2008. Net revenues decreased in all regions in 2009 compared to 2008. Operating Income: Our operating income as well as operating margin as a percentage of net revenues decreased in 2009 compared to 2008. These decreases were, in large part, due to the decrease in revenues and an increase in litigation settlement charges, partially offset by our efforts to control expenses and improve operational efficiencies in 2009 compared to 2008. Net Income Attributable to Juniper Networks and Net Income Per Share Attributable to Juniper Networks Common Stock Holders: The decrease in net income attributable to Juniper Networks (net income) and net income per share attributable to Juniper Networks common stock holders (net income per share) in 2009 compared to 2008, is primarily due to a decrease in revenue, an increase in litigation settlement charges, and total non recurring income tax charges of $118.5 million incurred during 2009. Of the $118.5 million, $61.8 million related to the write off of certain net deferred tax assets resulting from a change in California income tax law, $52.1 million related to a change in the tax treatment of stock based compensation expense in transfer pricing arrangements for certain U.S. multinational companies due to a recent federal appellate court ruling and $4.6 million related to an investigation by the India tax authorities. Other Financial Highlights: Total deferred revenue increased $163.3 million in 2009, primarily due to the growth in our installed equipment base for maintenance and customer support contracts and an increase in channel inventory. In 2009, we repurchased approximately 20.7 million shares of our common stock under our 2008 Stock Repurchase Program, at an average price of $21.91 per share for a total purchase price of $453.5 million. Business and Market Environment We design, develop, and sell products and services that together provide our customers with high performance network infrastructure that creates responsive and trusted environments for accelerating the deployment of services and applications over a single network. We serve the high performance networking requirements of global service providers, enterprises, and research and public sector organizations that view the network as critical to their success. High performance networking is designed to provide fast, reliable, and secure access to applications and services at scale. We offer a high performance network infrastructure that includes IP routing, Ethernet switching, security, and application acceleration solutions, as well as partnerships designed to extend the value of the network and worldwide services and support designed to optimize customer investments. In 2009, we continued to deliver new and innovative, high performance network infrastructure solutions. We extended our Junos software platform to include Junos Space network application platform and Junos Pulse integrated, multi service network client. The launch of our next generation silicon, Trio, enables 3 D scaling and positions our MX series routers as a universal edge platform for the networking market. We announced the TX Matrix Plus, a multi chassis system for the T1600 core router, which in conjunction with the JCS12000 Control Plane System brings virtualization to the core of the Internet. Additionally, we announced a significant technological advance with 100 Gigabit Ethernet interface cards for our T1600 core router. We also delivered our Adaptive Threat Management solution, designed to help customers identify and respond to security incidents to help reduce overall risk. We introduced a new solution for the Intelligent Services Edge with the StreamScope eRM integrated video monitoring and analysis product, which is designed to enable customers to extend the capabilities of our M and MX series routers to enhance the quality of video services over cable, wireless, and Internet Protocol Television networks. Our Ethernet switching portfolio added the EX2200 switch platform, the EX8208, a modular switching platform, and the EX8216, a high capacity modular switching platform designed for deployment in large enterprise data centers. In addition, our next generation network infrastructure includes four new models of our SRX family of dynamic services gateways. We expanded our SRX family of dynamic services gateways with the introduction of 34 Table of Contents the SRX3000, and extended the infrastructure for enterprises and started shipping the SRX100 dynamic service gateway platforms. Our SRX services gateways are sold into service provider and mobile packet core security markets as well as the enterprise market. On the partnership front, we announced entry into OEM agreements with Dell to offer our networking solutions under Dells PowerConnect brand, and with IBM to resell our Ethernet networking products and support to IBMs data center customers. In addition we entered in to a joint venture with Nokia Siemens Networks B.V. (NSN) to develop and resell joint carrier Ethernet solutions. The recent weakness in the global economy has affected the purchasing behavior of our customers, particularly among service providers, and caused delays or reductions in purchase decisions, which led to lower revenues in 2009 compared to 2008, as well as limited visibility regarding future business. If economic growth in the U.S. and other countries economies declines and or fails to recover, our customers may further delay or reduce their purchases, which could result in reductions in sales of our products, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies, and increased price competition. We continue to plan to both invest in key RD projects that we believe will lead to future growth and remain focused on continuing our efforts to contain other costs and allocate resources effectively. Nature of Expenses Most of our manufacturing, repair, and supply chain operations are outsourced to independent contract manufacturers. Accordingly, most of our cost of revenues consists of payments to our independent contract manufacturers for standard product costs. The independent contract manufacturers produce our products using design specifications, quality assurance programs, and standards that we establish. Our independent contract manufacturers manufacture our products primarily in China, Malaysia, Mexico, and the United States. We have employees in our manufacturing and operations organization who manage relationships with our contract manufacturers, manage our supply chain, and monitor product testing and quality. As of December 31, 2009, and 2008, we had 244 and 230 employees, respectively, in our manufacturing and operations organization that primarily manage relationships with our contract manufacturers, manage our supply chain, and monitor and manage product testing and quality. We generally do not own the components and title to products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon shipment. The contract manufacturers procure components based on our build forecasts, and if actual component usage is lower than our forecasts, we may be, and have been in the past, liable for carrying or obsolete material charges. In recent years, an increasing amount of our products has been manufactured in Asia, and we anticipate that a larger percentage of our products will be produced outside the U.S in the future. Our contracts generally provide for passage of title and risk of loss at the designated point of shipment to our customer. The manufacturing of products in Asia for shipment to customers in EMEA and the Americas resulted in additional shipment logistics, freight, and timing issues for us as well as those customers. In an ongoing effort to balance our and our customers needs, we have made changes on occasion to the payment of freight and the point of shipment with respect to products shipped from Asia. These changes affect shipping costs and the timing of revenue recognition of those shipments. Our operating expenses include RD, sales and marketing, and GA expenses. RD expenses include costs of developing our products from components to prototypes to finished products, costs for outside services such as certifications of new products, and expenditures associated with equipment used for testing. Several components of our RD effort require significant expenditures, such as the development of new components and the purchase of prototype equipment, the timing of which can cause quarterly variability in our expenses. We expense our RD costs as they are incurred. Sales and marketing expenses include costs for selling and promoting our products and services, demonstration equipment, and advertisements. These costs vary quarter to quarter depending on revenues, product launches, and marketing initiatives. We have an extensive distribution channel in place that we use to target new customers and increase sales. We have made substantial investments in our distribution channel during 2009, 2008, and 2007. GA expenses include professional fees, bad debt provisions, and other corporate expenses. Professional fees include legal, audit, tax, accounting, and certain corporate strategic services. 35 Table of Contents Employee related costs have historically been the primary driver of our cost of service revenue and operating expenses, and we expect this trend to continue. Employee related costs include items such as wages, commissions, bonuses, vacation, benefits, stock based compensation, and travel. We had 7,231, 7,014, and 5,879 employees as of December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The year over year increases were primarily attributable to increases in our RD and customer service organizations. Our headcount is expected to increase in 2010 as we continue to expand these functions. Facility and information technology (IT) departmental costs are allocated to other departments based on usage and headcount, respectively. Despite an increase in headcount in 2009, these costs decreased due to our cost reduction initiatives. Facilities and IT departmental costs increased in 2008 and 2007, due to increases in headcount and new facility leases added to support our growth. Facility and IT related headcount was 294, 267, and 224 as of December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. In 2010, we expect to continue to invest in our company wide IT infrastructure as we implement our operational excellence initiatives. Our cost of service revenues and operating expenses are denominated in U.S. Dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the British Pound, the Euro, Indian Rupee, and Japanese Yen. Changes in related currency exchange rates may affect our operating results. Periodically, we use foreign currency forward and or option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to cost of service revenues and operating expenses. The effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and, upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction, is subsequently reclassified into the appropriate line item of the consolidated statement of operations to which the hedged transaction relates. Any ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments is reported in other income (expense) on our consolidated statements of operations. The decrease in cost of service revenues and operating expenses including RD, sales and marketing, as well as GA expenses, due to foreign currency fluctuations was approximately 2% in 2009. The increase in cost of service revenues and operating expenses including RD, sales and marketing, as well as GA expenses, due to foreign currency fluctuations was approximately 1% and 2% in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Other Event Listing on the New York Stock Exchange On October 6, 2009, we submitted an application to transfer the listing of our Companys common stock to the NYSE from NASDAQ. Effective October 29, 2009, we transferred our listing from NASDAQ to the NYSE under the symbol JNPR. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, to determine the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The critical accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies. To the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future consolidated results of operations may be affected. Revenue Recognition. Our products are generally integrated with software that is essential to the functionality of our equipment. Additionally, we provide unspecified upgrades and enhancements related to our integrated software through our maintenance contracts for most of our products. Accordingly, we account for revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 985 605, Software Revenue Recognition (formerly, Statement of Position No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition). 36 Table of Contents Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met: Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. We generally rely upon sales contracts, or agreements and customer purchase orders, to determine the existence of an arrangement. Delivery has occurred. We use shipping terms and related documents or written evidence of customer acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery or performance. In instances where we have outstanding obligations related to product delivery or the final acceptance of the product, revenue is deferred until all the delivery and acceptance criteria have been met. Sales price is fixed or determinable. We assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. Collectability is reasonably assured. We assess collectability based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by our credit checks and the customers payment history. We record accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts, estimated customer returns, and pricing credits. For arrangements with multiple elements, such as sales of products that include services, we allocate revenue to each element using the residual method based on the vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value of the undelivered items. Under the residual method, the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements. VSOE of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately. We then recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with our policies for product and service revenue recognition. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable range based on historical discounting trends for specific products and services. If VSOE of fair value of one or more undelivered items does not exist, revenue is deferred and recognized at the earlier of (i) delivery of those elements or (ii) when fair value can be established unless maintenance is the only undelivered element, in which case, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the contractual support period. We account for multiple agreements with a single customer as one arrangement if the contractual terms and or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single arrangement. Our ability to recognize revenue in the future may be affected if actual selling prices are significantly less than fair value. In addition, our ability to recognize revenue in the future could be impacted by conditions imposed by our customers. For sales to direct end users, value added resellers, and OEM partners, we recognize product revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss, which is generally upon shipment. It is our practice to identify an end user prior to shipment to a value added reseller or to an OEM partner. For our end users and value added resellers, there are no significant obligations for future performance such as rights of return or pricing credits. Our agreements with our OEM partners may allow future rights of returns or pricing credits. A portion of our sales is made through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits or rights of return. We recognize product revenue on sales made through these distributors upon sell through as reported to us by the distributors. Deferred revenue on shipments to distributors reflects the effects of distributor pricing credits and the amount of gross margin expected to be realized upon sell through. Deferred revenue is recorded net of the related product costs of revenue. We record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments, such as rebates and price protection, in the same period that the related revenue is recorded. The amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns and price protection credits, specific criteria included in rebate agreements, and other factors known at the time. Should actual product returns or pricing adjustments differ from our estimates, additional reductions to revenue may be required. In addition, we report revenue net of sales taxes. Service revenues include revenue from maintenance, training, and professional services. Maintenance is offered under renewable contracts. Revenue from maintenance service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the contractual support period, which is generally one to three years. Revenue from training and professional services is recognized as the services are completed or ratably over the contractual period, which is generally one year or less. 37 Table of Contents We sell certain interests in accounts receivable on a non recourse basis as part of a customer financing arrangement primarily with one major financing company. We record cash received under this arrangement in advance of revenue recognition as short term debt. Contract Manufacturer Liabilities. We outsource most of our manufacturing, repair, and supply chain management operations to our independent contract manufacturers and a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of payments to them. Our independent contract manufacturers procure components and manufacture our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts are based on our estimates of future demand for our products, which are in turn based on historical trends and an analysis from our sales and marketing organizations, adjusted for overall market conditions. We establish a provision for inventory, carrying costs, and obsolete material exposures for excess components purchased based on historical trends. If the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecasted, which may be caused by factors outside of our control, it could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability. Supply chain management remains an area of focus as we balance the risk of material obsolescence and supply chain flexibility in order to reduce lead times. Warranty Costs. We generally offer a one year warranty on all of our hardware products and a 90 day warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the products. We accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs, labor costs for customer support, and overhead at the time revenue is recognized. Material cost is estimated primarily based upon the historical costs to repair or replace product returns within the warranty period. Technical support labor and overhead cost are estimated primarily based upon historical trends in the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period. Although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, use of materials, technical labor costs, and associated overhead incurred. Should actual product failure rates, use of materials, or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, we may incur additional warranty costs, which could reduce gross margin. Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets. We make significant estimates and assumptions when evaluating impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis, as well as when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity. The amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense. The value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, could be impacted by future adverse changes such as: (i) future declines in our operating results, (ii) a sustained decline in our market capitalization, (iii) significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or the networking industry, or (iv) failure to meet our forecasted operating results. We evaluate these assets on an annual basis as of November 1 or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis. Impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting units carrying value, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value of our reporting units based on market multiples of revenue or earnings for comparable companies. Under the income approach, we calculate fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference. We performed impairment test for our goodwill as of November 1, 2009, 2008 and 2007, and concluded that there was no goodwill impairment, or reporting units at risk of failing the first step of the impairment test. Intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. An asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future net cash flow the asset is expected to generate. If an asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. 38 Table of Contents We assess the recoverability of our intangible assets by determining whether the unamortized balances are greater than the sum of undiscounted future net cash flows of the related assets. The amount of impairment, if any, is measured based on projected discounted future net cash flows. The estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business. If our actual results or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets, we could incur additional impairment charges. Stock Based Compensation. We recognize stock based compensation expense for all share based payment awards including employee stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), performance share awards, and purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 (formerly, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123(R))). Stock based compensation expense for expected to vest stock based awards is valued under the single option approach and amortized on a straight line basis, net of estimated forfeitures. We utilize the Black Scholes Merton (BSM) option pricing model in order to determine the fair value of stock based awards. The BSM model requires various highly subjective assumptions including volatility, expected option life, and risk free interest rate. The expected volatility is based on the implied volatility of market traded options on our common stock, adjusted for other relevant factors including historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock options. The expected life of an award is based on historical experience, the terms and conditions of the stock awards granted to employees, as well as the potential effect from options that have not been exercised at the time. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent managements best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of managements judgment. If factors change and we use different assumptions, our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those expected to vest shares. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, our recorded stock based compensation expense could be different. Income Taxes. Estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences and carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income based on the realization criteria set forth in FASB ASC Topic Income Taxes (FASB ASC Topic 740) (formerly, SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes and Financial Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109). To the extent that we believe any amounts are not more likely than not to be realized, we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets. We believe it is more likely than not that future income from the reversal of the deferred tax liabilities and forecasted income will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event we determine that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Similarly, if we subsequently realize deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation allowance would be reversed, resulting in an adjustment to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize and measure potential liabilities based upon criteria set forth in FASB ASC Topic 740. Based upon these criteria, we estimate whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities may result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimate of tax liabilities is less than the amount ultimately assessed, a further charge to expense would result. Significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our 39 Table of Contents determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, as occurred in connection with the California tax law change in the first quarter of 2009, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding effect to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. For further discussion of the California tax law change refer to Note 12, Income Taxes, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Significant judgment is also required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions under FASB ASC Topic 740 and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves under FASB ASC Topic 740 are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made as it was during the second quarter of 2009, when we recorded a non recurring income tax charge as a result of a federal appellate court ruling in Xilinx, Inc. v. Commissioner. The provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserves under FASB ASC Topic 740 and any changes to the reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties, if applicable. Loss Contingencies. We are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset, or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We record a charge equal to the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the range of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required. From time to time, we are involved in disputes, litigation, and other legal actions. We are aggressively defending our current litigation matters. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and these actions or other third party claims against us may cause us to incur costly litigation and or substantial settlement charges. In addition, the resolution of any future intellectual property litigation may require us to make royalty payments, which could adversely affect gross margins in future periods. If any of those events were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected. The actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses.

Our net service revenues increased in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to the increase in professional services and maintenance revenue from our expanding installed base of equipment under service contracts. Our net product revenues increased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to increased sales of products from both our Infrastructure and SLT solutions to the service provider and enterprise markets. In particular, we had success in selling our Infrastructure products to service providers who are adopting next generation IP networks, which are designed for higher capacity and efficiency to help reduce total operating costs and to be able to offer multiple services over a single network. In 2008, our new product releases and further expansion into emerging markets contributed to the increase in total net product revenues. Our net service revenues increased in 2008, compared to 2007, primarily due to the increase in maintenance revenue from our expanding installed base of equipment under service contracts. Infrastructure Segment Revenues Our Infrastructure segment consists primarily of products and services related to the E , M , MX , and T series router product families, EX series switching products, as well as circuit to packet products.

In 2009, we experienced a 23% decrease in product revenue from the service provider market and a 40% increase in product revenue from the enterprise market compared to the same period in 2008. The decrease in the service provider market was primarily due to decreased capital spending in that market, and the increase in the enterprise market was primarily due to the growth in our EX series switching business and our continued focus on selling Infrastructure products into the enterprise market, which resulted in growth of enterprise revenues in Americas and APAC. Geographically, Infrastructure product revenue decreased in all three regions in 2009. Infrastructure product revenues increased in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily attributable to revenue growth from our M MX and T series product families, from sales to both the service provider and enterprise markets due to our customers increased demand for network infrastructure solutions. To a lesser extent, our EX series products, which were introduced in the first quarter of 2008, and our E series products also contributed to the revenue growth in 2008. In 2008, we experienced a 28% increase in product revenue from the service provider market and a 59% increase in product revenue from the enterprise market compared to the same period in 2007. From a geographical perspective, in 2008, we experienced revenue growth in all three regions, with particular strength in the Americas region. We track Infrastructure chassis revenue units and ports shipped to analyze customer trends and indicate areas of potential network growth. Most of our Infrastructure product platforms are modular, with the chassis serving as the base of the platform. Each modular chassis has a certain number of slots that are available to be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces. The modules are the components through which the platform receives incoming packets of data from a variety of transmission media. The physical connection between a transmission medium and a module is referred to as a port. The number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the functionality and throughput offered by the module. Chassis revenue units represent the number of chassis on which revenue was recognized during the period. The following table presents Infrastructure revenue units and ports shipped: Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Unit Change % Change 2008 2007 Unit Change % Change Infrastructure chassis revenue units(1) 12,578 13,745 (1,167 ) (8 )% 13,745 11,195 2,550 23 % Infrastructure ports shipped(1) 437,278 397,907 39,371 10 % 397,907 225,452 172,455 76 % (1) Excludes modular and fixed configuration EX series switching products and circuit to packet products. Infrastructure chassis revenue units decreased in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to reduced customer demand because of the weakened global economy. The port shipments increased in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to an increase in the MX series products, which generally contain a higher number of ports per chassis. Infrastructure chassis revenue units increased in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to the product mix that favored higher capacity chassis revenue units, which was driven by bandwidth demand as our customers sought to expand capabilities in their networks and to offer differentiating, feature rich, multi play services that allow them to generate new sources of revenues. The port shipments also increased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to the increase in the overall number of chassis revenue units from richly configured T and M series router chassis revenue units shipped during the 2008 period. Infrastructure Service Infrastructure service revenues increased in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to an increase in our installed base of equipment being serviced and service renewals.

As a percentage of net revenues, sales and marketing expenses decreased in 2008 due to our focus on managing expenses and creating efficiency in our sales activities. Personnel related charges, consisting of salaries, commissions, bonus, fringe benefits, and stock based compensation expenses, increased $70.8 million, or 17%, to $497.2 million in 2008, primarily due to an 18% increase in headcount in our worldwide sales and marketing organizations, from 1,863 to 2,190 employees. Included in personnel related charges was an increase in commission expense of $5.3 million in 2008 compared to 2007, due to our higher net revenues. We also increased our investment in corporate and channel marketing efforts from the prior year. As our sales force grew, we also increased facilities and IT expenses related to the sales and marketing organizations in 2008 compared to 2007. GA expenses increased in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to an increase in personnel related expenses and outside professional services. As a percentage of net revenues, GA expenses decreased slightly in 2009 due to our focus on managing expenses. Personnel related charges, consisting of salaries, bonus, fringe benefits, and stock based compensation expenses, increased $7.2 million, or 10%, to $78.4 million in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to a 12% increase in headcount, from 350 to 393 employees, in our worldwide GA functions to support expected future growth of the business. Outside professional service fees increased in 2009 compared to 2008 as a result of increased legal fees. Additionally, facilities and IT expenses related to our GA infrastructure increased to support our growing business. GA expenses also increased in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to an increase in personnel related expenses and outside professional services. As a percentage of net revenues, GA expenses decreased slightly in 2008 due to our focus on managing expenses and growing revenues. Personnel related charges, consisting of salaries, bonus, fringe benefits, and stock based compensation expenses, increased $12.4 million, or 21%, to $71.2 million in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to a 20% increase in headcount in our worldwide GA functions, from 291 to 350 employees, to support the overall growth of the business. Outside professional service fees increased in 2008 compared to 2007, as a result of increased legal fees and business process re engineering costs. Additionally, facilities and IT expenses related to our GA infrastructure increased to support our growing business. Amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to certain purchased intangible assets reaching the end of their amortization period during the second quarter of 2009. Amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to a decrease in amortization expense as certain purchased intangible assets became fully amortized during the second quarter of 2008. We had no impairment against our goodwill or our purchased intangible assets in 2009. In 2008, we had no impairment against our goodwill and recognized an impairment charge of $5.0 million against our purchased intangible assets, as a result of the phase out of our DX products. We had no impairment against our goodwill or our purchased intangible assets in 2007. 48 Table of Contents In 2009, we recorded litigation settlement charges of $182.3 million, which included $169.0 million related to our agreement in principle reached in February 2010, to settle the securities class action litigation pending against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors, $13.0 million related to the resolution of a dispute in connection with certain real estate in Sunnyvale California purchased in 2000 and $0.3 million related to another settlement recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009. Of these amounts, $181.3 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009. In 2008, we recorded a litigation settlement loss of $9.0 million related to our shareholder derivative lawsuit. In 2007, we recognized a net litigation settlement gain of $5.3 million, which consisted of cash settlement proceeds of $6.2 million, net of the $0.9 million legal expense related to direct transaction costs incurred. See Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for more information. In 2009, we recorded restructuring charges of $19.5 million as a result of a restructuring plan to reduce our real estate portfolio and workforce in targeted areas of the Company. We expect to incur additional charges of approximately $8 million to $10 million relating to additional facilities and employee restructuring under the 2009 Restructuring Plan in 2010. There were no restructuring charges in 2008. In 2007, we recorded restructuring charges of $0.7 million, of which $1.1 million pertained to bonus accruals associated with past acquisitions, partially offset by a benefit of $0.4 million pertaining to net restructuring adjustments. See Note 6, Other Financial Information, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for more information regarding our restructuring liabilities. Other charges are summarized as follows: Stock Option Investigation Costs. There were no stock option investigation costs recorded in 2009 and 2008. We recorded expenses of $6.0 million in 2007 related to professional fees and other costs in connection with our investigation into historical stock option granting practices. Stock Option Amendment and Tax Related Charges. There were no stock option amendment and tax related charges recorded in 2009 and 2008. We recorded $8.0 million in operating expense during 2007 in relation to the amendment of stock options and to the payment of certain taxes and penalties associated with employee stock option exercises. Interest and Other Income, net, (Loss) Gain on Equity Investments, and Income Tax Provision The following table presents interest and other income, net, (loss) gain on equity investments, and income tax provision (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 $ Change % Change 2008 2007 $ Change % Change Interest and other income, net $ 6.9 $ 48.7 $ (41.8 ) (86 )% $ 48.7 $ 96.8 $ (48.1 ) (50 )% Percentage of net revenues 0.2 % 1.4 % 1.4 % 3.4 % (Loss) gain on equity investments (5.5 ) (14.8 ) 9.3 63 % (14.8 ) 6.7 (21.5 ) (321 )% Percentage of net revenues (0.2 )% (0.4 )% (0.4 )% 0.2 % Income tax provision 196.8 217.2 (20.4 ) (9 )% 217.2 149.8 67.4 45 % Percentage of net revenues 5.9 % 6.1 % 6.1 % 5.3 % Net interest and other income decreased in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to lower interest rates and an increase in customer financing charges during 2009. Net interest and other income decreased in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to lower interest rates during 2008. During 2009 and 2008, we recognized impairment losses of $5.5 million and $14.8 million, respectively, on our investments in privately held companies for changes in fair value that we believed were other than temporary. In 2007, one of the companies in which we had a privately held equity investment completed an initial public 49 Table of Contents offering (IPO). As a result, we realized a gain of $6.7 million during 2007 based upon the difference between the market value of our investment at the time of the IPO and our cost basis. Our effective tax rates were 63.1%, 29.8%, and 29.3% in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The increase in the overall rate in 2009 compared to 2008 and the federal statutory rate of 35%, was primarily due to the following income tax charges: (i) a $61.8 million discrete and other related charge that resulted from changes in California income tax laws that were enacted during 2009; (ii) a $52.1 million charge that resulted from a change in our unrecognized tax benefits related to share based compensation due to the uncertainty regarding the status of a decision reached by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Xilinx Inc. v. Commissioner; and (iii) a $4.6 million charge which related to an investigation by the India tax authorities. The effective rate impact from these charges was partially offset by the federal RD credit and the benefit of earnings in foreign jurisdictions, which are subject to lower tax rates. The increase in the overall rate in 2008 compared to 2007, was primarily due to the differences in the geographic mix of our taxable income and the level of RD credits in the U.S. The 2008 and 2007 effective tax rates differ from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the federal RD credit and the benefit of earnings in foreign jurisdictions, which are subject to lower tax rates. For a complete reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and further explanation of our income tax provision, see Note 12, Income Taxes, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Segment Information For a description of the products and services for each segment, see Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. A description of the measures included in management operating income can also be found in Note 11, Segment Information, in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We have included segment financial data for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009, for comparative purposes. 50 Table of Contents Financial information for each segment used by management to make financial decisions and allocate resources is as follows (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 $ Change % Change 2008 2007 $ Change % Change Net revenues: Infrastructure: Product $ 1,959.2 $ 2,301.9 $ (342.7 ) (15 )% $ 2,301.9 $ 1,753.2 $ 548.7 31 % Service 482.4 424.0 58.4 14 % 424.0 320.1 103.9 32 % Total Infrastructure revenues 2,441.6 2,725.9 (284.3 ) (10 )% 2,725.9 2,073.3 652.6 31 % Service Layer Technologies: Product 608.8 609.1 (0.3 ) N/M 609.1 573.8 35.3 6 % Service 265.5 237.4 28.1 12 % 237.4 189.0 48.4 26 % Total Service Layer Technologies revenues 874.3 846.5 27.8 3 % 846.5 762.8 83.7 11 % Total net revenues 3,315.9 3,572.4 (256.5 ) (7 )% 3,572.4 2,836.1 736.3 26 % Operating income: Infrastructure 541.4 806.0 (264.6 ) (33 )% 806.0 597.8 208.2 35 % Service Layer Technologies 127.0 65.8 61.2 93 % 65.8 5.8 60.0 N/M Total segment operating income 668.4 871.8 (203.4 ) (23 )% 871.8 603.6 268.2 44 % Other corporate(1) (7.9 ) 7.9 N/M (7.9 ) (7.9 ) N/M Total management operating income 668.4 863.9 (195.5 ) (23 )% 863.9 603.6 260.3 43 % Amortization of purchased intangible assets (15.4 ) (49.0 ) 33.6 (69 )% (49.0 ) (91.4 ) 42.4 (46 )% Stock based compensation expense (139.7 ) (108.1 ) (31.6 ) 29 % (108.1 ) (88.0 ) (20.1 ) 23 % Stock based payroll tax expense (0.8 ) (2.8 ) 2.0 (71 )% (2.8 ) (7.7 ) 4.9 (64 )% Litigation settlement charges (gain) (182.3 ) (9.0 ) (173.3 ) N/M (9.0 ) 5.3 (14.3 ) 270 % Restructuring charges (19.5 ) (19.5 ) N/M (0.7 ) 0.7 (100 )% Other charges(2) (14.0 ) 14.0 (100 )% Total operating income 310.7 695.0 (384.3 ) (55 )% 695.0 407.1 287.9 71 % Interest and other income, net 6.9 48.7 (41.8 ) (86 )% 48.7 96.8 (48.1 ) (50 )% (Loss) gain on equity investments (5.5 ) (14.8 ) 9.3 (63 )% (14.8 ) 6.7 (21.5 ) 321 % Income before income taxes and noncontrolling interest $ 312.1 $ 728.9 $ (416.8 ) (57 )% $ 728.9 $ 510.6 $ 218.3 43 % N/M Not meaningful.

Infrastructure Segment An analysis of the change in revenues for the Infrastructure segment, and the change in revenue units, can be found above in the section titled Net Revenues. Infrastructure segment operating income decreased in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to a decrease in revenues in M , T and E series product families due to reduced demand in the service provider market in reaction to the weak global economic environment, partially offset by revenue growth from EX series switching products as well as MX series products. Infrastructure product gross margin in absolute dollars and as a percentage Infrastructure revenue decreased in 2009, compared to 2008, primarily due to product mix and pricing. 52 Table of Contents In 2009, we continued to invest in RD efforts to expand our Infrastructure product portfolio and to continue our innovation of products. We will continue to make investments to expand our product features and functionality based upon the trends in the marketplace. RD expense as a percentage of Infrastructure net revenues increased in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to lower net revenues relative to expenses. Additionally, our sales and marketing expenses increased slightly as a percentage of Infrastructure net revenues in 2009 compared to 2008, as we increased our efforts to reach enterprise and service provider customers. We allocate sales and marketing, GA, as well as facility and IT expenses to the Infrastructure segment generally based upon revenue, usage, and headcount. Infrastructure segment operating income increased in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to revenue growth from our router product families and, to a lesser extent, our new Ethernet switching product family, which outpaced expense growth. Infrastructure product gross margin increased in absolute dollars in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to revenues from richly configured high end T and M series router products as well as high margin port shipments. The Infrastructure gross margin percentage decreased slightly in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to product mix, particularly from an increase in the mix of lower margin E series products in 2008. SLT Segment An analysis of the change in revenues for the SLT segment, and the change in units, can be found above in the section titled Net Revenues. SLT segment operating income increased in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to the 3% growth in SLT revenues driven by product and service revenue increases, while lowering expenses through cost control initiatives and engineering effectiveness measures. SLT gross margin in absolute dollars and as a percentage of SLT revenue increased in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to an increase in service margin. RD related costs as a percentage of SLT net revenues decreased in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to our cost control initiatives and the growth in net revenues relative to expenses. Additionally, sales and marketing expenses also decreased as a percentage of SLT net revenues in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to the growth in SLT net revenues and reductions in discretionary spending. We allocate sales and marketing, general and administrative, as well as facility and information technology expenses to the SLT segment generally based on revenue, usage, and headcount. In the past, we have generally experienced quarterly seasonality and fluctuations in the demand for our SLT products, particularly in the fourth quarter, which may result in greater variations in our quarterly operating results. SLT segment operating income increased in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to revenue growth in our Firewall and J series products and the growth in our installed equipment base for service contracts, which outpaced the increase in SLT expenses. SLT product gross margin and gross margin percentage increased in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to product mix, particularly from an increase in the mix of higher margin Firewall and J series products in 2008. Stock Based Compensation and Related Payroll Taxes Stock based compensation expense increased in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily attributable to new stock option and RSU grants during 2009 and an increase in performance based RSU grants as a result of the strong operating results in the fourth quarter of 2009. Stock based compensation related payroll tax expense, which represents employment taxes we incurred in connection with our employee stock programs, decreased in 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease in payroll tax expense was primarily attributable to the timing and lower volume of stock options exercises by our employees in 2009 due to the lower share price during the year. Stock based compensation expense increased in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to new stock options and RSU grants during 2008 and the timing of the recognition of stock based compensation expense for RSUs granted in the last month of the fourth quarter of 2007. Stock based compensation related payroll tax expense decreased in 2008 compared to 2007, as a result of the decrease in our share price during 2008. For discussion of amortization of purchased intangible assets, litigation settlement charges (gain), restructuring charges, other charges, interest and other income, net, and (loss) gain on equity investments, refer to 53 Table of Contents Operating Expenses and Interest and Other Income, net, (Loss) Gain on Equity Investments and Income Tax Provision sections above. Key Performance Measures In addition to the financial metrics included in the consolidated financial statements, we use the following key performance measures to assess operating results: Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Days sales outstanding (DSO)(1) 44 42 42 Book to bill ratio(2) 1 1 1 (1) DSO is calculated as the ratio of ending accounts receivable, net of allowances, divided by average daily net sales for the preceding 90 days. (2) Book to bill ratio represents the ratio of product orders booked divided by product revenues during the respective period. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following sections discuss the effects of changes in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flows, contractual obligations, and our stock repurchase program on our liquidity and capital resources. Overview Historically, we have funded our business primarily through our operating activities and, to a lesser extent, the issuance of our common stock. The following table shows our capital resources (in millions, except percentages): As of December 31, 2009 2008 $ Change % Change Working capital $ 1,503.2 $ 1,759.6 $ (256.4 ) (15 )% Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,604.7 $ 2,019.1 $ (414.4 ) (21 )% Short term investments 570.5 172.9 397.6 230 % Long term investments 483.5 101.4 382.1 377 % Total cash, cash equivalents, and investments $ 2,658.7 $ 2,293.4 $ 365.3 16 % The significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, and accounts receivable, reduced by accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and deferred revenue. The decrease in working capital from December 31, 2008, to December 31, 2009, is primarily due to the increase in short term deferred revenue, partially offset by the increase in short term investments. Total cash, cash equivalents, and investments increased in 2009, primarily due to net cash generated from operations, partially offset by cash used in our common stock repurchases and fixed asset investments. Stock Repurchase Activities In March 2008, the Board approved the 2008 Stock Repurchase Program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our Companys common stock. Under this program, we repurchased 20.7 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $21.91 per share for a total purchase price of $453.5 million in 2009. As of December 31, 2009, the 2008 Stock Repurchase Program had remaining authorized funds of $318.6 million. In 2008, we repurchased $604.7 million or 25.1 million shares of common stock at an average price of $24.10 per share under the 2008 Stock Repurchase Program and the $2.0 billion stock repurchase program approved 54 Table of Contents in 2006 and 2007 (the 2006 Stock Repurchase Program). As of December 31, 2008, the 2006 Stock Repurchase Program had no remaining authorized funds available for future stock repurchases. All shares of common stock purchased under the 2006 and 2008 Stock Repurchase Programs have been retired. In addition, in February 2010, our Board approved a new stock repurchase program (the 2010 Stock Repurchase Program ) under which we are authorized to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our Companys common stock. Future share repurchases under our stock repurchase programs will be subject to a review of the circumstances in place at the time and will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. These programs may be discontinued at any time. See Note 16, Subsequent Events, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for discussion of our stock repurchase activity in 2010. Summary of Cash Flows In the year ended December 31, 2009, cash and cash equivalents decreased by $414.4 million. This decrease was the result of cash used in our investing and financing activities of $948.3 million and $262.2 million, respectively, partially offset by cash that was generated from our operating activities of $796.1 million. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $796.1 million, $875.2 million, and $786.5 million for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The cash provided by operating activities for each period was due to our consolidated net income adjusted by: Non cash charges of $299.5 million, $255.8 million, and $257.5 million for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. These non cash charges primarily related to depreciation and amortization expenses, stock based compensation, deferred income taxes, gain/loss on equity investments, and excess tax benefits from employee stock based compensation. Net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $381.3 million, $107.6 million, and $168.2 million for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, were generated in the normal course of business. These changes were primarily due to increases in deferred revenue, income tax payable, accrued compensation and other accrued liabilities, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable. The increase in deferred revenue was due to the increase in product revenue yet to be recognized and the growing installed base which resulted in additional support contracts. The increase in income taxes payable was due to the increase in the tax provision and the timing of payments. The increase in accrued compensation was due to our variable compensation and bonus program. The increase in other accrued liabilities was primarily due to the increase in the accrual for litigation settlements. In 2009, the Company accrued $169.0 million for a proposed settlement of our securities class action lawsuit reached in February 2010, which was paid prior to the filing of this report. These increases in cash flows from operations were partially offset by a negative cash flow due to an increase in net accounts receivable, which was primarily due to the growth in our business and net revenues. In 2008 and 2007, positive cash flows from operating assets and liabilities were due to increases in deferred revenue and income taxes payable. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $948.3 million for 2009 as compared to net cash generated by investing activities of $149.8 million in 2008. In 2007, cash generated by investing activities was $571.8 million. The changes between periods were primarily due to the movement of cash from short and long term investments to cash and cash equivalents as the result of the Companys investment strategy. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $262.2 million, $422.4 million, and $1,238.5 million for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. In 2009, we used $453.9 million to repurchase our common stock through our 2008 Stock Repurchase Program and, to a lesser extent, from our employees in connection with net issuance of shares to satisfy our tax withholding obligations for vesting of certain RSU and performance share awards, partially offset by cash proceeds of $164.2 million from common stock issued to employees and proceeds of $4.4 million from non 55 Table of Contents controlling interest. In 2008, we used $604.7 million for common stock repurchases, partially offset by cash proceeds of $119.5 million from common stock issued to employees. In 2007, we used $1,623.2 million to repurchase our common stock, partially offset by cash proceeds of $355.0 million from common stock issued to employees. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We had no off balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2009, and 2008. Contractual Obligations Our principal commitments primarily consist of obligations outstanding under operating leases, purchase commitments, tax liabilities, and other contractual obligations. The following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in millions): Less than More than Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Other Operating leases, net of committed subleases(1) $ 303.3 $ 51.0 $ 106.6 $ 60.2 $ 85.5 $ Purchase commitments(2) 139.5 139.5 Tax liabilities(3) 177.0 1.5 175.5 Other contractual obligations(4) 39.3 18.3 21.0 Total $ 659.1 $ 210.3 $ 127.6 $ 60.2 $ 85.5 $ 175.5 (1) Our contractual obligations under operating leases primarily relate to our leased facilities under our non cancelable operating leases. Rent payments are allocated to costs and operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. We occupy approximately 2.0 million square feet worldwide under operating leases. The majority of our office space is in North America, including our corporate headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. Our longest lease expires in November 2022. (2) In order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply, our contract manufacturers place non cancelable, non returnable (NCNR) orders for components based on our build forecasts. The contract manufacturers use the components to build products based on our forecasts and on purchase orders we have received from our customers. Generally, we do not own the components and title to the product transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon delivery at a designated shipment location. If the components go unused or the products go unsold for specified periods of time, we may incur carrying charges or obsolete materials charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders. As of December 31, 2009, we had accrued $27.8 million based on our estimate of such charges. Total purchase commitments as of December 31, 2009, consisted of $139.5 million NCNR orders. (3) Tax liabilities include the current and long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet for unrecognized tax positions. It is reasonably possible that we may reach agreement with certain tax authorities and, as a result, the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by approximately $1.5 million within the next 12 months. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments related to the additional $175.5 million in liabilities due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. (4) Other contractual obligations consists of an indemnity related escrow amount of $1.3 million, $19.1 million that remains unpaid under the data center hosting agreement with the remaining commitment expected to be paid through the end of April 2013, and $15.4 million that remains unpaid under the software subscription agreement with the remaining commitment expected to be paid through the end of January 2011, and $3.5 million that remains under the joint development agreement. 56 Table of Contents Guarantees We have entered into agreements with some of our customers that contain indemnification provisions relating to potential situations where claims could be alleged that our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of a third party. Other guarantees or indemnification arrangements include guarantees of product and service performance, guarantees related to third party customer financing arrangements and standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities. As of December 31, 2009, we had $34.0 million in guarantees and standby letters of credit and recorded a liability of $21.9 million related to a third party customer financing guarantee. As of December 31, 2008, we had not recorded a liability related to our guarantees and indemnification arrangements. Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements Liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our operating activities as well as acquisitions and investments in strategic relationships we may make in the future. Additionally, if we were to repurchase additional shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, our liquidity may be impacted. As of December 31, 2009, we have over 50% of our cash and investment balances held outside of the U.S., which may be subject to U.S. taxes if repatriated. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short term and long term investments, together with cash generated from operations and cash generated from the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan will be sufficient to fund our operations and anticipated growth for at least the next 12 months. We believe our working capital is sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for capital expenditures, commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations during the same period. However, our future liquidity and capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending on many factors, including: the overall levels of sales of our products, the mix of product sales, and gross profit margins; our business, product, capital expenditures, and RD plans; repurchases of our common stock; incurrence and repayment of debt; litigation expenses, settlements, and judgments, or similar items related to resolution of tax audits; volume price discounts and customer rebates; the levels of accounts receivable that we maintain; acquisitions of other businesses, assets, products, or technologies; changes in our compensation policies; capital improvements for new and existing facilities; our competitors responses to our products; our relationships with suppliers, partners, and customers; possible future investments in raw material and finished goods inventories; expenses related to our future restructuring plans, if any; tax expense associated with stock based awards; issuance of stock based awards and the related payment in cash for withholding taxes in the current year and possibly during future years; the level of exercises of stock options and stock purchases under our equity incentive plans; and general economic conditions and specific conditions in our industry and markets, including the effects of disruptions in global credit and financial markets, international conflicts, and related uncertainties. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. The value of our investments are subject to market price volatility. In addition, as of December 31, 2009, over 50% of our cash and marketable securities are held in non U.S. domiciled countries. Our marketable securities are generally classified as available for sale and, consequently, are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio. Conversely, a decline in interest rates could have a material impact on interest income from our investment portfolio. We do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures. We recognized immaterial gains and losses during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, related to the sales of our investments. The following tables present hypothetical changes in fair value of the financial instruments held at December 31, 2009, and 2008, that are sensitive to changes in interest rates (in millions): Valuation of Securities Given an Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Fair Value as of Interest Rate Decrease of X BPS December 31, Rate Increase of X BPS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 2009 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS Government treasury and agencies $ 461.3 $ 460.0 $ 458.7 $ 457.3 $ 456.1 $ 454.8 $ 453.4 Corporate bonds and notes 495.4 493.5 491.6 489.8 487.9 486.0 484.2 Foreign government debt securities 98.2 97.7 97.2 96.7 96.2 95.7 95.2 Other 1,099.7 1,099.7 1,099.7 1,099.7 1,099.6 1,099.6 1,099.6 Total $ 2,154.6 $ 2,150.9 $ 2,147.2 $ 2,143.5 $ 2,139.8 $ 2,136.1 $ 2,132.4 Valuation of Securities Given an Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Fair Value as of Interest Rate Decrease of X BPS December 31, Rate Increase of X BPS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 2008 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS Government treasury and agencies $ 160.1 $ 159.6 $ 159.1 $ 158.7 $ 158.2 $ 157.7 $ 157.3 Corporate bonds and notes 111.7 111.2 110.8 110.3 109.8 109.3 108.8 Other 1,651.2 1,651.0 1,650.8 1,650.6 1,650.4 1,650.3 1,650.1 Total $ 1,923.0 $ 1,921.8 $ 1,920.7 $ 1,919.6 $ 1,918.4 $ 1,917.3 $ 1,916.2 These instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading. The modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (BPS), 100 BPS, and 150 BPS, which are representative of the historical movements in the Federal Funds Rate. Foreign Currency Risk and Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts Periodically, we use derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the re measurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies. These derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other income (expense) in the same period as the changes in the 58 Table of Contents fair value from the re measurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. These foreign exchange contracts have maturities of approximately two months. Our sales and costs of product revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. Dollars. Our cost of service revenue and operating expenses are denominated in U.S. Dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the British Pound, the Euro, Indian Rupee, and Japanese Yen. Periodically, we use foreign currency forward and or option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to cost of service revenue and operating expenses. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of less than one year. The effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and, upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction, is subsequently reclassified into the line item in the consolidated statements of operations to which the hedged transaction relates. We record the ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments, which was immaterial during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, in other income (expense) on our consolidated statements of operations. The decrease in operating expenses including cost of service revenue, RD, sales and marketing, and GA expenses, due to foreign currency fluctuations was approximately 2% in 2009. In 2008 and 2007, the increase in cost of service revenue, operating expenses including RD, sales and marketing, and GA, due to foreign currency fluctuations was approximately 1% and 2%, respectively. Equity Price Risk Our portfolio of publicly traded equity securities is inherently exposed to equity price risk as the stock market fluctuates. We monitor our publicly traded equity investments for impairment on a periodic basis. In the event that the carrying value of a public traded equity investment exceeds its fair value, and we determine the decline in value to be other than temporary, we reduce the carrying value to its current fair value. In 2008, we realized an impairment charge of $3.5 million on a publicly traded equity security due to a sustained decline, in excess of six months, in the fair value of the investment below its cost basis that we judged to be other than temporary. There was no such charge in 2009. We do not purchase our publicly traded equity securities with the intent to use them for trading or speculative purposes. They are classified as available for sale securities on our consolidated balance sheets. The aggregate fair value of our marketable equity securities was $5.4 million and $4.4 million as of December 31, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Additionally, our non qualified deferred compensation (NQDC) plan may also hold publicly traded securities. Investments under the NQDC plan are considered trading securities and are reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2009, and 2008, the total investments under the NQDC plan was $4.7 million and $1.0 million, respectively. A hypothetical 30% adverse change in the stock prices of our portfolio of publicly traded equity securities would result in an immaterial loss. Our investments in privately held companies are carried at cost. In 2009 and 2008, we realized an impairment charge of $5.5 million and $11.3 million, respectively, on minority equity investments in privately held companies that we judged to be other than temporary as discussed in Note 4, Fair Value Measurements, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The aggregate cost of our investments in privately held companies was $13.9 million and $14.2 million as of December 31, 2009, and 2008, respectively. 59
