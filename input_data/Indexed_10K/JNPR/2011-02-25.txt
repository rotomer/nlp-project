ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This Annual Report on Form 10 K (Report), including the M anagements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward looking statements regarding future events and the future results of Juniper Networks, Inc. ("we," "us," or the Company) that are based on our current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about our business, our results of operations, the industry in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management. Words such as expects, anticipates, targets, goals, projects, would, could, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. These forward looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual results m ay differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this Report under the section entitled Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I and elsewhere, and in other reports we file with the SEC, specifically our most recent reports on Form 10 Q. While forward looking statements are based on reasonable expectations of our management at the time that they are made, you should not rely on them. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason. The following discussion is based upon our Co nsolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). In the course of operating our business, we routinely make decisions as to the timing of the payment of invoices, the collection of receivables, the manufacturing and shipment of products, the fulfillment of orders, the purchase of supplies, and the building of inventory and spare parts, among other matters. Each of these decisions has some impact on the financial results for any given period. In making these decisions, we consider various factors including contractual obligations, customer satisfaction, competition, internal and external financial targets and expectations, and financial planning objectives. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosure of contingencies. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to sales returns, pricing credits, warranty costs, allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long term assets, especially goodwill and intangible assets, contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges, assumptions used in the valuation of share based compensation, and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. For further information about our critical accounting policies and estimates, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this Annua l Report on Form 10 K, and our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section included in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. To aid in understanding our operating results for the periods covered by this Report, we have provided an executive overview and a summary of the business and market environment. These sections should be read in conjunction with the more detailed discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in this Item 7, our Risk Factors section included in Item 1A of Part I, and our audited consolida ted financial statements and notes included in Item 8 of Part II of this report. 29 Table of ContentsExecutive Overview In 2010, we experienced a year over year increase in net revenues across all regions and in both the enterprise and service provider markets. These increases reflect growing market demand for networking and security products as our customers expand their networks and the recovering global economy. Additionally, while our net revenues grew, we continued to control costs as we invested in our innovation and customer satisfaction initiatives. The following table provides an overview of our key financial metrics for the years ended December 31, 2010, and 2009 (in millions, except per share amounts and percentages): 2010 2009 $ Change % Change Net revenues$4,093.3 $3,315.9 $777.4 23%Operating income$767.6 $310.7 $456.9 147%Percentage of net revenues 18.8% 9.4%  Net income attributable to Juniper Networks$618.4 $117.0 $501.4 429%Percentage of net revenues 15.1% 3.5% Net income per share attributable to Juniper Networks common stockholders: Basic$1.18 $0.22 $0.96 436%Diluted$1.15 $0.22 $0.93 423% &bull; Net Revenues: Our net revenues increased across all three regions, in both the service provider and enterprise markets, in 2010 compared to 2009. These increases were primarily due to increased demand for our most recent product lines, the MX Series routers, EX Series switches, and SRX service gateways, and the improved macroeconomic env ironment. &bull; Operating Income: Our operating income as well as operating margin increased in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase was, in large part, due to the increase in sales, a change in customer demand that favored higher margin products, and our continued efforts to control expenses and improve efficiencies. Additionally, 2009 was impacted by $182.3 million in litigation settlement charges. &bull; Net Income Attributable to Juniper Netwo rks and Net Income Per Share Attributable to Juniper Networks Common Stock Holders: The increase in net income attributable to Juniper Networks and net income per share attributable to Juniper Networks common stockholders in 2010 compared to 2009 is primarily due to the increase in operating income and a non recurring income tax expense and benefit recorded in 2009 and 2010, respectively, from changes in the estimate of unrecognized tax benefits related to share based compensation. These changes were the result of decisions made by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Xilinx Inc. v. Commissioner. &bull; Stock Repurchase Activity: Under our stock repurchase programs, we repurchased approximately 19.7 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $28.67 per share for a total purchase price of $563.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2010. &bull; Other Financial Highlights: Total deferred revenue increased $130.8 million in 2010, primarily due to an increase in deferred product revenue from undelivered product commitments and an increase in deferred service revenue, largely due to higher sales of service contracts and multi year service billings. Business and Market Environment We design, develop, and sell products and services that together provide our customers with high performance network infrastructure that creates responsive and trusted environments for accelerating the deployment of services and applications over a single network. We serve the high performance networking requirements of global service providers, enterprises, governments, and research and public sector organizations that view the network as critical to their success. High performance networking is designed to provi de fast, reliable, and secure access to applications and services at scale. We offer a high performance network infrastructure that includes IP routing, Ethernet switching, security, software, and application acceleration solutions, as well as partnerships designed to extend the value of the network and worldwide services and support designed to optimize customer investments.30 Table of Contents In 2010, we experienced increased demand for our products and services due to growing network demand. As more traffic is carried over the Internet, computing is centralized in massive data centers and more people in businesses rely on digital devices connected to the network. Strategically, we are making progress toward our vision of the New Network by expanding our portfolio of products and solutions through organic growth and acquisitions, and aligning those products with mobile internet and cloud computing market trends. We continued to deliver new and innovative, high performance network infrastructure solutions in 2010. We expanded our portfolio of offerings for the enterprise market to provide a comprehensive portfolio of routing, switching, and security products that are running on our Junos&reg; operating system. We also launched our next generation data center architecture named 3 2 1, that enables customers to connect large numbers of data center servers and storage devices in a way that we believe improves the economics and the performance of these massive data centers. We announced and began shipping the EX4500, a data center switch that can leverage our Virtual Chassis technology to create a data center fabric across multiple networking devices and can o ffer up to 48 10 gigabit Ethernet (10GbE) ports. We began shipping the new EX2200 line of fixed configuration managed Ethernet switches that offers a plug and play solution that addresses access connectivity requirements of high performance businesses. We also announced and began shipping the EX8200 40XS line card that enables our modular switch EX8200 to deliver 40 10GbE ports per line card and the MX80 3D Universal Edge Router, powered by the Junos Trio chipset and designed for both service provider and enterprise deployments. We announced our latest fabric chipset that will enable customers to upgrade their existing T Series core routers. Additionally, we announced the SRX1400, a consolidated security services gateway for securing small to mid size enterprise, service provider and mobile operator data center environments, and the Dual Stack Light IPv6 migration tool that will allow service providers to handle IPv4 address exhaustion. Moreover, we announced the industrys fastest core routi ng platform, the T4000 Core Router powered by Junos, which provides scalability and flexibility to meet bandwidth requirements, while extending investment protection of our T Series platform. In the area of mobility, we announced and began shipping Junos Pulse, a gateway and downloadable client software for secure connections across mobile devices including notebooks, netbooks, smartphones, and tablets as well as non mobile devices to a broad range of corporate applications for a better, simpler experience for users. Additionally, we announced several new and expanded mobility partnerships intended to deliver software and solutions for mobile operators and improve experience and economics of their networks. In addition to our infrastructure and mobility products, we announced four new applications that will enable IT managers to orchestrate the automation and security of networks from a single user oriented management interface: (i) Juniper Virtual Control, a Junos Space based application to help data center customers manage their Juniper physical switches and VMware virtual switches; (ii) Juniper Ethernet Design, a unified Ethernet management application that enables the data center or campus network to dial up or down as needed in response to the needs of applications and users; (iii) Juniper Security Design, a software application that allows point and click turn up of both security devices and services; and (iv) Juniper Service Insight, a software application for proactive detection, diagnosis, and resolution of network performance is sues. In 2010, we completed the acquisitions of: (i) Ankeena Networks, Inc. (Ankeena), a privately held company, which gives us video delivery capabilities that optimize web based video delivery, provide key components of a content delivery network architecture/solution, improve consumers online video experience, and reduce service provider and carrier service provider infrastructure costs for providing web based video; (ii) SMobile Systems, Inc. (SMobile), a privately held software company, which allows us to extend our security focus through integration of SMobiles product portfolio with Junos Pulse; (iii) Altor Networks ("Altor"), a privately held company, which strengthens our ability to deliver an integrated, highly scalable security arch itecture that protects physical and virtual systems of enterprise and service provider customers; and (iv) Trapeze Networks, a subsidiary of Belden, Inc., which expands our Infrastructure product portfolio to include scalable, secure, and highly available wired and wireless infrastructure products. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, to determine the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the 31 Table of Contentspreparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The critical accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies. To the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future consolidated results of operations may be affected. &bull;Revenue recognition. Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met: &bull; Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. We generally rely upon sales contracts, or agreements and customer purchase orders, to determine the existence of an arrangement. &bull; Delivery has occurred. We use shipping terms and related documents or written evidence of customer acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery or performance. &bull; Sales price is fixed or determinable. We assess whether the sales price is fixed or deter minable based on the payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. &bull; Collectability is reasonably assured. We assess collectability based on the creditworthiness of customer as determined by our credit checks and their payment histories. We record accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts, estimated customer returns, and pricing credits. We adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2009 13, Topic 605 Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements (ASU 2009 13) and ASU No. 2009 14, Topic 985 Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements (ASU 2009 14) on a prospective basis as of the beginning of fiscal 2010 f or new and materially modified arrangements originating after December 31, 2009. Under the new standards, we allocate the total arrangement consideration to each separable element of an arrangement based on the relative selling price of each element. Arrangement consideration allocated to undelivered elements is deferred until delivery.For fiscal 2010 and future periods, pursuant to the guidance of ASU 2009 13, when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements, and software and non software components that function together to deliver the tangible products essential functionality, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) if available, third party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. We then recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with our policies for product and service revenue recognition.VSOE is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable range based on historical discounting trends for specific products and services. TPE of selling price is established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in stand alone sales to similarly situated customers. However, as our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and our solutions offer substantially different features and functionality, the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality typically cannot be obtained. Additionally, as we are unable to reliably determine what competitors products selling prices are on a stand alone basis, we are not typically able to determine TPE. When determining the best estimate of selling price, we apply management judgment by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, pricing practices in different geographies and through different sales channels, gross margin objectives, internal costs, competitor pricing strategies, and industry technology lifecycles.For transactions initiated prior to January 1, 2010, revenue for arrangements with multiple elements, such as sales of products that include services, is allocated to each element using the residual method based on the VSOE of fair value of the undelivered items pursuant to ASC Topic 985 605 Software Revenue Recognition. Under the residual method, the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements. If VSOE of fair value of one or more undelivered items does not exist, revenue from the entire arrangement is deferred and recognized at the earlier of (i) delivery of those elements or (ii) when fair value can be established unless maintenance is the only undelivered element, in which case, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the contractual support period.As a result of the adoption of ASU 2009 13 and ASU 2009 14, net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010, was approximately $237 million higher than the net revenue that would have been recorded under the previous 32 Table of Contentsaccounting rules. The increase in revenue was due to recognition of revenue for products shipped du ring the period which included approximately $183 million in the year ended December 31, 2010, related to undelivered product commitments for which we were unable to demonstrate fair value pursuant to the previous accounting standards. The remainder of the increase in revenue for the year was due to products sold into multiple year service arrangements which was recognized ratably under the previous accounting standards and for the change in our allocation methodology from the residual method to the relative selling price method as prescribed by ASU 2009 13.We cannot reasonably estimate the effect of adopting these standards on future financial periods as the impact will vary depending on the nature an d volume of new or materially modified arrangements in any given period as well as on changes in our business practices. However, as ASU 2009 13 and ASU 2009 14 would allow us to recognize revenue for the portion allocated to delivered items in multiple element arrangements and defer revenue for only the portion allocated to the undelivered items, we expect that the magnitude of deferrals related to undelivered product commitments and other items, for which we previously would not have been able to establish VSOE, will gradually decrease over time.We account for multiple agreements with a single customer as one arrangement if the contractual terms and or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single arrangement. Our ability to recognize revenue in the future may be affected if actual selling pric es are significantly less than fair value. In addition, our ability to recognize revenue in the future could be impacted by conditions imposed by our customers. For sales to direct end users, value added resellers, and original equipment manufacturers ("OEM") partners, we recognize product revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss, which is generally upon shipment. It is our practice to identify an end user prior to shipment to a value added reseller. For our end users and value added resellers, there are no significant obligations for future performance such as rights of return or pricing credits. Our agreements with OEM partners may allow future rights of returns. Additionally, a portion of our sales are made throu gh distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits or rights of return. We recognize product revenue on sales made through these distributors upon sell through as reported to us by the distributors. Deferred revenue on shipments to distributors reflects the effects of distributor pricing credits and the amount of gross margin expected to be realized upon sell through. Deferred revenue is recorded net of the related product costs of revenue. We record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments, such as rebates and price protection, in the same period that the related revenue is recorded. Managements judgment with respect to the amount of these reductions is based on historical s ales returns and price protection credits, specific criteria included in rebate agreements, and other factors known at the time. Should actual product returns or pricing adjustments differ from our estimates, additional reductions to revenue may be required. In addition, we report revenue net of sales taxes. Service revenues include revenue from maintenance, training, and professional services. Maintenance is offered under renewable contracts. Revenue from maintenance service contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual support period, which is generally one to three years. Revenue from training and professional services is recognized as the services are completed or ratably over the contractual perio d, which is generally one year or less. We sell certain accounts receivable on a non recourse basis as part of a customer financing arrangement primarily with one major financing company. We record cash received under this arrangement in advance of revenue recognition as short term debt. &bull; &n bsp; Contract Manufacturer Liabilities. We outsource most of our manufacturing, repair, and supply chain management operations to our independent contract manufacturers, and a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of payments to them. Our independent contract manufacturers manufacture our products primarily in China, Malaysia, Mexico, and the United States. We have employees in our manufacturing and operations organization who manage relationships with our independent contract manufacturers, manage our supply chain, and monitor product testing and quality. We generally do not own the components and title to products transfers from our independent contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon shipment. Our independent contract manufacturers produce our products using design specifications, quality assurance programs, and standards that we establish, and they procure components and manufacture our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts are our estimates of future demand for our products, based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and marketing organizations, adjusted for overall market conditions. We establish a provision for inventory, carrying costs, and obsolete material exposures for excess components purchased based on historical trends. If the actual component 33 Table of Contentsusage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast, which may be caused by factors outside of our control, we may incur charges for excess components, which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability. Supply chain management remains an area of focus as we balance the risk of material obsolescence and supply chain flexibility in order to reduce lead times. &bull; Warranty Costs. We generally offer a one year warranty on all of our hardware products and a 90 day warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the products. We accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs, labor costs for customer support, and overhead at the time revenue is recognized. Material cost is estimated primarily based upon the historical costs to repair or replace product returns within the warranty period. Technical support labor and overhead cost are estimated primarily based upon historical trends in the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period. Although we engage in extensive product quality programs and proce sses, if actual product failure rates, use of materials, or service delivery costs differ from estimates, additional warranty costs may be incurred, which could reduce gross margin. &bull; Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets. We make significant estimates and assumptions when evaluating impairment o f goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis, as well as when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity. The amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense. The value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, could be impacted by future adverse changes such as: (i) future declines in our operating results, (ii) a sustained decline in our market capitalization, (iii) significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or the networking industry, or (iv) failure to meet our forecasted operating results. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during analysis. We evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of November 1st or more frequently if we believe impairment indicators exist. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting units carrying value, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income and the market approaches. Under the income approach, we calculate fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value of our reporting units based on market multiples of revenue or earnings for comparable companies. If the fair value of the reportin g unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill. When the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, we record an impairment loss equal to the difference. Intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. An asset is considered imp aired if its carrying amount exceeds the future net cash flow the asset is expected to generate and the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. We assess the recoverability of our intangible assets by determining whether the unamortized balances are greater than the sum of undiscounted future net cash flows of the related assets. The amount of impairment, if any, is measured based on projected discounted future net cash flows. The estimates used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business. If our actual re sults or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets, we could incur additional impairment charges. &bull; Share Based Compensation. We recognize share based compensation expense for all share based payment awards includ ing employee stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), performance share awards ("PSAs"), and purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") in accordance with ASC Topic 718 Compensation Stock Compensation ("ASC Topic 718"). Share based compensation expense for expected to vest share based awards is valued under the single option approach and amortized on a straight line basis, net of estimated forfeitures. We utilize the Black Scholes Merton (BSM) option pricing model in order to determine the fair value of stock options. The BSM model requir es various highly subjective assumptions including volatility, expected option life, and risk free interest rate. The expected volatility is based on the implied volatility of market traded options on our common stock, adjusted for other relevant factors including historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock options. The expected life of an award is 34 Table of Contentsbased on historical experience, the terms and conditions of the stock awards granted to employees, and the potential effect from options that have not been exercised. We determine the fair value of RSUs and PSAs based on the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date. In addition, we estimate share based compensation expense for our PSAs based on the vesting criteria and only recognize expense for the portions in which annual targets have been set. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent managements best estimates. These estimates involve inherent u ncertainties and the application of managements judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those expected to vest shares. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, our recorded share based compensation expense could be different. &bull; Income Taxes. Estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income based on the realization criteria set forth in ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes (ASC Topic 740). To the extent that we believe any amounts are not more likely tha n not to be realized, we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets. We believe it is more likely than not that future income from the reversal of the deferred tax liabilities and forecasted income will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event we determine that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance is charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Similarly, if we subsequently realize deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation allowance is reversed, resulting in an adjustment to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize and measure potential liabilities based upon our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. Significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding effect to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. Significant judgment is also required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions under ASC Topic 740 and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves under ASC Topic 740 are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made, as it was during the first quarter of 2010 when we recorded a non recurring income tax benefit as a result of a taxpayer favorable federal appellate court ruling in Xilinx, Inc. v. Commissioner. The provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserves under ASC Topic 740 and any changes to the reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties, if applicable. &bull; Loss Contingencies. We are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset, or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We record a charge equal to the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the range of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information av ailable to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required. From time to time, we are involved in disputes, litigation, and other legal actions. We are aggressively defending our 35 Table of Contentscurrent litigation matters. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and these actions or other third party claims against us may cause us to incur costly litigation and or substantial settlement charges. In addition, the resolution of any future intellectual property litigation may require us to make royalty payments, which could adversely affect gross margins in future periods. If any of those events were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected. The actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses. For a discussion of current litigation, please see under the heading "Legal Proceedings" in Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2, Summary of Significant A ccounting Policies, in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on financial condition and results of operations, which is incorporated herein by reference. Results of Operations The following table presents product and service net revenues (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 $ Change % Change 2009 2008 $ Change % ChangeNet revenues:  Product$3,258.7 $2,568.0 $690.7 27% $2,568.0 $2,911.0 $(343.0) (12)%Percentage of net revenues 79.6% 77.4% 77.4% 81.5% Service834.6 747.9 86.7 12% 747.9 661.4 86.5 13 %Percentage of net revenues 20.4% 22.6% 22.6% 18.5% Total net revenues$4,093.3 $3,315.9 $777.4 23% $3,315.9 $3,572. 4 $(256.5) (7)% Our net product revenues increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in Infrastructure product sales to service provider and enterprise customers across all regions, Service Layer Technologies ("SLT") product sales to enterprise customers across all regions and SLT product sales to service provider customers in the Americas. The increased revenue was the result of increased demand for our most recent product lines, the MX Series routers, EX Series switches, and SRX service gateways, as well as the improved macroeconomic environment as compared to 2009. Additionally our net service revenues increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to an increase in sales to enterprise customers across all regions and to service provider customers in the EMEA and Asia Pacific ("APAC") regions, which was primarily driven by growth in the installed base and continued strength in contract renewals for support services. The year over year change also reflects an impact of approximately $237 million related to the the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting guidance described in the Critical Accounting Policies section above. Our net product revenues decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to decreased revenue from our routing products to service provider customers whose spending patterns were affected by the weakened global economy, partially offset by increased revenues from our EX Series switching products. Our net service revenues increased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to the increase in professional services and maintenance revenue from our expanding installed base of equipment under service contracts. 36 Table of ContentsInfrastructure Segment Revenues Our Infrastructure segment consists primarily of products and services related to the E, M, MX, and T Series router product families, EX Series switching products, as well as circuit to packet products. Additionally, the Infrastructure segment offers a complete wireless local area network ("WLAN") solution that provides high reliability, performance, security, and management for mobile applications. The following table presents net Infrastructure segment revenues and net Infrastructure segment revenues as a percentage of total net revenues by product and service categories (in millions, except percentages):  Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 $ Change % Change 2009 2008 $ Change % ChangeNet Infrastructure segment revenues:  Infrastructure product revenues$2,511.6 $1,959.2 $552.4 28% $1,959.2 $2,301.9 $(342.7) (15)%Percentage of net revenues 61.3% 59.1% 59.1% 64.4% Infrastructure service revenues538.7 482.4 56.3 12% 482.4 424.0 58.4 14 %Percentage of net revenues 13.2% 14.5% 14.5% 11.9%  Total Infrastructure segment revenues$3,050.3 $2,441.6 $608.7 25% $2,441.6 $2,725.9 $(284.3) (10)%Percentage of net revenues 74.5% 73.6% 73.6% 76.3% &n bsp; Infrastructure Product In 2010, Infrastructure products revenue experienced growth in the enterprise and service provider markets across all regions compared to 2009. This increase was primarily attributable to revenue growth from our MX Series routers and EX Series switches. The increased demand for our products was primarily due to growing network demand attributable to increased reliance on digital devices connected to the network, and to a lesser extent, the improved macroeconomic environment. Infrastructure product revenues decreased in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to decreased revenue from M, T, and E Series product families attributable to our customers reduced demand as a result of the global economic environment, partially offset by revenue growth f rom our EX Series switching products and MX Series products. We experienced a decrease in product revenue from the service provider market in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to decreased capital spending in that market. We experienced an increase in product revenue from the enterprise market in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to the growth in our EX Series switching business and our continued focus on selling Infrastructure products into the enterprise market, which resulted in growth of enterprise revenues in Americas and APAC. Geographically, Infrastructure product revenue decreased in all three regions in 2009. We track Infrastructure chassis revenue units and ports shipped to analyze customer trends and indicate areas of potential network grow th. Most of our Infrastructure product platforms are modular, with the chassis serving as the base of the platform. Each modular chassis has a certain number of slots that are available to be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces. The modules are the components through which the platform receives incoming packets of data from a variety of transmission media. The physical connection between a transmission medium and a module is referred to as a port. The number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the functionality and throughput offered by the module. Chassis revenue units represent the number of chassis on which revenue was recognized during the period.

Infrastructure chassis revenue units increased in 2010 compared to 2009, which was commensurate with Infrastructure product revenue growth during the year. Infrastructure port shipments increased in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to the continued growth in sales of MX Series products, which generally contain a higher number of ports per chassis. 37 Table of ContentsInfrastructure chassis revenue units decreased in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to reduced customer demand because of the weakened global economy. The port shipments increased in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to an increase in the MX Series products, which generally contain a higher number of ports per chassis. Infrastructure Service A majority of our service revenue is earned from customers that purchase our products and enter into support services contracts for support. Infrastructure service revenues increased in 2010 compared to 2009, which was primarily driven by increased revenue from new product sales and strong contract renewals for support services. From a geographical and market perspective, the increase in Infrastructure service revenues was primarily due to an increase in enterprise business across all regions and service provider bus iness in the EMEA and APAC regions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in service revenue in the Americas service provider market. Infrastructure service revenues increased in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to an increase in our installed base of equipment being serviced and support services renewals. From a geographical and market perspective, the increase in Infrastructure service revenues was primarily due to an increase in the enterprise and service provider business across all regions during the year ended December 31, 2009.

In the United States, net revenues increased in absolute dollars and increased as a percentage of total net revenues, in 2010 compared to 2009, due to the relative strength of the enterprise and service provider markets in the United States. Net revenues in the Americas region decreased in absolute dollars, but increased as a percentage of total net revenues in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to a revenue decrease from the service provider market, partially offset by an increase in net revenues from the enterprise market. In particular, the United States, Mexico, and Brazil accounted for more than half of the decline in net revenue in the Americas region. In the United States, net revenues decreased in absolute dollars and increased as a percentage of total net revenues, in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to the relative strength of sales in the United States compared to EMEA and APAC. Net revenues in EMEA increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to increased demand in the Russian Federation, Germany, and the United Kingdom. This increase was largely driven by product sales to both the enterprise and service provider markets. Net revenues in EMEA decreased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to reduced demand in the service provider market, partially offset by a slight increase in revenue from the enterprise market. In particular Sweden, Germany, Belgium, and United Kingdom attributed more than half of the decline in net revenues in EMEA. Net revenues in APAC increased in absolute dollars in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to increased demand in Japan, China, and Australia. This increase was primarily driven by product sales to enterprise customers and service sales to service provider customers. Net revenues in APAC decreased in absolute dollars in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to reduced demand in the service provider, partially offset by a slight increase in revenue from the enterprise market. In particular, over half of the decline in APAC net revenues was attributable to Japan. Net revenues in APAC as a percentage of total net revenues decreased slightly, primarily due to the relative strength of the enterprise market in the United States. 39 Table of Contents Net Revenues by Markets and Customers The following table presents the total net revenues by markets (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 $ Change % Change 2009 2008 $ Change % ChangeService Provider$2,631.5 $2,197.1 $434.4 20% $2,197.1 $2,568.2 $(371.1) (14)%Percentage of net revenues 64.3% 66.3%&nb sp; 66.3% 71.9% &nbs p; Enterprise1,461.8 1,118.8 343. 0 31% 1,118.8 1,004.2 114.6 &nbsp ;11 %Percentage of net revenues 35.7% 33.7%  33.7% 28.1% Total$4,093.3 $3,315.9 $777.4 23% $3,315.9 $3,572.4 $(256.5) (7)% We sell our high performance network products and service offerings from our Infrastructure and SLT segments to two primary markets service provider and enterprise. The service provider market includes wireline, wireless, and cable operators, as well as major internet content and application providers. The enterprise market represents businesses; federal, state, and local governments; and research and education institutions. Net revenues from sales to the service provider market increased in absolute dollars in 2010 compared 2009, primarily due to our customers increased investment in new network build outs and purchases of additional networking capacity to support network growth. Ne t revenues from the service provider market decreased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to our customers delayed investment in new network build outs and purchases of additional networking capacity in reaction to the weak global macroeconomic environment. The decline in service provider revenue as a percentage of net revenues was also attributable to the relative strength of our revenue from the enterprise market. Net revenues from sales to the enterprise market increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to our expanded portfolio of products and our continued investments to expand our footprint in the enterprise market. Net revenues fro m the enterprise market increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to revenue growth from our EX Series switching products. Verizon Communications, Inc., accounted for 10.6% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010. AT&T, Inc., accounted for 10.4% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Refer to Note 1, Basis of Presentation, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Most of our manufacturing, repair, and supply chain operations are outsourced to independent contract manufacturers. Accordingly, most of our cost of revenues consists of payments to our independent contract manufacturers for standard product costs. The cost of product revenues increased in absolute dollars in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to an increase in product volume. Product gross margin and product gross margin as a percentage of product revenues in 2010 compared to 2009 increased primarily due to a change in product mix that favored higher margin products and our continued efforts to manage costs. As of December 31, 2010, and 2009, we had 273 and 244 employees, respectively, in our manufacturing and operations organization that primarily manage relationships with our independent contract manufacturers, manage our supply chain, orchestrate new product introductions, and monitor and manage product testing and quality. The cost of product revenues and product gross margin decreased in absolute dollars in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to lower revenue level. The decrease in product gross margin as a percentage of revenues in 2009 compared to 2008, is primarily attributable to product mix that favored products with lower gross margin, such as our switching and MX Series products, geographical mix, and pricing. The cost of service revenues increased in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to increased headcount and outside services to support our customer needs and variable compensatio n. Support, professional, and educational services, also referred to as service related, headcount increased by 19% to 1,064 employees as of December 31, 2010, compared to 891 employees as of December 31, 2009. Total personnel related costs as a percentage of service revenues were relatively flat in 2010 as we continued to manage costs while growing our revenues. Information technology (IT) expenses related to cost of service revenues increased in 2010 compared to 2009, which is commensurate with the increase in headcount. Service gross margi n increased in absolute dollars primarily due to increased service revenues, and service gross margin as a percentage of service revenues decreased primarily due to a shift in mix that was driven by an increase in value added service related revenue. The cost of service revenues and service gross margin increased in 2009 compared to 2008. The increase in cost of service revenues was attributable to increased headcount and increased spending on service related spares. Service gross margin increased primarily due to our continued efforts to manage costs. Service related headcount increased by 108 employees, or 14%, to 891 employees in 2009, compared to 783 in 2008. Total personnel related costs as a percentage of serv ice revenues were approximately 18% for 2009 and 20% for 2008. The decrease in personnel related costs in 2009 as a percentage of service revenues was primarily due to the overall increase in service revenues. Our outside service expense also increased in 2009, 41 Table of Contentsprimarily to support the expanding installed equipment base. Additiona lly, facilities and IT expenses related to cost of service revenues increased in connection with the growth of service business as a portion of our overall operations. The decrease in cost of service revenues and operating expenses including R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses, due to foreign currency fluctuations was approximately 1%, 2%, and 1% in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Facility and IT departmental costs are allocated to cost of revenues and operating expense based on usage and headcount, respectively. Such costs increased by $20.1 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due to an increase in departmental headcount, the continued build out of our domestic and international development and test centers, and IT applications to support our internal operations. Facility and IT related headcount was 388, 294, and 267 as of December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. In 2011, we expect to continue to invest in our company wide IT infrastructure as we implement our operational excellence initiatives.

Personnel related costs, including wages, commissions, bonuses, vacation, benefits, share based compensation, and travel, have historically been the primary driver of our operating expenses, and we expect this trend to continue. We had 8,772, 7,231, and 7,014 employees as of December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. The 2010 year over year increase was due to growth across all of our organizations as a result of our efforts to grow the business. 42 Table of Contents R&D expenses increa sed in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to additional headcount and strategic initiatives to expand our product portfolio. In particular, we focused on delivering optical capabilities and a packet optimized transport system that will help service providers better support packet and IP based services, such as video, mobility and cloud computing. Personnel related costs increased $111.6 million in 2010, primarily due to a 25% increase in headcount in our engineering organization, from 3,308 to 4,132 employees, to support product innovation intended to captur e anticipated future network infrastructure growth and opportunities. Additionally, our outside consulting, facilities, and IT costs related to R&D expenses increased to support our R&D efforts. R&D expenses increased in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to additional headcount and strategic initiatives to expand our product portfolio and maintain our technological advantage over competitors. In particular, in 2009, we continued to expand our EX Series switching product portfolio and increased our investments in Project Stratus, which was our initiative to deliver the next generation data center fabric, and Project Falcon, which was our effort to develop mobility solutions for service provider customers. Personnel related costs increased $25.6 million in 2009, primarily due to a 4% increase in headcount in our engineering organization, from 3,194 to 3,308 employees, to support product innovation intended to capture anticipated future network infrastructure growth and opportunities. Outside consulting and other development expense also increased to support our product innovation initiatives. Additionally, facilities and IT expenses related to R&D expenses increased to support these engineering efforts. Sales and marketing expenses increased in 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, primarily due to our 2010 advertising campaign, events for new product launches, and an increase in personnel related costs of $95.8 million. The increase in personnel related costs was primarily due to a 17% increase in our sales and marketing headcount from 2,101 to 2,466 employees, an increase in variable compensation driven by growth in our revenues, and an increase in outside services to support our sales and marketing programs. As a percentage of net revenues, sales and marketing expenses decreased slightly in 2010 due to our focus on managing expenses and creating efficiency in our sales activities. Sales and marketing expenses decreased in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to a decrease in personnel related expenses and travel expenses. As a percentage of net revenues, sales and marketing expenses increased slightly in 2009 due to the increased spending related to the corporate re branding and channel marketing campaigns, partially offset by our focus on managing expenses and creating efficiency in our sales activities. Personnel related costs decreased $15.8 million in 2009, primarily due to a 4% decrease in headcount from 2,190 employees at the end of 2008 to 2,101 employees at the end of 2009. In addition, commission expense decreased by $12.0 million due to lower net revenues in 2009 compared to 2008. As our sales force decreased, we also decreased facilities and IT expenses related to the sales and marketing organizations in 2009 compared to 2008. G&A expenses increased in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to an increase in personnel related expenses. As a percentage of net revenues, G&A expenses decreased slightly in 2010 due to our continued focus on managing expenses. Personnel related costs increased $25.0 million in 2010, primarily due to a 14% increase in headcount, from 393 to 449 employees in our worldwide G&A funct ions to support expected future growth of the business, as well as higher variable compensation driven by growth in revenues. Additionally, facilities and IT expenses related to our G&A infrastructure increased to support our growing business. G&A expenses increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to an increase in personnel related expenses and outside professional services. Personnel related costs increased $7.2 million in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to a 12% increase in headcount, from 350 to 393 employees, in our worldwide G&A functions to support expected future growth of the business. Outside professional service fees increased in 2009 compared to 2008 as a result of incre ased legal fees. Additionally, facilities and IT expenses related to our G&A infrastructure increased to support our growing business. Amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased in 2010 compared to 2009, and in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to certain purchased intangible assets reaching the end of their amortization period during 2009. We had no impairment of our goodwill or our purchased intangible assets in 2010 and 2009. In 2008, we had no impairment of our goodwill and recognized an impairment charge of $5.0 million for our purchased intangible assets, as a result of the phase out of our DX products. In 2009, we recorded litigation settlement charges of $182.3 million, which included $169.0 million related to our agreement in principle reached in February 2010, to settle the securities class action litigation pending against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors, $13.0 million related to the resolution of a dispute in connection with certain real estate in Sunnyvale California purchased in 2000 and $0.3 million related to another settlement recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009. 43 Table of ContentsOf these amounts, $181.3 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009. In 2008, we recorded a litigation settlement loss of $9.0 million related to our shareholder derivative lawsuit. See Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for more information. No such charges were incurred in 2010. In 2010 and 2009, we recorded $10.8 million and $19.5 million, respectively, as a result of a restructuring plan to reduce our real estate portfolio and workforce in targeted areas of the Company. There were no restructuring charges in 2008. As of December 31, 2010, the 2009 Restructuring Plan was complete. See Note 8, Other Financial Information, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for more information regarding our restructuring liabilities. In 2010, we recor ded $6.3 million in direct and indirect acquisition related costs such as financial advisory, legal, due diligence, and integration costs from the acquisitions of Ankeena, SMobile, Altor, and Trapeze. See Note 3, Business Combinations, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for further discussion of these acquisitions. There were no acquisitions or acquisition related charges recorded in 2009 and 2008. Share Based Compensation The Companys share based compensation expense associated with stock options, ESPP, RSUs, and PSAs is recorded in the following categories for each of the three years ended December 31, 2010 (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 $ Change % Change 2009 2008 $ Change % ChangeCost of revenues Product$4.4 $3.9 $0.5 13% $3.9 $3.0 $0.9 32%Cost of revenues Service (1)13.5 10.5 3.0 29%&nb sp;10.5 9.2 1.3 14%Research and development78.5 59.3 19.2 32% 59.3 47.0 12.3 26%Sales and marketing (1)54.9 43.1 11.8 27% 43.1 36.2 6.9 19%General and administrative30.7 22.9 7.8  34% 22.9 12.7  10.2 80%Total182.0 139.7 42.3 30% 139.7 108.1 31.6 29% (1) Prior period information has been reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation. Refer to Note 1, Basis of Presentation, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The 2010 share based compensation expense includes the value of vested restricted shares paid to certain former Ankeena employees. Refer to Note 5, Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments, under the heading "Restricted Cash" in Notes to Consolidated in Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Share based compensation expense increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to an increase in RSU and PSA grants during the period primarily resulting from an increase in the number of participants. The increase in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily relates to new stock option grants, particularly in late 2008. Interest and Other Income, net, Gain (Loss) on Equity Investments, and Income Tax Provision The following table presents interest and other income, net, gain (loss) on equity investments, and income tax provision (in millions, except percentages):  Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 $ Change % Change 2009 2008 $ Change % ChangeInterest and other income, net$1.9 $6.9 $(5.0) (72)% $6.9 $48.7 $(41.8) (86)%Percentage of net revenues N/M 0.2 %  0.2 % 1.4 %  Gain (loss) on equity investments8.7 (5.5) 14.2 256 % (5.5) (14.8)&nbsp ;9.3 (63)%Percentage of net revenues 0.2% (0.2)% (0.2)% (0.4)%  Income tax provision158.8 196.8 (38.0) (19)% 196.8 217.2 (20.4) (9)% Net interest and other income decreased in 2010 compared to 2009, and in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to lower 44 Table of Contentsinterest rates and an increase in customer financing charges during 2010. In 2010, we recognized a total gain of $8.7 million, primarily due to acquisitions of our privately held equity investments in Ankeena and Altor. There were no impairment charges related to our equity investments in the year ended December 31, 2010. During 2009 and 2008, we recognized impairment losses of $5.5 million and $14.8 million, respectively, on our equity investments for changes in fair value that we believed were other than temporary. Our effective tax rates were 20.4%, 63.1%, and 29.8% in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. The decrease in overall rate in 2010 compared to 2009, and the federal statutory rate of 35%, was primarily due to a $54.1 million income tax benefit recorded during the Companys first quarter resulting from a change in the Companys estimate of unrecognized tax benefits due to the taxpayer favorable ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the Court) in Xilinx Inc. v. Commissioner related to share based compensation, the federal R&D credit, and the benefit of earnings in foreign jurisdictions, which are subject to lower tax rates. The increase in the overall rate in 2009 compared to 2008, and the federal statutory rate of 35%, was primarily due to the following income tax charges: (i) a $61.8 million discrete and other related charge that resulted from changes in California income tax laws that were enacted during 2009; (ii) a $52.1 million charge that resulted from a change in our unrecognized tax benefits related to share based compensation ; and (iii) a $4.6 million charge which related to an investigation by the India tax authorities. The effective rate impact from these charges was partially offset by the federal R&D credit and the benefit of earnings in foreign jurisdictions, which are subject to lower tax rates. The 2008 effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 35% primary due to the federal R&D credit and the benefit of earnings in foreign jurisdictions, which are subject to lower tax rates. For a complete reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and further explanation of our income tax provision, see Note 14, Income Taxes, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement s in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 45 Table of ContentsSegment Information For a description of the products and services for each segment, see Item 1 Business, in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10 K.

Infrastructure Segment An analysis of the change in revenues for the Infrastructure segment, and the change in reve nue units, can be found above in the section titled Infrastructure Segment Revenues. Infrastructure operating income increased as a percent of Infrastructure revenue in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to a higher gross margin percentage, which was attributable to changes in product mix that favored higher margin products. Additionally, although Infrastructure sales and marketing expenses increased in absolute dollars as we increased our efforts to reach enterprise and service provider customers, they decreased as a percentage of Infrastructure revenues.Infrastructure segment operating incom e as a percent of revenue decreased in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to a lower gross margin percentage that was driven by changes in product mix and to a lesser extent pricing. Additionally R&D expenses increased as a percentage of Infrastructure revenue in 2009 as we continued to make investments to expand our product features and functionality and Sales and Marketing expenses increased slightly as a percentage of Infrastructure revenue, as we increased our efforts to reach enterprise and service provider customers.SLT Segment An an alysis of the change in revenues for the SLT segment, and the change in units, can be found above in the section titled SLT Segment Revenues. SLT operating income increased as a percent of revenue in 2010 compared to 2009 due primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses as a percent of SLT revenue as we continued our efforts to carefully manage costs. Additionally, the increase was attributable to higher gross margin percentage resulting from changes in product mix and efficiencies achieved from the higher 46 Table of Contents2010 revenues. SLT operating income increased as a percentage of revenue in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to lower R&D and other operating expenses as a percent of SLT revenue from reductions in discretionary spending as a part of our cost control initiatives and higher gross margin percentage from changes in product mix. Key Performance Measures In addition to the financial metrics included in the consolidated financial statements, we use the following key performance measures to assess operating results:  Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008Days sales outstanding (DSO)(1)45 44 42 Book to bill ratio(2)&gt;1& nbsp; &gt;1 &gt;1 (1) DSO is calculated as the ratio of ending accounts receivable, net of allowances, divided by average daily net sales for the preceding 90 days.(2) Book to bill ratio represents the ratio of product orders booked divided by product revenues during the respective period. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following sections discuss the effects of changes in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flows, contractual obligations, and our stock repurchase program on our liquidity and capital resources. Overview Historically, we have funded our business primarily through our operating activities and, to a lesser extent, the issuance of our common stock. The following table shows our capital resources (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 $ Change % ChangeWorking capital$1,742.4 $1,503.2 $239.2 16 %Cash and cash equivalents$1,811.9 $1,604.7 $207.2 13 %Short term investments474.5 570.5 (96.0) (17)%Long term investments535.2 483.5 51.7 11 %Total cash, cash equivalents, and investments$2,821.6 $2,658.7 $162.9 6 % The significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and short term investments, reduced by deferred revenue, accrued liabilities and accounts payable. The increase in working capital from December 31, 2009, to December 31, 2010, is pr imarily due to higher cash and cash equivalents, higher accounts receivable due to the timing of shipments at the end of the period, higher prepaid income taxes, partially offset by a decrease in accrued litigation settlements. Stock Repurchase Activities In February 2010, the Board of Directors (the Board) approved a new stock repurchase program (the 2010 Stock Repurchase Program) un der which we are authorized to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock. This new authorization is in addition to the stock repurchase program approved by the Board in March 2008 (the 2008 Stock Repurchase Program), under which we were also authorized to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock. Under the two stock repurchase programs, we repurchased approximately 19.7 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $28.67 per share for a total purchase price of $563.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2010, and approximately 20.7 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $21.91 per share for a total purchase price of $453.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2010, there were no remaining authorized funds under the 2008 Stock Repurchase Program and $755.1 million remaining authorized funds under the 2010 Stock Repurchase Program. 47 Table of ContentsIn addition to repurchases under our stock repurchase programs, we also had broker transacted repurchases of common stock from our employees in connection with net issuance of shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations for the vesting of certain RSUs and PSAs. The repurchases were for approximately 0.1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $25.75 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $1.9 million in connection with the net issuances during the year ended December 31, 2010. There was an immaterial amount of broker transacted repurchases of common stock from our employees in connection with net issuance of shares during year ended December 31, 2009. All shares of common stock repurchased under the 2008 and 2010 stock repurchase programs and from our employees in connection with net issuances have been retired. Future share repurchases under the 2010 Stock Repurchase Program will be subject to a review of the circumstances in place at that time and will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. This program may be discontinued at any time. See Note 18, Subsequent Events, for discussion of our stock repurchase activity in 2011. Summary of Cash Flows In the year ended December 31, 2010, cash and cash equivalents increased by $207.2 millio n. This increase was the result of cash generated from our operating activities of $812.3 million, partially offset by cash used in our investing and financing activities of $532.8 million and $72.4 million, respectively. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $812.3 million, $796.1 million, and $875.2 million for 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. The increase of $16.2 million from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to higher net income, partially offset by litigatio n settlement payments, prepaid taxes, and higher accounts receivable. Operating cash flow decreased by $79.1 million from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009, primarily due to lower net income, partially offset by increase in other accrued liabilities due to the litigation settlement reached in the fourth quarter of 2009. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $532.8 million, $948.3 million, and $149.8 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. The change between periods was primarily due to the movement of cash between cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments due to our investment strategy. The change from 2009 to 2010 was further impacted by net cash paid for acquisitions in 2010. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $72.4 million, $262.2 million, and $422.4 million for 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. The change between periods was due to an increase in cash used to repurchase our common stock through our stock repurchase programs, whi ch was partially offset by greater cash proceeds from issuance of common stock to employees for each period as the result of the higher stock prices. 48 Table of ContentsDeferred Revenue The following table summarizes our deferred product and service revenues (in millions): As of December 31, 2010 2009Deferred product revenue: Undelivered product commitments and other product deferrals$294.1 $254.7 Distributor inventory and other sell through items143.4 136.6 Deferred gross product revenue437.5 391.3 Deferred cost of product revenue(148.8) (150.0) Deferred product revenue, net288.7 241.3 Deferred service revenue595.7  512.3 Total$884.4 $753.6 Reported as: Current$ 660.2 $571.7 Long term224.2 181.9 Total$884.4 $753.6 Deferred gross product revenue as of December 31, 2010, increased $46.2 million compared to December 31, 2009, primarily due to an increase in undelivered product commitments and other product deferrals. Total deferred service revenue increased $83.4 million compared to December 31, 2009, largely due to higher sales of service contracts and multi year service billings. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We had no off balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2010, and 2009. Contractual Obligations Our principal commitments consist of obligations outstanding under operating leases, purchase commitments, tax liabilities, and other contractual obligations. The following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in millions): Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Other Operating leases (1)$296.3 $51.1 $110.3 $65.2 $69.7 $&mdash; Purchase commitments (2)198.6 198.6 &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; Tax liabilities (3)103.9 &mdash; &mdash;  &mdash; &mdash; 103.9 Other contractual obligations (4)95.1 65.8 29.3 &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; Total$693.9 $315.5 $139.6 $65.2 $69.7 $103.9 (1) Our contractual obligations under operating leases primarily relate to our leased facilities under our non cancelable operating leases. Rent payments are allocated to costs and operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. We occupy approximately 2.2 million square feet worldwide under operating leases. The majority of our office space is in North America, including our corporate headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. Our longest lease expires on November 22, 2022.(2) In order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply, our contract manufacturers place non cancelable, non returnable (NCNR) orders for components based on our build forecasts. The contract manufacturers use the components to build products based on our forecasts and on purchase orders we have received from our customers. Generally, we do not own the components and title to the product transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon delivery at a designated shipment location. If the components go unused or the products go unsold for specified periods of time, we may incur carrying charges or obsolete materials charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders. As of December 31, 2010, we had accrued $22.7 million based on our estimate of such charges. Total purchase commitments as of December 31, 2010, consisted of $198.6 million of NCNR orders.(3) Tax liabilities include $103.9 million of long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet for unrecognized tax positions. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments related to this amount due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.(4) Other contractual obligations consists of $65.0 million of indemnity related and service related escrows required by certain acquisitions completed in 2005 and 2010, $13.2 million remaining balance for a data center hosting agreement that requires payments through the end of April 2013, $9.2 million for license and service agreements, and $7.7 million under a software subscription agreement that requires payments through the end of January 2011. 49 Table of ContentsGuarantees We have entered into agreements with some of our customers that contain indemnification provisions relating to potential situations where claims could be alleged that our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of a third party. Other guarantees or indemnification arrangements include guarantees of product and service performance, standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities, and guarantees related to third party customer financing arrangements. As of December 31, 2010, we had $21.6 million in guarantees and standby letters of credit. As of December& nbsp;31, 2009, we had $34.0 million in guarantees and standby letters of credit. Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements Liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our operating activities as well as acq uisitions and investments in strategic relationships we may make in the future. Additionally, if we were to repurchase additional shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, our liquidity may be impacted. As of December 31, 2010, over 60% of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were held outside of the U.S., which may be subject to U.S. taxes if repatriated. In August 2010, we filed a $1.5 billion shelf registration with the SEC. The filing replaced our prior $1.0 billion shelf registration which had expired. The shelf registration is intended to give us flexibility to take advantage of financing opportunities as needed or deemed desirable in light of market conditions. Any offerings of securities will be made pursuant to a prospectus. We have been focused on managing our annual equity usage as a percentage of the common stock outstanding to align with peer group competitive levels and have made changes in recent years to reduce the number of shares underlying the equity awards we grant. Our intention for fiscal year 2010 was and fiscal year 2011 is to target the number of shares underlying equity awards granted on an annual basis at approximately three percent (3%) of our common stock outstanding. Based upon shares underlying our grants to date of options, RSUs, and PSAs (counting only the on target measure of such PSAs), we achieved that goal with res pect to 2010, and we believe we are on track with respect to this goal for 2011. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short term and long term investments, together with cash generated from operations and cash generated from the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan will be sufficient to fund our operations and anticipated growth for at least the next 12 months. We believe our working capital is sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for capital expenditures, commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations during the same period. However, our future liquidity and capital requirements may v ary materially from those now planned depending on many factors, including: &bull; the overall levels of sales of our products, the mix of product sales, and gross profit margins; &bull; our business, product, capital expenditures, and R&D plans; &bull; repurchases of our common stock; &bull; incurrence and repayment of debt; &bull; litigation expenses, settlements, and judgments, or similar items related to resolution of tax audits; &bull; volume price discounts and customer rebates; &bull; the levels of accounts receivable that we maintain; &bull; acquisitions of other businesses, assets, products, or technologies; &bull; changes in our compensation policies; &bull; capital improvements for new and existing facilities; &bull; our competitors responses to our products; &bull; our relationships with suppliers, partners, and customers; &bull; possible future investments in raw material and finished goods inventories; 50 Table of Contents&bull; expenses related to our future restructuring plans, if any; &bull; tax expense associated with stock based awards; &bull; issuance of stock based awards and the related payment in cash for withholding taxes in the current year and possibly during future years; &bull; the level of exercises of stock options and stock purchases under our equity incentive plans; and &bull; general economic conditions and specific conditions in our industry a nd markets, including the effects of disruptions in global credit and financial markets, international conflicts, and related uncertainties. 51 Table of ContentsITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. The value of our investments is subject to market price volatility. In addition, as of December 31, 2010, over 60% of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are held in non U.S. domiciled countries. Our marketable securities are generally classified as available for sale and, consequently, are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio. Conversely, a decline in interest rates could have a material impact on interest income from our investment portfolio. We do not curr ently hedge these interest rate exposures. We recognized immaterial gains and losses during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, related to the sales of our investments. The following tables present hypothetical changes in fair value of the financial instruments held at December 31, 2010, and 2009, that are sensitive to changes in interest rates (in millions): Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Rate Decrease of X BPS Fair Value as of December 31, 2010 Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Rate Increase of X BPS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS)  50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS Government treasury and agenc ies$457.4 $456.3 $455.1 $454.1 $452.8 $451.7 $450.5 Corporate bonds and notes469.9 467.2 464.4 461.7 459.0 456.2 453.5 Foreign government debt securities47.8 47.5 47.3 47.0 46.8 46.5 46.3 Other1,291.6 1,291.2 1,290.7  1,290.1 1,289.7 1,289.2 1,288.7 Total$2,266.7 $2,262.2 $2,257.5 $2,252.9 $2,248.3 $ 2,243.6 $2,239.0  Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Rate Decrease of X BPS Fair Value as of December 31, 2009 Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Rate Increase of X BPS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS Government treasury and agencies$461.3 $460.0 $458.7 $457.3 $456.1 $454.8 $453.4 Corporate bonds and notes495.4 493.5 491.6 489.8 487.9 486.0 484.2 Foreign government debt securities98.2 97.7 97.2 96.7 96.2 95.7 95.2 Other1,099.7 1,099.7 1,099.7 1,099.7 1,099.6 1,099.6 1,099.6 Total$2,154.6 $2,150.9 $2,147.2 $2,143.5 $2,139.8 $2,136.1 $2,132.4 These instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading. The modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (BPS), 100 BPS, and 150 BPS, which are representative of the historical movements in the Federal Funds Rate. Foreign Currency Risk and Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts Periodically, we use derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and l osses generated from the re measurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies. These derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other income (expense) in the same period as the changes in the fair value from the re measurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. These foreign exchange contracts have maturities of approximately two months. Our sales and costs of product revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. Dollars. Our cost of service revenue and operating 52 Table of Contentsexpenses are denominated in U.S. Dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the British Pound, the Euro, Indian Rupee, and Japanese Yen. Periodically, we use foreign currency forward and or option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to cost of service revenue and operating expenses. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have matu rities of less than one year. The effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and, upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction, is subsequently reclassified into the line item in the consolidated statements of operations to which the hedged transaction relates. We record the ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments, which was immaterial during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively, in other income (expense) on our consolidated statements of ope rations. The change in operating expenses including cost of service revenue, R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses, due to foreign currency fluctuations was approximately 1%, 2%, and 1% in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Equity Price Risk Our portfolio of publicly traded equity securities and our non qualified deferred compensation (NQDC) plan, which may also hold publicly traded equity securities, are inherently exposed to equity price risk as the stock market fluctuates. Our publicly traded equity securities are classified as available for sale securities on our consolidated balance sheets. Investments under the NQDC plan are considered trading securities and are also reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet. We do not purchase our publicly traded equity securities with the intent to use them for speculative purposes. As of December 31, 2010, we no longer have any investments in publicly traded equity securities. The aggregate fair value of our publicl y traded equity securities as of December 31, 2009, was $5.4 million. As of December 31, 2010, and 2009, the total investments under the NQDC plan were $8.1 million and $4.7 million, respectively. A hypothetical 30% adverse change on the total investments under the NQDC plan as of December 31, 2010, and 2009 would result in an immaterial loss. We monitor our portfolio publicly traded equity investments for impairment on a periodic basis. In the event that the carrying value of a public traded equity investment exceeds its fair value, and we determine the decline in value to be other than temporary, we reduce the carrying value to its current fair value. There were no impairment charges in 2010 and 2009 to our portfolio of publicly traded equity investments, and in 2008, we realized an impairment charge of $3.5 million. In addition to publicly traded equity securities, we have also invested in privately held companies. These investments are carried at cost. In 2009 we realized an impairment charge of $5.5 million on our investments in privately held companies that we judged to be other than temporary as discussed in Note 6, Fair Value Measurements, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. There were no such charges in 2010. The aggregate cost of our investments in privately held companies was $22.1 million and $13.9 million as of December 31, 2010, and 2009, respectively. 53 Table of Contents
