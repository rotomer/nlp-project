ITEM 7.Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This Annual Report on Form 10 K (Report), including the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward looking statements regarding future events and the future results of Juniper Networks, Inc. ("we," "us," or the Company) that are based on our current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about our business, our results of operations, the industry in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management. Words such as expects, anticipates, targets, goals, projects, would, could, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. These forward looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this Report under the section entitled Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I and elsewhere, and in other reports we file with the SEC, specifically our most recent reports on Form 10 Q. While forward looking statements are based on reasonable expectations of our management at the time that they are made, you should not rely on them. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason. The following discussion is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). In the course of operating our business, we routinely make decisions as to the timing of the payment of invoices, the collection of receivables, the manufacturing and shipment of products, the fulfillment of orders, the purchase of supplies, and the building of inventory and spare parts, among other matters. Each of these decisions has some impact on the financial results for any given period. In making these decisions, we consider various factors including contractual obligations, customer satisfaction, competition, internal and external financial targets and expectations, and financial planning objectives. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosure of contingencies. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to sales returns, pricing credits, warranty costs, allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long term assets, especially goodwill and intangible assets, contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges, assumptions used in the valuation of share based compensation, and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. For further information about our critical accounting policies and estimates, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, and our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section included in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. To aid in understanding our operating results for the periods covered by this Report, we have provided an executive overview and a summary of the business and market environment. These sections should be read in conjunction with the more detailed discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in this Item 7, our Risk Factors section included in Item 1A of Part I, and our audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in Item 8 of Part II of this report. 30Table of ContentsBusiness and Market EnvironmentAt Juniper Networks, we focus on architecting the new network. We design, develop, and sell products and services that together provide our customers with a high performance network infrastructure built on simplicity, security, openness, and scale. We serve the high performance networking requirements of global service providers, enterprises, governments, and research and public sector organizations that view the network as critical to their success. Our broad product portfolio spans routing, switching, security, application acceleration, identity policy and control, and network management to provide customers high performance, greater choice and flexibility while reducing overall total cost of ownership. We do business in three geographic regions: Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and Asia Pacific (APAC), and our operations are organized into two reportable segments: Infrastructure and Service Layer Technologies (SLT). Our Infrastructure segment primarily offers scalable routing and switching products that are used to control and direct network traffic from the core, through the edge, aggregation, and the customer premise equipment level, as well as a complete wireless local area network ("WLAN") solution that provides high reliability, performance, security, and management for mobile applications. Our SLT segment offers solutions that meet a broad array of our customers priorities, from protecting the network itself and data on the network, to maximizing existing bandwidth and acceleration of applications across a distributed network. Both segments offer worldwide services, including technical support under maintenance contracts and professional services, as well as educational and training programs to our customers.Over the past two years we have aligned our organization around a common vision for the new network. Together, our high performance product and service offerings help our customers to convert legacy networks that provide commoditized services into more valuable assets that provide differentiation, value, and increased performance, reliability, and security to end users. We remain dedicated to uncovering new ideas and innovations that will serve the exponential demands of the networked world and we will continue to build solutions that center on simplification, automation, and open innovation. During 2011, we continued to experience a challenging macroeconomic environment. The effect of the increased macro volatility escalated especially over the second half of the year due to sovereign debt concerns in Europe as well as slow down of the economies in APAC and in the Americas. A number of our largest U.S. customers, including Tier 1 service providers and financial service firms, reduced their spend toward the end of the year. Additionally, our customers held off their core routing purchases in anticipation of the T4000 Series launch as we entered into a new product cycle. Despite the impact from the near term challenges, our revenue grew in 2011. The investments we have made in R&D are delivering on a wave of new products, from our new offerings in the data center, QFabric, to enterprise mobility and to our Converged Supercore routing technology. The three core components of QFabric the Node, Interconnect and Director were released; the next wave of MobileNext features including the S Gateway for mobile operators were announced during the year; our Converged Supercore solution, PTX Series switches, are expected to begin shipment in the first quarter of 2012; and the T4000 Core Router commenced shipment in the fourth quarter of 2011. In addition, we have put the right organization structure in place to effectively drive our innovative portfolio and support our customers next generation network requirements. In the coming year, we will remain focused on balancing the longer term needs of the business while remaining agile and prudent with our spending in the short term. We believe the underlying fundamentals of our business remain healthy and we are focused on executing our strategy to address the market trends of mobile Internet and cloud computing. We believe our strategy aligns well with the driving forces of the Network. We believe innovation will drive long term value creation in the networking industry, as customers forgo the complexity and unnecessary costs of old architectures and embrace open systems that can scale across the multiple dimensions of network growth. With our strategy, our innovation pipeline, and the deeper penetration in both service provider and enterprise markets, we plan to navigate the challenging near term environment in 2012 based on the following five operating principles:Assume continued uncertainty in the near term macro environment;Grow faster than the markets we serve by focusing on new product introductions to accelerate growth as we exit 2012; Maintain investments that deliver innovation and our product roadmap;Focus on prudent cost management; andGenerate good cash flows to support our strategic needs and maintain a strong balance sheet.31Table of ContentsFinancial Results and Key Performance Metrics Overview The following table provides an overview of our key financial metrics for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 (in millions, except per share amounts and percentages):32Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 $ Change %Change 2010 2009 $ Change %ChangeNet revenues$4,448.7 $4,093.3 $355.4 9% $4,093.3 $3,315.9 $777.4 23% Gross margin$2,868.6 $2,741.7 $126.8 5% $2,741.7 $2,183.2 $558.5 26%Percentage of net revenues64.5% 67.0% 67.0% 65.8% Operating income$618.5 $767.6 $(149.1) (19)% $767.6 $310.7 $456.9 147%Percentage of net revenues13.9% 18.8% 18.8% 9.4% Net income attributable to Juniper Networks$425.1 $618.4 $(193.3) (31)% $618.4 $117.0 $501.4 429%Percentage of net revenues9.6% 15.1% 15.1% 3.5% Net income per share attributable to Juniper Networks common stockholders: Basic$0.80 $1.18 $(0.38) (32)% $1.18 $0.22 $0.96 436%Diluted$0.79 $1.15 $(0.36) (31)% $1.15 $0.22 $0.93 423% Operating cash flows$986.7 $812.3 $174.4 21% $812.3 $796.1 $16.2 2%Deferred revenue$967.0 $884.4 $82.6 9% $884.4 $753.6 $130.8 17%Days sales outstanding ("DSO")46 45 1 2% 45 44 1 2%Book to bill1 &gt;1 &gt;1 &gt;1 Net Revenues: Our net revenue increased across all three geographic regions and in both service provider and enterprise markets for year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the prior year. These increases were primarily driven by increases in revenue from routing and switching products as well as higher service revenue across both the Infrastructure and SLT segments, partially offset by a slight decrease in our SLT product revenue.Gross Margin: Gross margin as a percentage of net revenues decreased for year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower product and service gross margin percentages and a higher proportion of service revenue for which gross margin is generally lower than product margin. Product gross margin as a percentage of product revenue declined due to a shift in geographic mix, increased overhead and increased inventory related costs. Service gross margin as a percentage of service revenue declined mainly due to the investment in resources to support our expanded product portfolio.Operating Income: Our operating income decreased as a percentage of revenues in the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to 2010, primarily due to slower revenue growth relative to the increase of investments in Sales and Marketing and Research and Development ("R&D") expenses as we continue to invest in our innovative portfolio and increase sales coverage for our new products. In addition, we recorded restructuring and other charges of $30.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily related to workforce reduction activities and asset impairments.Net Income Attributable to Juniper Networks and Net Income Per Share Attributable to Juniper Networks Common Stockholders: The decrease in net income attributable to Juniper Networks in the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to 2010, reflects the lower operating income discussed above as well as higher interest expense of $49.5 million primarily attributable to interest on our long term debt issued in March 2011.Operating Cash Flows: Operating cash flows in December 31, 2011 increased compared to 2010. Operating cash flows in the prior year included a $169.3 million litigation settlement payment.Deferred Revenue: Total deferred revenue increased $82.6 million to $967.0 million as of December 31, 2011, compared to $884.4 million as of December 31, 2010, due to an increase in deferred service revenue driven by product sales and renewals, slightly offset by a small decrease in deferred product revenue. Total deferred service revenue increased $86.1 million compared to December 31, 2010, primarily due to an increase in new service contracts and renewal of existing contracts. Deferred gross product revenue as of December 31, 2011, decreased $15.4 million compared to December 31, 2010, primarily due to the release of approximately $62.7 million from various product commitments made as of December 31, 2010 and delivered during 2011, partially offset by new product commitments and other deferrals. 33Table of ContentsDSO: DSO as of December 31, 2011 was relatively flat compared to the prior year. DSO is calculated as the ratio of ending accounts receivable, net of allowances, divided by average daily net sales for the preceding 90 days.Book to Bill: Book to bill was one for the quarter ended December 31, 2011, and greater than one for the quarter ended December 31, 2010. Book to bill represents the ratio of product orders booked divided by product revenues during the respective period. Product orders exclude certain future revenue adjustments for items such as product revenue deferrals, sales return reserves, and service revenue allocations, and early payment discounts.Stock Repurchase Plan Activity: Under our stock repurchase program, we repurchased approximately 17.5 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $30.93 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $541.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2011.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, to determine the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The critical accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies. To the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future consolidated results of operations may be affected. Revenue recognition. Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred, (3) sales price is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. We enter into contracts to sell our products and services, and while some of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, there are agreements that contain multiple elements or non standard terms and conditions. As a result, significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and, if so, how the price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element. Changes in the allocation of the sales price between elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition but will not change the total revenue recognized on the contract. Under our revenue recognition policies, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) if available, or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor Third Party Evidence ("TPE") is available. We establish VSOE of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately. ESP is established considering internal factors such as margin objectives, pricing practices and controls, customer segment pricing strategies and product life cycle. Consideration is also given to market conditions such as industry pricing strategies and technology life cycles. When determining ESP, we apply management judgment to establish margin objectives and pricing strategies and to evaluate market conditions and product life cycles. We do not use TPE as we do not consider our products to be similar or interchangeable to our competitors products in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. Revenue from maintenance service contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual support period, which is generally one to three years. We apply ESP to the majority of our product revenue and VSOE to our service revenue in 2011 and 2010. Contract Manufacturer Liabilities. We outsource most of our manufacturing, repair, and supply chain management operations to our independent contract manufacturers, and a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of payments to them. Our independent contract manufacturers produce our products using design specifications, quality assurance programs, and standards that we establish, and they procure components and manufacture our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts are our estimates of future demand for our products, based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and marketing organizations, adjusted for overall market conditions. We establish a provision for inventory, carrying costs, and obsolete material exposures for excess components purchased based on historical trends. Significant judgment is used in establishing our forecasts of future demand, inventory carrying costs, and obsolete material exposures. If the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast, which may be caused by factors outside of our control, we may incur charges for excess 34Table of Contentscomponents, which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability. Supply chain management remains an area of focus as we balance the risk of material obsolescence and supply chain flexibility in order to reduce lead times. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, our contract manufacturer liabilities were $14.8 million and $22.7 million, respectively.Warranty Reserves. We generally offer a one year warranty on all of our hardware products and a 90 day warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the products. We use judgment and estimates when determining warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs, labor costs for trouble shooting and repair, and overhead at the time revenue is recognized. Material cost is estimated primarily based upon the historical costs to repair or replace product returns within the warranty period. Technical support labor and overhead cost are estimated primarily based upon historical trends in the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period. Although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, if actual product failure rates, use of materials, or service delivery costs differ from estimates, additional warranty costs may be incurred, which could reduce gross margin. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, our warranty reserves were $28.3 million and $35.9 million, respectively.Goodwill and Other Long Lived Assets. We make significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis. These estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from the management of the acquired company. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, historical and projected customer retention rates, anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customer and product base, and the expected use of the acquired assets. These factors are also considered in determining the useful life of the acquired intangible assets. The amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense. The value of our goodwill and intangible assets could be impacted by future adverse changes such as, but not limited to: (a) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; (b) a substantial decline in our market capitalization, (c) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; (d) unanticipated competition; (e) loss of key personnel; (f) a more likely than not expectation of sale or disposal of a reporting unit or a significant portion thereof; (g) a realignment of our resources or restructuring of our existing businesses in response to changes to industry and market conditions; (h) testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; or (i) higher discount rate used in the impairment analysis as impacted by an increase in interest rates. We evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of November 1st or more frequently if we believe impairment indicators exist. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segment level, by comparing the reporting units carrying value, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair values of the reporting units are estimated using significant judgment based on a combination of the income and the market approaches. Under the income approach, we estimate fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of forecasted future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value of our reporting units based on an analysis that compares the value of the reporting units to values of publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. If the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit, then we perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill. When the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, we record an impairment loss equal to the difference. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit or a indefinite lived purchased intangible asset is highly judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, operating trends, risk adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocated shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. As of December 31, 2011, Goodwill recorded for our SLT segment and Infrastructure segment was $2,282.6 million and $1,645.5 million, respectively. A hypothetical decrease of 5% in the estimated fair value of our reporting units would result in excess fair value over carrying value of approximately nil for our SLT segment to $7.3 billion for our Infrastructure segment. We evaluate long lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the fair value of the 35Table of Contentsunderlying asset or asset group, a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired assets, difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired assets or use of an asset. A long lived asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If a long lived asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Share Based Compensation. We recognize share based compensation expense for all share based payment awards including employee stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), performance share awards ("PSAs"), and purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") based on each awards fair value on the grant date. We utilize the Black Scholes Merton (BSM) option pricing model in order to determine the fair value of stock options and ESPP. The BSM model requires various highly subjective assumptions including volatility, expected award life, and risk free interest rate. The expected volatility is based on the implied volatility of market traded options on our common stock, adjusted for other relevant factors including historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock options. The expected life of an award is based on historical experience, the terms and conditions of the stock awards granted to employees, and the potential effect from options that have not been exercised. We determine the fair value of RSUs and PSAs based on the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date. In addition, we use significant judgment in estimating share based compensation expense for our PSAs based on the vesting criteria and only recognize expense for the portions in which annual targets have been set. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent managements best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of managements judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. Additionally, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate based on historical experience as well as judgment and recognize expense only for those expected to vest shares. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, our recorded share based compensation expense could be different. Income Taxes. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates may differ from the statutory rate due to factors such as, but not limited to, foreign operations, R&D tax credits, tax audit settlements, changes in the valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets, non deductible compensation, and transfer pricing adjustments. Our effective tax rate was 25.7%, 20.4%, and 63.1% for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserves and any changes to the reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties, if applicable. Estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences and carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income. To the extent that we believe any amounts are not more likely than not to be realized through the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and future income, we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets. In the event we determine that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance is charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Similarly, if we subsequently realize deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation allowance is reversed, resulting in an adjustment to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize and measure potential liabilities based upon our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. Significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with 36Table of Contentsa corresponding effect to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. Loss Contingencies. We use significant judgment and assumptions to estimate the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset, or the incurrence of a liability, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We record a charge equal to the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the range of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required. From time to time, we are involved in disputes, litigation, and other legal actions. We are aggressively defending our current litigation matters. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and these actions or other third party claims against us may cause us to incur costly litigation and or substantial settlement charges. In addition, the resolution of any future intellectual property litigation may require us to make royalty payments, which could adversely affect gross margins in future periods. If any of those events were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected. The actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses. For a discussion of current litigation, please see under the heading "Legal Proceedings" in Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on financial condition and results of operations, which is incorporated herein by reference. Results of OperationsThe following table presents product and service net revenues (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 $ Change % Change 2010 2009 $ Change % ChangeNet revenues: Product$3,478.3 $3,258.7 $219.6 7% $3,258.7 $2,568.0 $690.7 27%Percentage of net revenues78.2% 79.6% 79.6% 77.4% Service970.4 834.6 135.8 16% 834.6 747.9 86.7 12%Percentage of net revenues21.8% 20.4% 20.4% 22.6% Total net revenues$4,448.7 $4,093.3 $355.4 9% $4,093.3 $3,315.9 $777.4 23%Our net product revenue increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in sales of our Infrastructure routing products, particularly the MX Series routers, to service provider and enterprise customers across all regions, reflecting our competitive position and customers demand for our edge products. Our switching products, including EX Series, QFabric and WLAN products, increased due to strength in our EX Series products, both in data center and campus deployments. We also recorded initial revenues from the first deployment of our QFabric solution. The increase in Infrastructure revenue was partially offset by the decline in revenue from the M and T Series routers primarily attributable to weaker overall demand from service providers driven by uncertain macroeconomic environment as well as an expected pause as we introduce the T4000 router. SLT product revenue also had a slight decrease in 2011, compared to 2010, primarily attributed to the decline in our high end product lines influenced by the timing of our high end SRX service provider deployments and the transition from older enterprise security products to our new security product portfolio. Service revenue increased in 2011, primarily attributable to sales of our MX Series routers and EX Series switches, primarily attributable to sales and contract renewals for our MX Series routers, EX Series switches and High End SRX products.Our net product revenues increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in Infrastructure product sales to service provider and enterprise customers across all regions, SLT product sales to enterprise customers across all regions and 37Table of ContentsSLT product sales to service provider customers in the Americas. The increased revenue was the result of increased demand for our most recent product lines, the MX Series routers, EX Series switches, and SRX service gateways, as well as the improved macroeconomic environment as compared to 2009. Additionally our net service revenues increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to an increase in sales to enterprise customers across all regions and to service provider customers in the EMEA and APAC regions, which was primarily driven by growth in the installed base and continued strength in contract renewals for support services.Net Revenues by Market and CustomerThe following table presents the total net revenues by market (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 $ Change % Change 2010 2009 $ Change % ChangeService Provider$2,833.0 $2,631.5 $201.5 8% $2,631.5 $2,197.1 $434.4 20%Percentage of net revenues63.7% 64.3% 64.3% 66.3% Enterprise1,615.7 1,461.8 153.9 11% 1,461.8 1,118.8 343.0 31%Percentage of net revenues36.3% 35.7% 35.7% 33.7% Total$4,448.7 $4,093.3 $355.4 9% $4,093.3 $3,315.9 $777.4 23%We sell our high performance network products and service offerings from our Infrastructure and SLT segments to two primary markets service provider and enterprise. Determination of which market a particular revenue transaction relates to is based primarily upon the customers industrial classification code, but may also include judgmental factors such as the intended use of the product. The service provider market generally includes wireline, wireless, and cable operators, as well as major Internet content and application providers, including those that provide social networking and search engine services. The enterprise market generally comprises businesses; federal, state, and local governments; and research and education institutions.Net revenue increased in 2011 attributable to the increase in sales to the service provider market across all three geographic regions, specifically in the Americas and EMEA regions. The increase was largely attributable to customers adoption of our Infrastructure products, including the MX Series routers, EX Series switches and WLAN products, across all three regions, slightly offset by a decline in the SLT products in the Americas. Net revenues from sales to the service provider market increased in absolute dollars in 2010 compared 2009, primarily due to our customers increased investment in new network build outs and purchases of additional networking capacity to support network growth.Revenues from sales to the enterprise market also increased in 2011, compared to 2010, reflecting demand for routing and switching products including the MX Series routers, EX Series switches, and WLAN products driven by the value proposition we offer to customers as well as our strategy of expanding presence in the enterprise market. The increase in enterprise revenues in 2011, was experienced across all three geographic regions. Net revenues from sales to the enterprise market increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to our expanded portfolio of products and our continued investments to expand our footprint in the enterprise market. No customers accounted for greater than 10% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011. Verizon Communications, Inc., accounted for 10.6% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010. AT&T, Inc., accounted for 10.4% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Net revenues in the Americas decreased as a percentage of total revenue from 2010 to 2011, primarily due to the relative strength in EMEA.Net revenues in the Americas region increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to increased demand in the United States. In the United States, net revenues increased in absolute dollars and increased as a percentage of total net revenues, in 2010 compared to 2009, due to the relative strength of the enterprise and service provider markets in the United States. Net revenues in EMEA increased, in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues, in 2011, compared to 2010, driven by service provider and enterprise demand for our routing and switching products and related services, in both service provider and enterprise markets. The increases were largely attributable to Sweden, Eastern Europe, and the Netherlands. In addition, we initiated the first revenue from a top service provider in Eastern Europe spanning a broad range of our product portfolio.Net revenues in EMEA increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to increased demand in Russia, Germany, and the United Kingdom. This increase was largely driven by product sales to both the enterprise and service provider markets.Net revenues in APAC increased in 2011, compared to 2010, due to the increase in revenues from our routing, switching, and SLT products and services, in both service provider and enterprise markets. Revenue increased in Southeast Asia and Australia, partially offset by continued weakness in Japan and push out of some demand in China. Net revenues as a percentage of total revenues remain relatively flat in 2011 compared to 2010.Net revenues in APAC increased in absolute dollars in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to increased demand in Japan, China, and Australia. This increase was primarily driven by product sales to enterprise customers and service sales to service provider customers. Gross MarginsThe following table presents gross margins (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 $ Change % Change 2010 2009 $ Change % ChangeGross margin: Product gross margin$2,323.0 $2,257.8 $65.2 3% $2,257.8 $1,726.3 $531.5 31%Percentage of product revenues66.8% 69.3% 69.3% 67.2% Service gross margin545.6 484.0 61.6 13% 484.0 456.9 27.1 6%Percentage of service revenues56.2% 58.0% 58.0% 61.1% Total gross margin$2,868.6 $2,741.8 $126.8 5% $2,741.8 $2,183.2 $558.6 26%Percentage of net revenues64.5% 67.0% 67.0% 65.8% 39Table of ContentsProduct gross margin percentage decreased in 2011, compared to 2010, primarily due to a lower proportion of router revenue, a shift in the geographic mix of revenue from Americas, increased fixed overhead and inventory related costs. As of December 31, 2011, and 2010, we had 296 and 273 employees, respectively, in our manufacturing and operations organization that primarily manage relationships with our independent contract manufacturers, manage our supply chain, orchestrate new product introductions, and monitor and manage product testing and quality.Product gross margin and product gross margin as a percentage of product revenues in 2010 compared to 2009 increased primarily due to a change in product mix that favored higher margin products and our continued efforts to manage costs. Service gross margin increased in absolute dollars in 2011, compared to 2010, mainly attributed to the 16% growth in service revenue. Service gross margin percentage decreased in 2011, compared to 2010, primarily due to a growth in headcount of 21% to 1,289 employees as of December 31, 2011, compared to 1,064 employees as of December 31, 2010.The higher headcount was due to the increase both service and support resources for our expanded product portfolio.Service gross margin increased in 2010 compared to 2009 in absolute dollars primarily due to increased service revenues, and service gross margin as a percentage of service revenues decreased primarily due to a shift in mix that was driven by an increase in value added service related revenue. Operating ExpensesThe following table presents operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 $ Change % Change 2010 2009 $ Change % ChangeResearch and development$1,026.8 $917.9 $108.9 12% $917.9 $741.7 $176.2 24%Percentage of net revenues23.1% 22.4% 22.4% 22.4% Sales and marketing1,001.1 857.1 144.0 17% 857.1 759.1 98.0 13%Percentage of net revenues22.5% 20.9% 20.9% 22.8% General and administrative179.1 177.9 1.2 1% 177.9 159.5 18.4 12%Percentage of net revenues4.0% 4.3% 4.3% 4.8% Amortization of purchased intangible assets5.4 4.2 1.2 29% 4.2 10.4 (6.2) (59)%Percentage of net revenues0.1% 0.1% 0.1% 0.3% Restructuring and other charges30.6 10.8 19.8 183% 10.8 19.5 (8.7) (44)%Percentage of net revenues0.7% 0.3% 0.3% 0.6% Acquisition related and other charges7.1 6.3 0.8 13% 6.3 6.3 N/MPercentage of net revenues0.2% 0.2% 0.2% % Litigation settlement charges % 182.3 (182.3) (100)%Percentage of net revenues% % % 5.5% Total operating expenses$2,250.1 $1,974.2 $275.9 14% $1,974.2 $1,872.5 $101.7 5%Percentage of net revenues50.6% 48.2% 48.2% 56.4% Personnel related costs, including wages, commissions, bonuses, vacation, benefits, share based compensation, and travel, have historically been the primary driver of our operating expenses, and we expect this trend to continue. Facility and information technology (IT) departmental costs are allocated to other departments based on usage and headcount. Facility and IT related headcount was 375, 388, and 294 as of December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. We had 9,129, 8,772, and 7,231 employees as of December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The year over year increase in 2011 was due to growth across all of our organizations as a result of our efforts to grow the business.R&D expenses increased in 2011, compared to 2010, primarily due to an increase in personnel related expenses of $75.7 million. Also contributing to the increase was higher consulting, facilities and IT costs associated with our R&D projects to support our new product initiatives including the data center, mobility,and core solutions. This increase was partially offset by lower variable compensation in 2011. Our R&D headcount was relatively flat at 4,138 as of December 31, 2011, compared to the prior year, as a result of our restructuring activities in the second half of 2011. R&D expenses increased in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to additional headcount and strategic initiatives to expand 40Table of Contentsour product portfolio. In particular, we focused on delivering optical capabilities and a packet optimized transport system that will help service providers better support packet and IP based services, such as video, mobility and cloud computing. Personnel related costs increased $111.6 million in 2010, primarily due to a 25% increase in headcount in our engineering organization, from 3,308 to 4,132 employees, to support product innovation intended to capture anticipated future network infrastructure growth and opportunities. Additionally, our outside consulting, facilities, and IT costs related to R&D expenses increased to support our R&D efforts. Sales and marketing expenses increased in 2011, compared to 2010, primarily due to an increase in personnel related expenses of $128.5 million. Additionally, contributing to the increase in 2011 was an increase in commission expense driven by higher revenue and an increase in outside services incurred to support our sales and marketing activities. As a result of our restructuring activities in the second half of 2011, sales and marketing headcount increased only 4% from 2,466 employees as of December 31, 2010 to 2,568 employees as of December 31, 2011. Sales and marketing expenses increased in 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, primarily due to our 2010 advertising campaign, events for new product launches, and an increase in personnel related costs of $95.8 million. The increase in personnel related costs was primarily due to a 17% increase in our sales and marketing headcount from 2,101 to 2,466 employees, an increase in variable compensation driven by growth in our revenues, and an increase in outside services to support our sales and marketing programs. As a percentage of net revenues, sales and marketing expenses decreased slightly in 2010 due to our focus on managing expenses and creating efficiency in our sales activities. General and administrative ("G&A") expense was relatively flat in 2011, compared to 2010, as costs associated with the G&A headcount growth of 3% from 449 at December 31, 2010 to 463 at December 31, 2011, were largely offset by lower variable compensation.G&A expenses increased in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to an increase in personnel related expenses. As a percentage of net revenues, G&A expenses decreased slightly in 2010 due to our continued focus on managing expenses. Personnel related costs increased $25.0 million in 2010, primarily due to a 14% increase in headcount, from 393 to 449 employees in our worldwide G&A functions to support expected future growth of the business, as well as higher variable compensation driven by growth in revenues. Additionally, facilities and IT expenses related to our G&A infrastructure increased to support our growing business. Amortization of purchased intangible assets increased in, 2011, compared to 2010, due to the addition of intangible assets from acquisitions during 2011 and 2010. Amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to certain purchased intangible assets reaching the end of their amortization period during 2009. We had no impairment of our goodwill or our purchased intangible assets in 2011 and 2010. We incurred $30.6 million of net restructuring and other charges in 2011 primarily related to a restructuring plan (the "2011 Restructuring Plan") implemented in the third quarter of 2011 to align our business operations with macroeconomic and other market conditions. Restructuring charges of $17.1 million was primarily related to workforce reductions. Remaining liabilities in the 2011 Restructuring Plan, are expected to be paid out in the first half of 2012. As we complete the alignment over the next two quarters, we may incur additional severance and facility costs. Such costs, primarily facility related, may range from $14 million to $21 million. Included in other charges, was a $13.5 million charge related to the impairment of an abandoned in process internal use software project. In 2010 and 2009, we recorded $10.8 million and $19.5 million, respectively, as a result of a restructuring plan to reduce our real estate portfolio and workforce in targeted areas of the Company. As of December 31, 2011, the 2009 Restructuring Plan was complete. See Note 9, Other Financial Information, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for more information regarding our restructuring liabilities. In 2011 and 2010, we recorded $7.1 million and $6.3 million, respectively, in direct and indirect acquisition related costs such as financial advisory, legal, due diligence, and integration costs from acquisitions completed in 2011 and 2010. In 2009, we recorded litigation settlement charges of $182.3 million, which included $169.0 million related to our agreement in principle reached in February 2010, to settle the securities class action litigation pending against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors, $13.0 million related to the resolution of a dispute in connection with certain real estate in Sunnyvale California purchased in 2000 and $0.3 million related to another settlement recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009. Of these amounts, $181.3 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009. See Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for more information. No such charges were incurred in 2010 and 2011.41Table of ContentsShare Based Compensation Share based compensation expense associated with stock options, employee stock purchases, restricted stock units ("RSUs"), and performance share awards ("PSAs") was recorded in the following cost and expense categories (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 $ Change % Change 2010 2009 $ Change % ChangeCost of revenues Product$4.6 $4.4 $0.2 5% $4.4 $3.9 $0.5 13%Cost of revenues Service15.7 13.5 2.2 16% 13.5 10.5 3.0 29%Research and development97.7 78.5 19.2 24% 78.5 59.3 19.2 32%Sales and marketing70.9 54.9 16.0 29% 54.9 43.1 11.8 27%General and administrative33.3 30.7 2.6 8% 30.7 22.9 7.8 34%Total$222.2 $182.0 $40.2 22% $182.0 $139.7 $42.3 30%Share based compensation expense increased in 2011, compared to 2010, primarily due to the increase in award grants driven by headcount growth and higher fair value of equity awards attributable to the increase in the market value of our common stock for those awards. Share based compensation expense increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to an increase in RSU and PSA grants during the period primarily resulting from an increase in the number of participants.

Interest expense increased in 2011, compared to 2010, primarily due to the $37.7 million interest expense on the debt issued in March 2011. Other typically consists of investment and foreign exchange gains and losses and other non operational income and expense items. In 2011, other included certain legal expenses unrelated to current or recent operations of approximately $7.0 million. In 2010, we recognized a total gain of $8.7 million, primarily due to acquisitions of our privately held equity investments in Ankeena and Altor. During 2009 we recognized an impairment loss of $5.5 million on our equity investments for changes in fair value that we believed were other than temporary.Our effective tax rates were 25.7%, 20.4%, and 63.1% in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The effective rate for 2011 differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the federal R&D credit and the benefit of earnings in foreign jurisdictions, which are subject to lower tax rates. The effective tax rate for 2011 differed from 2010 as a result of the items referenced below, which were recognized in 2010.The decrease in overall rate in 2010 compared to 2009, and the federal statutory rate of 35%, was primarily due to the federal R&D credit, the benefit of earnings in foreign jurisdictions, which are subject to lower tax rates, and a $54.1 million income tax benefit in 2010 resulting from a change in the Companys estimate of unrecognized tax benefits due to the taxpayer favorable ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the Court) in Xilinx Inc. v. Commissioner related to share based compensation. The effective tax rate in 2009 was higher than the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following income tax charges: (i) a $61.8 million discrete and other related charge that resulted from changes in California income tax laws that were enacted during 2009; (ii) a $52.1 million charge that resulted from a change in our unrecognized tax benefits related to share 42Table of Contentsbased compensation; and (iii) a $4.6 million charge which related to an investigation by the India tax authorities. The effective rate impact from these charges was partially offset by the federal R&D credit and the benefit of earnings in foreign jurisdictions, which are subject to lower tax rates. For a complete reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and further explanation of our income tax provision, see Note 14, Income Taxes, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K.Segment InformationFor a description of the products and services for each segment, see Item 1 Business, in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10 K.

The number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the functionality and throughput offered by the module. Excludes modular and fixed configuration EX Series Ethernet switching products, circuit to packet products, and timing servers.(2)A reconciliation of total segment operating income to income before taxes and noncontrolling interest can be found in Note 13, Segments, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement in Item 8 of this Form 10 K.In 2011, Infrastructure products revenue increased across all three regions in both the service provider and enterprise markets. These increases were primarily from sales of our routing and switching products such as MX Series routers, EX Series switches and WLAN. The increase in Infrastructure service revenue in 2011, was primarily driven by strong contract renewals for support services and increased installed base from our Infrastructure product sales. Infrastructure operating income decreased as a percent of Infrastructure revenue in 2011, compared to 2010, was largely due to the decline in product margins and higher operating expenses, partially offset by lower variable compensation in 2011. We track Infrastructure chassis revenue units and ports shipped to analyze customer trends and indicate areas of potential network growth. Most of our Infrastructure product platforms are modular, with the chassis serving as the base of the platform. Each modular chassis has a certain number of slots that are available to be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces. The modules are the components through which the platform receives incoming packets of data from a variety of transmission media. The physical connection between a transmission medium and a module is referred to as a port. The number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the functionality and throughput offered by the module. Chassis revenue units 43Table of Contentsrepresent the number of chassis on which revenue was recognized during the period. Infrastructure chassis revenue units increased in 2011, compared to 2010, primarily due to the increase in shipments of our MX Series routers, particularly the mid range MX product lines. The increase in shipments of the mid range MX product lines, which generally contain a higher number of ports per chassis, drove the higher number of ports shipped in 2011, compare to 2010.In 2010, Infrastructure products revenue experienced growth in the enterprise and service provider markets across all regions compared to 2009. This increase was primarily attributable to revenue growth from our MX Series routers and EX Series switches. The increased demand for our products was primarily due to growing network demand attributable to increased reliance on digital devices connected to the network, and to a lesser extent, the improved macroeconomic environment. Infrastructure chassis revenue units increased in 2010 compared to 2009, which was commensurate with Infrastructure product revenue growth during the year. Infrastructure port shipments increased in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to the continued growth in sales of MX Series products, which generally contain a higher number of ports per chassis. A majority of our service revenue is earned from customers that purchase our products and enter into support services contracts for support. Infrastructure service revenues increased in 2010 compared to 2009, which was primarily driven by increased revenue from new product sales and strong contract renewals for support services. From a geographical and market perspective, the increase in Infrastructure service revenues was primarily due to an increase in enterprise business across all regions and service provider business in the EMEA and APAC regions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in service revenue in the Americas service provider market.Infrastructure operating income increased as a percent of Infrastructure revenue in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to a higher gross margin percentage, which was attributable to changes in product mix that favored higher margin products. Additionally, although Infrastructure sales and marketing expenses increased in absolute dollars as we increased our efforts to reach enterprise and service provider customers, they decreased as a percentage of Infrastructure revenues.SLT Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 $ Change % Change 2010 2009 $ Change % Change (in millions, except percentages and units)SLT segment revenues: SLT product revenue$697.7 $747.1 $(49.4) (7)% $747.1 $608.8 $138.3 23%Percentage of net revenues15.7% 18.3% 18.3% 18.4% SLT service revenue328.4 295.9 32.5 11% 295.9 265.5 30.4 11%Percentage of net revenues7.4% 7.2% 7.2% 8.0% Total SLT segment revenues$1,026.1 $1,043.0 $(16.9) (2)% $1,043.0 $874.3 $168.7 19%Percentage of net revenues23.1% 25.5% 25.5% 26.4% SLT revenue units252,848 231,365 21,483 9% 231,365 208,907 22,458 11% SLT operating income (1)$199.0 $208.0 $(9.0) (4)% $208.0 $127.0 $81.0 64%Percentage of SLT revenues19.4% 19.9% 19.9% 14.5% (1) A reconciliation of total segment operating income to income before taxes and noncontrolling interest can be found in Note 13, Segments, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement in Item 8 of this Form 10 K.SLT product revenues decreased in 2011, compared to 2010, which was largely driven by a decrease in revenue from our High End SRX, High End Firewall and Branch Firewall products, partially offset by an increase in our Branch SRX revenue. The decline was primarily experienced in the Americas service provider market. Although SLT product revenue decreased in 2011, revenue units increased due to the higher sales of our lower priced branch products. The increase in SLT service revenue in 2011, compared to 2010, was primarily driven by strong contract renewals for support services in both the service provider and enterprise markets across all regions.SLT operating income decreased as a percent of revenue in 2011, compared to 2010, primarily due to decline in revenue and shift to lower margin products. 44Table of ContentsWe experienced an increase in SLT product revenue in the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, primarily due to increased demand for our branch and high end SRX service gateway products. From a geographical and market perspective, we experienced revenue growth in the Americas service provider market and across all regions in the enterprise market in 2010.SLT revenue units increased in 2010 compared to 2009, which was commensurate with growth in SLT product revenue. The percentage increase in SLT revenue units was less than the increase in SLT product revenues due to a product mix that favored higher average selling prices. The increase in SLT service revenue in 2010 compared to 2009, was primarily driven by increased revenue from new product sales and strong contract renewals for support services. From a geographical and market perspective, the increase in SLT service revenues was due to growth in the enterprise and service provider markets across all regions. SLT operating income increased as a percent of revenue in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses as a percent of SLT revenue as we continued our efforts to carefully manage costs. Additionally, the increase was attributable to higher gross margin percentage resulting from changes in product mix and efficiencies achieved from the higher 2010 revenues.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesHistorically, we have funded our business primarily through our operating activities and the issuance of our common stock, and more recently, the issuance of long term debt. The following table shows our capital resources (in millions, except percentages and days sales outstanding): As of December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 Change % ChangeWorking capital$2,973.0 $1,742.4 $1,230.6 71%Days sales outstanding46 45 1 2% Cash and cash equivalents$2,910.4 $1,811.9 $1,098.5 61%Short term investments641.3 474.5 166.8 35%Long term investments740.7 535.2 205.5 38%Total cash, cash equivalents and investments4,292.4 2,821.6 1,470.8 52%Long term debt999.0 999.0 N/MNet cash, cash equivalents, and investments$3,293.4 $2,821.6 $471.8 17% N/M Not meaningfulThe significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, and accounts receivable, reduced by accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and short term deferred revenue. Working capital increased by $1,230.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to a higher cash and cash equivalent balance as a result of our $1.0 billion debt offering in March 2011.Summary of Cash FlowsAs of December 31, 2011, our cash and cash equivalents increased by $1,098.5 million from December 31, 2010. This increase was mainly the result of cash generated by our operating and financing activities of $986.7 million and $819.0 million, respectively, partially offset by cash used in investing activities of $707.2 million.Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities was $986.7 million, $812.3 million, and $796.1 million, for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Cash flows from operations increased by $174.4 million in 2011, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the one time litigation settlement payment of $169.3 million in 2010 which did not occur in 2011. The increase was partially offset by lower consolidated net income in 2011. For 2010, operating cash flows increased by $16.2 million from 2009, primarily due to higher consolidated net income, partially offset by litigation settlement payments, prepaid taxes, and higher accounts 45Table of Contentsreceivable. Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities was $707.2 million, $532.8 million, and $948.3 million, in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. During 2011, we invested the proceeds from our March 2011 debt offering in available for sale securities and purchased property and equipment for the build out of our new headquarter campus in Sunnyvale, CA. The change in net cash used in investing activities from 2009 to 2010 was primarily due to net cash paid for acquisitions in 2010.Financing ActivitiesNet cash generated in financing activities was $819.0 million in 2011, and net cash used were $72.4 million, and $262.2 million for 2010, and 2009, respectively. We generated additional cash from financing activities in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the issuance of our long term debt on March 5, 2011, partially offset by the repurchase of our outstanding common stock. For further discussion of our long term debt, see Note 10, Financing, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. In 2010, we used additional cash in financing activities to repurchase our outstanding common stock through our stock repurchase programs, partially offset by cash proceeds from issuance of common stock to employees as a result of higher stock prices. Stock Repurchase ActivitiesIn February 2010, our Board of Directors (the "Board") approved a stock repurchase program (the 2010 Stock Repurchase Program), which authorized us to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock. This authorization was in addition to the stock repurchase program approved by the Board in March 2008 (the 2008 Stock Repurchase Program), which also enabled us to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock.We repurchased and retired approximately 17.5 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $30.93 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $541.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2011, under our 2010 Stock Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2011, there were no remaining authorized funds under the 2008 Stock Repurchase Program and $213.8 million remaining authorized funds under the 2010 Stock Repurchase Program.Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We had no off balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2011, and 2010.Contractual Obligations Our principal commitments consist of obligations outstanding under operating leases, purchase commitments, tax liabilities, and other contractual obligations. The following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in millions): Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years OtherOperating leases (1)$352.7 $57.9 $167.9 $70.7 $56.2 $Purchase commitments (2)150.6 $150.6 Tax liabilities (3)108.5 108.5Long term debt (4)1,000.0 300.0 700.0 $Interest payment on long term debt (4)873.1 46.9 93.8 88.8 643.6 Other contractual obligations (5)73.1 63.3 9.8 Total$2,558.0 $318.7 $271.5 $459.5 $1,399.8 $108.5 (1)Our contractual obligations under operating leases primarily relate to our leased facilities under our non cancelable operating leases. Rent payments are allocated to costs and operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. We occupy approximately 2.5 million square feet worldwide under operating leases. The majority of our office space is in North America, including our corporate headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. Our longest lease expires on November 30, 2022.(2)In order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply, our contract manufacturers place non cancelable, non returnable (NCNR) orders for components based on our build forecasts. The contract manufacturers use the components to build products based on our forecasts 46Table of Contentsand on purchase orders we have received from our customers. Generally, we do not own the components and title to the product transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon delivery at a designated shipment location. If the components go unused or the products go unsold for specified periods of time, we may incur carrying charges or obsolete materials charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders. As of December 31, 2011, we had accrued $14.8 million based on our estimate of such charges. Total purchase commitments as of December 31, 2011, consisted of $150.6 million of NCNR orders.(3)Tax liabilities include $108.5 million of long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet for unrecognized tax positions. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments related to this amount due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.(4)In March 2011, we issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.10% senior notes due 2016 (the "2016 notes"), $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.60% senior notes due 2021 (the "2021 notes"), and $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.95% senior notes due 2041 (the "2041 notes" and, together with the 2016 notes and the 2021 notes the "notes"). Interest on the notes is payable in cash semiannually. We may redeem the notes, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, subject to a make whole premium, and, in the event of a change in control, the holders of the notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or part of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principle amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The indenture that governs the notes also contains various covenants, including limitations on the our ability to incur liens or enter into sale leaseback transactions over certain dollar thresholds.(5) Other contractual obligations primarily consisted of $25.1 million in indemnity related and service related escrows, required by certain acquisitions completed in 2005, 2010 and 2011, $30.7 million in campus build out obligations, and other miscellaneous commitments. GuaranteesWe have entered into agreements with customers that contain indemnification provisions relating to potential situations where claims could be alleged that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party. We also have financial guarantees consisting of guarantees of product and service performance, guarantees related to third party customer financing arrangements, customs and duties guarantees, and standby letters of credit for certain lease facilities. As of December 31, 2011, and 2010, we had $19.9 million and $21.6 million, respectively, in bank guarantees and standby letters of credit related to these financial guarantees.Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements Liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our operating activities as well as acquisitions and investments in strategic relationships that we have made or we may make in the future. Additionally, if we were to repurchase additional shares of our common stock under the 2010 Stock Repurchase Program, our liquidity may be impacted. As of December 31, 2011, 49% of our cash and investment balances are held outside of the U.S., which may be subject to U.S. taxes if repatriated.In August 2010, we filed a $1.5 billion shelf registration with the SEC. In March 2011, we issued notes in the amount of $1.0 billion under the shelf registration statement. Therefore, while we have no current plans to do so, we may issue up to $500 million in additional securities under the shelf registration statement. The shelf registration is intended to give us flexibility to take advantage of financing opportunities as needed or deemed desirable in light of market conditions. Any additional offerings of securities under the shelf registration statement will be made pursuant to a prospectus.We have been focused on managing our annual equity usage as a percentage of the common stock outstanding to align with peer group competitive levels and have made changes in recent years to reduce the number of shares underlying the equity awards we grant. Our intention for fiscal year 2011 was to target the number of shares underlying equity awards granted on an annual basis at less than three percent (3%) of our common stock outstanding. Based upon shares underlying our grants to date of options, RSUs, and PSAs (counting only the on target measure of such PSAs), we achieved the goal for 2011. We have also managed our equity compensation programs to reduce the overall number of shares subject to outstanding awards over the past two years. The total number of common shares subject to our outstanding option, RSU, and PSA awards was 58.2 million, 63.5 million, and 76.5 million shares as of December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, reflecting a consecutive decline for the three years ended December 31, 2011. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short term, and long term investments (which includes the proceeds of the issuance of the notes), together with cash generated from operations as well as cash generated from the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan will be sufficient to fund our operations and anticipated growth for at least the next 12 months. We believe our working capital is sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for capital expenditures, commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations during the same period. However, our future liquidity and capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending on many factors, including:level and mix of our product, sales, and gross profit margins;our business, product, capital expenditures and R&D plans;repurchases of our common stock;incurrence and repayment of debt and related interest obligations;47Table of Contentslitigation expenses, settlements, and judgments, or similar items related to resolution of tax audits;volume price discounts and customer rebates;accounts receivable levels that we maintain;acquisitions and or funding of other businesses, assets, products, or technologies;changes in our compensation policies;capital improvements for new and existing facilities;technological advances;our competitors responses to our products and or pricing;our relationships with supplies, partners, and customers;possible future investments in raw material and finished goods inventories;expenses related to future restructuring plans, if any;tax expense associated with share based awards;issuance of share based awards and the related payment in cash for withholding taxes in the current year and possibly during future years;level of exercises of stock options and stock purchases under our equity incentive plans; andgeneral economic conditions and specific conditions in our industry and markets, including the effects of disruptions in global credit and financial markets, international conflicts, and related uncertainties.ITEM 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market RiskInterest Rate Risk We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. The value of our investments is subject to market price volatility. In addition, as of December 31, 2011, 49% of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are held in non U.S. domiciled countries. Our marketable securities are generally classified as available for sale and, consequently, are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). At any time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio. Conversely, a decline in interest rates could have a material impact on interest income from our investment portfolio. We do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures. We recognized immaterial gains and losses during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, related to the sales of our investments. The following tables present hypothetical changes in fair value of the financial instruments held at December 31, 2011, and 2010, that are sensitive to changes in interest rates (in millions): 48Table of Contents Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Rate Decrease of X BPS Fair Value as of December 31, 2011 Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Rate Increase of X BPS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS Government treasury and agencies$740.4 $737.6 $734.8 $731.9 $729.2 $726.4 $723.6Corporate bonds and notes516.8 514.1 511.4 508.7 506.0 503.3 500.5Other1,572.0 1,571.4 1,570.8 1,570.3 1,569.7 1,569.1 1,568.7Total$2,829.2 $2,823.1 $2,817.0 $2,810.9 $2,804.9 $2,798.8 $2,792.8 Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Rate Decrease of X BPS Fair Value as of December 31, 2010 Valuation of Securities Given an Interest Rate Increase of X BPS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS Government treasury and agencies$457.4 $456.3 $455.1 $454.1 $452.8 $451.7 $450.5Corporate bonds and notes469.9 467.2 464.4 461.7 459.0 456.2 453.5Foreign government debt securities47.8 47.5 47.3 47.0 46.8 46.5 46.3Other1,291.6 1,291.2 1,290.7 1,290.1 1,289.7 1,289.2 1,288.7Total$2,266.7 $2,262.2 $2,257.5 $2,252.9 $2,248.3 $2,243.6 $2,239.0 These instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading. The modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (BPS), 100 BPS, and 150 BPS, which are representative of the historical movements in the Federal Funds Rate. Foreign Currency Risk and Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts Periodically, we use derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the re measurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies. These derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other income (expense) in the same period as the changes in the fair value from the re measurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. These foreign exchange contracts have maturities of one year or less. Our sales and costs of product revenues are primarily denominated in U.S. Dollars. Our cost of service revenue and operating expenses are denominated in U.S. Dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the British Pound, the Euro, Indian Rupee, and Japanese Yen. Approximately 76% of such costs and operating expenses are denominated in U.S. Dollars. Periodically, we use foreign currency forward and or option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions to reduce variability in cost of service revenue and operating expenses caused by non U.S. Dollar denominated operating expense and costs. In designing a specific hedging approach, we consider several factors, including offsetting exposures, significance of exposures, costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument, and potential effectiveness of the hedge. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of less than one year. The effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and, upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction, is subsequently reclassified into the line item in the consolidated statements of operations to which the hedged transaction relates. We record the ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments, which was immaterial during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, in other income (expense) on our consolidated statements of operations. The change in operating expenses including cost of service revenue, R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses, due to foreign currency fluctuations was approximately 1%, 1%, and 2% in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. If overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the U.S. Dollar uniformly changes by 10%, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities we would report in U.S. Dollars would change by less than 1%, assuming constant foreign currency cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances. Equity Price Risk Our portfolio of publicly traded equity securities and our non qualified deferred compensation (NQDC) plan, which may 49Table of Contentsalso hold publicly traded equity securities, are inherently exposed to equity price risk as the stock market fluctuates. Our publicly traded equity securities are classified as available for sale securities on our consolidated balance sheets. Investments under the NQDC plan are considered trading securities and are also reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet. We do not purchase our publicly traded equity securities with the intent to use them for speculative purposes. As of December 31, 2011, and 2010, the total investments under the NQDC plan were $9.3 million and $8.1 million, respectively. A hypothetical 30% adverse change on the total investments under the NQDC plan as of December 31, 2011, and 2010 would result in an immaterial loss. We have also invested in privately held companies. These investments are carried at cost. In 2011, there were impairment charge of $1.8 million on our investments in privately held companies that we judged to be other than temporary as discussed in Note 5, Fair Value Measurements, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. There were no such charges in 2010. The aggregate cost of our investments in privately held companies was $51.8 million and $22.1 million as of December 31, 2011, and 2010, respectively. 50Table of Contents
