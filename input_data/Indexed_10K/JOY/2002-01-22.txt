Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations As is more fully discussed in Note 2 Basis of Presentation and Fresh Start Accounting in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company adopted fresh start accounting pursuant to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 90 7, "Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization Under the Bankruptcy Code" ("SOP 90 7"), during the third quarter of fiscal 2001 resulting in a change in the basis of accounting in the underlying assets and liabilities of the Company at the Effective Date. Accordingly, the financial statements of the Successor Company and the Predecessor Company are not comparable. For purposes of this Managements Discussion and Analysis, the Company has combined the actual results of operations for the Successor Company 2001 Four Months and the Predecessor Company 2001 Eight Months as pro forma combined 2001 operating results ("Pro forma Combined 2001") in order to present a meaningful comparative analysis to prior fiscal year operating results. The Successor Company 2001 Four Months and the Predecessor Company 2001 Eight Months financial information is derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition to the basis in accounting differences noted above, the operating results of the Company for Pro forma Combined 2001 and fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999 were significantly impacted by items associated with the Predecessor Company bankruptcy including extraordinary debt forgiveness, restructuring activities, pre petition lawsuit settlements, other charges related to certain bankruptcy activities and certain changes in accounting estimates recorded in the third quarter of 1999; and, by the Successor Company charges related to recognizing the effects of additional depreciation, amortization and cost of sales arising from the revaluation of the Companys assets at the Effective Date. 2001 Compared with 2000 The following table sets forth the Pro forma Combined 2001 and fiscal 2000 net sales of the Company as derived from the Consolidated Statement of Operations: SuccessorPredecessor Company Company Pro forma 2001 Four 2001 Eight Combined Fiscal In thousands Months Months 2001 2000 Net Sales Underground Mining Machinery $ 238,548 $ 436,045$ 674,593 $ 614,356 Surface Mining Equipment169,167 304,413 473,580 508,785 Total $ 407,715 $ 740,458 $1,148,173 $1,123,141 Net sales in 2001 were 2.2% higher than net sales in 2000. A $60.2 million increase in shipments in the Underground Mining Machinery segment was partially offset by a $35.2 million decrease in net sales for Surface Mining Equipment. The increase in Underground Mining Machinery net sales in 2001 was a result of a slight improvement in new machine shipments combined with strong performance for replacement parts sales and component repairs. The improved new machine sales were due primarily to the beginning of the recovery from the depressed markets for continuous miners and shuttle cars in the United States and South Africa, while the sales of longwall equipment remained at about the same level as fiscal 2000. In the aftermarket, favorable results for replacement parts were achieved in the United States where coal producers saw an improvement in the price they received for their coal production, and in the Chinese market, served out of the United Kingdom, where the mining equipment that has been placed over the last decade has begun to be rebuilt and to use replacement parts for the rebuilding process. The decrease in Surface Mining Equipment net sales in 2001 was due to a decrease in the shipment of new equipment, primarily electric mining shovels, partially offset by an increase in replacement part sales. The decrease in electric mining shovels was due to the depressed market for copper and iron ore, which resulted in lower new machine sales to North and South American customers. In the aftermarket, increased sales for replacement parts were achieved in North and South America as equipment was rebuilt and sales of other equipment suppliers products continued to increase. In addition, the sale of refurbished electric mining shovels to customers served by the Australian operation benefited the 2001 fiscal year. The following table sets forth the elements of Pro forma Combined 2001 operating income (loss) of the Company as compared with fiscal 2000. Actual operating results, as derived from the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations, have been adjusted to reflect the impacts of fresh start accounting charges, pre petition lawsuit settlements, and restructuring and other special charges: Successor Predecessor Company Company Pro forma 2001 Four 2001 Eight Combined Fiscal In thousands Months Months 2001 2000 Operating income (loss): Underground Mining Machinery $ (28,426) $ 30,269 $ 1,843 $ 16,956 Surface Mining Equipment (17,738)23,902 6,164 57,432 Corporate Expense (6,091) (10,215)(16,306) (16,368) Total $ (52,255) $ 43,956 $ (8,299) $ 58,020 Adjustments to operating income (loss): Fresh Start Accounting Items $ 87,724 $ Pre petition Lawsuit Settlements 975 11,365 Restructuring and Other Special Charges (58) 4,518 Total $ 88,641 $ 15,883 Adjusted operating income (loss): Underground Mining Machinery $ 59,583 $ 32,639 Surface Mining Equipment 37,065 57,632 Corporate Expense (16,306) (16,368) Total $ 80,342 $ 73,903 The fresh start accounting charges consist of a $74.6 million charge for the increase to fair value of inventory that was taken to cost of sales, $4.4 million of additional depreciation expense associated with the revalued property, plant and equipment, and $8.7 million of amortization expense related to the valuation of certain identifiable finite lived intangible assets. The following discussion is based on adjusted operating income (loss) for Pro forma Combined fiscal 2001 as compared with Fiscal 2000 as presented in the above table. Operating income increased from $73.9 million in fiscal 2000 to $80.3 million in fiscal 2001. This improvement was the result of a $26.9 million increase in operating profit for the Underground Mining Machinery business that was largely offset by a $20.6 million decrease in operating profit for the Surface Mining Equipment business. The increase in operating profit for Underground Mining Machinery was due to an increase in net sales, a favorable sales mix that included a larger percentage of replacement parts sales, an increase in manufacturing overhead absorption, and continued benefits of cost reduction programs put in place over the last several years. The improvement in the sales mix, combined with the increase in manufacturing overhead absorption associated with an increase in manufacturing activities in this segments manufacturing facilities resulted in an increase in gross profit percentage from 23.2% in fiscal 2000 to 27.8% in 2001. Despite a 10% increase in net sales and the impact of general inflation around the world, the Underground Mining Machinery business was able to limit the increase in spending for selling, engineering, and administrative expense to 1.3% in fiscal 2001 compared to 2000. Operating profit for Surface Mining Equipment decreased from $57.6 million in fiscal 2000 to $37.1 million in 2001. This decrease was the result of the decrease in net sales, lower manufacturing overhead absorption, and a slight increase in administrative expense, all of which were partially offset by an improvement in sales mix to include a larger percentage of parts sales during 2001 compared with a year ago. The benefits of the improvement in the sales mix were more than offset by the decrease in manufacturing overhead absorption associated with the decrease in the production of new machines in this segments manufacturing facilities and resulted in a decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales from 23.3% in fiscal 2000 to 21.5% in 2001. Administrative expense was slightly higher in 2001 than in fiscal 2000 due to initiatives associated with expanding distribution capabilities and a small charge in the fourth quarter of 2001 for headcount reductions which will continue into the first quarter of 2002 as the business responds to the near term softness in the market for electric mining shovels. During the third quarter of fiscal 2001 the Companys reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code was completed. As a result of emerging from Chapter 11, the Predecessor Company 2001 Eight Months includes a number of charges and credits associated with the implementation of the Amended POR and the application of fresh start accounting. The following table provides a summary of these charges and credits and the respective line on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the Predecessor Company 2001 Eight Months that were affected: Interest Fresh Start Income TaxDebt Discontinued In millions Expense Accounting Benefit Discharge Operations Interest on pre petition claims $ 14.9 $ $ $ $ Reinstated pre petition IRBs 2.5 Inventory revaluation (156.8) Fixed asset revaluation (93.3) Eliminate previous goodwill 310.1 Record value of intangibles (234.4) Record excess reorganization value (22.5) Pension liabilities revaluation 141.9 Postretirement benefits revaluation 8.5 Revised tax liability estimate 1.4 (35.0) Gain on debt discharge (1,124.1) Gain on divestiture of Beloit, net (253.2) Total (income) expense $ 17.4 $ (45.1) $ (35.0) $ (1,124.1) $ (253.2) 2000 Compared with 1999 The following table sets forth the net sales of the Company included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations: Fiscal Fiscal In thousands 2000 1999 Net Sales Underground Mining Machinery $ 614,356 $ 617,543 Surface Mining Equipment 508,785 501,509 Total $ 1,123,141 $ 1,119,052 Net sales in fiscal 2000 were approximately the same amount as net sales in 1999, with a slight increase in Surface Mining Equipment shipments being substantially offset by a slight decrease in Underground Mining Machinery net sales. In the Underground Mining Machinery business, higher sales of new equipment in the United States substantially offset lower sales of new equipment in markets outside of the U.S. The increase in new equipment sales in the U.S. was attributable to increases in the sales of longwall mining related equipment. The decrease in non U.S. new equipment sales was due to a decrease in the sales of longwall mining related equipment. Even though the global market for the segments new equipment did not improve significantly, market conditions stabilized from the conditions that caused the reduction in new equipment sales in 1999. Aftermarket sales were flat in 2000 as compared to 1999. Increases in complete machine rebuilds in the United States and increases in replacement part sales into China were partially offset by lower aftermarket sales in South Africa. The decrease in aftermarket sales in South Africa was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the South African rand and the corresponding impact on the translation of South African aftermarket sales denominated in rand into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. Net sales for Surface Mining Equipment were slightly higher in 2000 compared to 1999. There was an increase in new equipment shipments, primarily electric shovels, partially offset by a decrease in aftermarket sales. The increase in electric mining shovels was the result of product innovation and high levels of support for customers. The decrease in aftermarket sales was primarily due to mine closures and production cutbacks. The following table sets forth the elements of operating income (loss) for fiscal 2000 compared with fiscal 1999 adjusted to reflect the impacts of change in accounting estimates, pre petition lawsuit settlements, and restructuring and other special charges: Fiscal Fiscal In thousands 2000 1999 Operating income (loss): Underground Mining Machinery $ 16,956 $ (65,893) Surface Mining Equipment 57,432 33,976 Corporate Expense (16,368) (50,597) Total $ 58,020 $ (82,514) Adjustments to operating income (loss): Change in Accounting Estimates$ $ 68,520 Pre petition Lawsuit Settlements11,365 Restructuring and Other Special Charges4,518 38,811 Total$ 15,883 $ 107,331 Adjusted operating income (loss): Underground Mining Machinery $ 32,639 $ 9,624 Surface Mining Equipment57,632 38,976 Corporate Expense(16,368) (23,783) Total $ 73,903 $ 24,817 During the bankruptcy process the Company made every attempt to resolve outstanding litigation issues and arrive at settlements before it emerged from bankruptcy, the amounts in the preceding table reflect the charges that were associated with these settlements. During the third quarter of fiscal 1999 the Company filed for protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and as a result incurred $68.5 million of charges associated with changes in accounting estimates for accounts receivable, inventories, and potential warranty expense. In addition, during 1999 and the first quarter of 2000, the Underground Mining Machinery business incurred costs associated with the elimination of manufacturing capacity and the restructuring of its global operations to be more consistent with the existing level of market opportunities. After the adjustments listed in the table above, operating profit increased from $24.8 million in 1999 to $73.9 million in fiscal 2000. This increase in operating profit was due to the improved operating results for both of the Companys business segments combined with a reduction in corporate expense. The improvement in Underground Mining Machinery operating profit, despite a slight decline in net sales in fiscal 2000 compared to a year earlier, was the result of the cost reduction programs that were initiated late in fiscal 1998. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was approximately 23% for both years as the business was able to maintain its price realization in soft markets for underground mining equipment. The results of the businesss ongoing cost reduction efforts during fiscal 2000 were a $24 million reduction in the spending for selling, engineering, administration, and manufacturing overhead in fiscal 2000 compared with 1999. The increase in operating profit for Surface Mining Equipment from $39 million in 1999 to $57.6 million in 2000 was the result of the increase in new machine shipments and the increase in manufacturing overhead absorption that was associated with the increase in the production of new machines in the businesss manufacturing facility. The increase in this overhead absorption contributed to the increase in the gross profit percentage from 20.4% in 1999 to 23.3 % in 2000. In addition, spending for selling, engineering, and administration was $7 million less in 2000 than spending in 1999, as the business was successful in controlling these expenses. Future Effects of Fresh Start Accounting The charges reflected in the Companys statement of operations related to the effects of fresh start accounting adjustments are non cash items and, accordingly, do not affect the Companys cash flows from operations. The Company estimates the effects of fresh start accounting on 2002 operating results will include charges of $51.3 million related to the revalued inventory (primarily in the first quarter of fiscal 2002), $13.3 million for depreciation of revalued property, plant and equipment, and $13.9 million for amortization of finite lived intangible assets. The Company estimates the total fresh start accounting charges in 2003 and several years thereafter to approximate $20 million annually. Restructuring and Other Special Charges During 1999, the Company recorded $12.0 million of restructuring charges related to rationalization of certain of Joys original equipment manufacturing facilities and the reorganization and reduction of its world wide operating structure. Costs of $7.3 million were charged in the third quarter of fiscal 1999, primarily related to the impairment of certain assets related to a facility rationalization, and $4.7 million ($0.9 million third quarter and $3.8 million fourth quarter) were made for severance of approximately 240 employees. During 2000, the Company recorded $6.1 million in additional charges related to Joys reorganization and rationalization primarily related to employee severance. A prior reserve of $1.6 million was reversed during 2000 as it was no longer needed for facility rationalization. The residual reserve of $1.7 million at October 31, 2000 was utilized prior to the Effective Date. During 1999, the Company incurred $7.7 million of charges related to certain consulting and legal costs associated with strategic financing and business alternatives investigated prior to the Chapter 11 filing. The Company recorded a charge of $19.1 million during the third quarter of 1999 in connection with certain management organizational changes. The charge was primarily associated with supplemental retirement, restricted stock, and long term compensation obligations related to former Company officers. Also during the third quarter of 1999, the Company recorded certain charges related to changes in accounting estimates for provisions for excess and obsolete inventory, warranties and doubtful accounts receivable based upon changes in the business environment resulting from the Companys filing for Chapter 11 including the Companys decision to discontinue certain equipment models and increased collection difficulties. The Company recorded a $5.3 million provision for doubtful accounts receivable, $25.0 million provision for warranty and other liabilities and $38.2 million provision for excess and obsolete inventory. Reorganization Items Reorganization expenses are items of income, expense and loss that were realized or incurred by the Predecessor Company as a result of its decision to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Net reorganization expenses for the Predecessor Company 2001 Eight Months, fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999 consisted of the following: In thousands2001 20001999 Professional fees directly related to the filing $30,639 $ 39,061 $ 14,457 Amortization of debtor in possession financing costs 4,148 10,602 3,125 Accrued retention plan costs2,228 3,603730 Write down of property to be sold 9,000 Settlement of performance guarantees 2,991 Rejected equipment leases 1,399 2,322 Interest earned on DIP proceeds (581) (1,268) (330) $ 36,434$ 65,388$ 20,304 Cash payments made for reorganization items were $34,481, $40,280 and $17,237 for the Predecessor Company 2001 Eight Months, fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999, respectively. Income Taxes Due to the Companys emergence from bankruptcy and the resulting impacts on pre and post emergence operating results for the years covered by this report, an analysis of the overall effective income tax rates for the current and prior years and the major drivers of the tax rates would not be meaningful. The Company currently does not meet the requirements that would allow recording the future benefits of any U.S. net operating loss, tax credits or net deferred tax assets for financial reporting purposes. As a result the Company has recorded valuation reserves to offset any future U.S. income tax benefits, and these valuation reserves will continue to be required until the Company is able to demonstrate that these benefits will be realized through the generation of future U.S. taxable income. See Note 10 Income Taxes for a list of these items and the amount of the associated valuation reserve. Additionally, the Companys plan of reorganization has created a significantly modified capital structure that requires the application of fresh start accounting pursuant to SOP 90 7. Under fresh start accounting, recognition of any deferred tax asset subject to a valuation reserve will require the reduction in valuation reserves to first reduce any excess reorganization value until exhausted, then other intangibles until exhausted and thereafter be reported as additional paid in capital. Consequently, a net tax charge will be incurred in future years when these tax assets are recognized as the reversal of the valuation reserves related to said assets will not be credited against income tax expense. From a cash flow perspective, even though the potential future tax benefits have not been recorded on the balance sheet as of October 31, 2001, the Company has the opportunity to utilize these tax benefits in its U.S. Federal income tax return filing to offset anticipated U.S. taxable income beginning in fiscal 2002 and beyond. However, because the Companys plan of reorganization provided for substantial changes in the Companys ownership, there will be annual limitations on the amount of the U.S. Federal and certain State net operating loss carryforwards which the Company will be able to utilize on its income tax returns. This annual limitation is currently estimated to be approximately $46 million. Discontinued Operations The Predecessor Company classified Beloit Corporation, the Companys former pulp and paper making machinery subsidiary ("Beloit") and its subsidiaries as a discontinued operation in its Consolidated Financial Statements as of October 31, 1999. Most of Beloits assets were sold pursuant to Bankruptcy Court approved procedures prior to the Effective Date. The Predecessor Companys equity interest in Beloit was transferred to a liquidating trust on the Effective Date as provided for in the Amended POR. The Predecessor Company recorded a gain from discontinued operations of $253.2 million for the Predecessor Company 2001 Eight Months. This gain was primarily attributable to the write off of a negative investment in Beloit of approximately $1,063.4 million offset by the write off of Beloit receivables of approximately $809.7 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Working Capital The following table summarizes the major elements of the Companys working capital at the end of the 2001 and 2000 fiscal years: October October In millions 2001 2000 Cash $ 39.7 $ 72.1 Restricted cash 19.4 Accounts receivable 209.5 177.2 Inventories 513.9 410.3 Short term debt (1.7) (108.8) Accounts payable (75.6) (72.5) Other, net (261.9) (259.5) Working Capital $ 443.3 $ 218.8 Working capital as of October 31, 2001 was $443.3 million, or $389.7 million after eliminating $53.6 million of the remaining balance of the write up of inventories associated with fresh start accounting compared with working capital of $218.8 million at the end of fiscal 2000. The remaining $171 million increase in working capital was due to the elimination of $107 million of short term borrowings which was associated with the Companys exit financing as it emerged from Chapter 11, the revaluation of its on hand inventories at the time of emergence which included the elimination of $51.8 million of LIFO inventory reserves, and an increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of the Companys sales near the end of 2001. Cash Flow Cash provided by continuing operations for the Successor Company 2001 Four Months was $62.6 million and combined with the $104.3 million of cash that was used by continuing operations for the Predecessor Company 2001 Eight Months resulted in a Pro forma Combined 2001 $41.7 million use of cash by continuing operations for 2001 compared to $36.7 million of cash provided by continuing operations during fiscal 2000. The $78.4 million additional usage of cash in 2001 was primarily associated with changes in working capital. The two most significant working capital changes related to accounts receivable and inventories. During fiscal 2000 the timing of year end sales resulted in a $14 million reduction in accounts receivable balances while at the end of 2001 the timing of the collection of year end sales resulted in a $37 million increase in outstanding accounts receivable. In addition, inventory reduction programs were effective during 2000 and resulted in a $14 million decrease in inventories during the year, while at the end of 2001 the shipment of a large longwall equipment system slipped into the first quarter of fiscal 2002 and several anticipated electric shovel orders were delayed until 2002 which resulted in a $33.9 million increase in inventories at the end of 2001. Capital expenditures totaled $22.3 million for the Pro forma Combined 2001, $9.6 million for the Successor Company 2001 Four Months and $12.7 million for the Predecessor Company 2001 Eight Months and were $32.4 million during fiscal 2000. For fiscal 2002 the Company anticipates capital expenditures of approximately $30 million primarily for maintenance of existing facilities. Credit Facilities On the Effective Date, obligations relating to the Predecessor Companys debtor in possession financing facility and certain foreign credit facilities were paid in full and the Companys $350 million Credit Agreement dated as of June 29, 2001 with Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown and a group of lenders (the "Credit Agreement") became effective. The Credit Agreement consists of a $250 million revolving loan maturing on October 31, 2005 and a $100 million term loan maturing on April 30, 2005. Substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries are pledged as collateral under the Credit Agreement. Outstanding borrowings bear interest equal to either LIBOR plus the applicable margin (3.25% to 2.25%), or the Base Rate (defined as the higher of the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%) plus the applicable margin (2.25% to 1.25%) at the Companys option depending on certain of its financial ratios. The Company pays a commitment fee ranging from 0.5% to 0.75% on the unused portion of the revolving loan. In addition, Senior Notes were issued under the Senior Notes Indenture between the Company and BNY Midwest Trust Company, as Trustee. Beginning August 9, 2001, approximately $108.8 million of the notes were issued to unsecured creditors of the Companys principal operating subsidiaries, Joy Mining Machinery and P&H Mining Equipment, and their subsidiaries. The Senior Notes are unsecured and are guaranteed by the Companys domestic operating subsidiaries. The principal amount of the Senior Notes is due at maturity on July 10, 2006. Interest is payable semi annually on April 30 and October 31 commencing on October 31, 2001. The interest due on October 31, 2001 was paid in accordance with the terms of the notes. Both the Credit Agreement and Senior Note Indenture contain restrictions and financial covenants relating to, among other things, minimum financial performance and limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens, asset sales, and capital expenditures. The covenants in the Senior Note Indenture are less restrictive than the covenants in the Credit Agreement. Interest coverage, leverage and EBITDA covenants in the Credit Agreement become more restrictive over the term of the agreement. At October 31, 2001, outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement were $163.9 million. In addition, outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement, which count toward the $350 million credit limit, totaled approximately $69.3 million. The interest rate on the $100 million term loan was 6.88% and the weighted average rate on the outstanding balance of the revolver was 6.82% at October 31, 2001. As of October 31, 2001 there was $112 million available for additional borrowings and letters of credit under the Credit Agreement. The available balance is limited to the Companys available borrowing base collateral balance at the end of October. The Company believes that the amounts available under this credit facility combined with cash to be provided from its operations will be sufficient to satisfy the Companys requirements. By amendment dated December 26, 2001, the Credit Agreement was amended and restated to reflect certain debt covenant modifications and clarification of certain definitional and administrative items. The debt covenant amendments included increasing the amount of allowable rent expense the Company may incur on an annual basis from $15 million to $25 million and providing more favorable financial covenants for future measurement periods over the remaining term of the Credit Agreement. The Company incurred $18 million of rent expense for the Successor and Predecessor Combined 2001 period which, absent the amendment and restatement, was in violation of the annual rent expense covenant of the Credit Agreement. Market Risk Volatility in interest rates and foreign exchange rates can impact the Companys earnings, equity and cash flow. From time to time the Company undertakes transactions to hedge this impact. The hedge instrument is considered effective if it offsets partially or completely the negative impact on earnings, equity and cash flow due to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. In accordance with the Companys policy, the Company does not execute derivatives that are speculative or that increase the Companys risk from interest rate or foreign exchange rate fluctuations. At October 31, 2001 the Company was not party to any interest rate derivative contracts. Foreign exchange derivatives at that date were exclusively in the form of forward exchange contracts executed over the counter. The counterparties to these contracts are several commercial banks, all of which hold investment grade ratings, but there is a concentration of these contracts held with The Chase Manhattan Bank. The Company has adopted a Foreign Exchange Risk Management Policy. It is a risk averse policy under which significant exposures that impact earnings and cash flow are fully hedged. Exposures that impact only equity or do not have a cash flow impact are generally not hedged with derivatives. There are two categories of foreign exchange exposures that are hedged: assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and future committed receipts or payments denominated in a foreign currency. These exposures normally arise from imports and exports of goods and from intercompany trade and lending activity. The fair value of the Companys forward exchange contracts at October 31, 2001 is analyzed in the following table of dollar equivalent terms: In thousands Maturing in 2002 BuySell U.S. Dollar 1,355 (295) Australian Dollar (13) German Deutschemark 1 British Pound (447) Euro 48 New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" which addresses the accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated retirement costs. SFAS No. 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. SFAS No. 143 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. The Company does not expect SFAS No. 143 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial condition or cash flows. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". SFAS No. 144 generally establishes a standard framework from which to measure impairment of long lived assets and expands the Accounting Principles Board ("APB") 30, "Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions" to include a component of the entity (rather than a segment of the business). SFAS No. 144 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. The Company does not expect SFAS No. 144 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial condition or cash flows. Item 7A.
