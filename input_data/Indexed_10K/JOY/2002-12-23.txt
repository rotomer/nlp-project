Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations As is more fully discussed in Note 1 Reorganization and Emergence From Chapter 11 and Note 2 Basis of Presentation in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we adopted fresh start accounting pursuant to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 90 7, Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization Under the Bankruptcy Code (SOP 90 7), during the third quarter of Fiscal 2001 resulting in a change in the basis of accounting in our underlying assets and liabilities at the Effective Date. Accordingly, the financial statements of the Successor Company and the Predecessor Company are not comparable. For purposes of this Managements Discussion and Analysis, we have combined the actual results of operations for the Successor Company 2001 Four Months and the Predecessor Company 2001 Eight Months as Fiscal 2001 operating results in order to present a meaningful comparative analysis to current and prior fiscal years operating results. The Successor Company 2001 Four Months and the Predecessor Company 2001 Eight Months financial information are derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition to the basis in accounting differences, operating results of our Fiscal 2001 and Fiscal 2000 were significantly impacted by items associated with the Predecessor Company bankruptcy, including extraordinary debt forgiveness, restructuring activities, pre petition lawsuit settlements and other charges related to certain bankruptcy activities. Also, our Fiscal 2002 and 2001 Four Months were affected by charges relating to recognizing the effects of additional depreciation, amortization and cost of sales arising from the revaluation of our assets at the Effective Date. 2002 Compared with 2001 Sales The following table sets forth the Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001 net sales as derived from our Consolidated Statement of Operations: In thousands Fiscal2002 SuccessorCompany2001 FourMonths PredecessorCompany2001 EightMonths Fiscal2001 Net Sales Underground Mining Machinery $ 745,714 $ 238,548 $ 436,045 $ 674,593 Surface Mining Equipment 405,133 169,167 304,413 473,580 Total $ 1,150,847 $ 407,715 $ 740,458 $ 1,148,173 Net sales in Fiscal 2002 were approximately the same as net sales in Fiscal 2001. A $71.1 million increase in shipments in the Underground Mining Machinery segment was substantially offset by a $68.5 million decrease in net sales for Surface Mining Equipment. The increase in Underground Mining Machinery net sales in Fiscal 2002 was a result of an increase in new machine shipments and replacement parts sales partially offset by a decrease in component repairs. The improved new machine sales were due to higher sales of continuous miners, shuttle cars and roof supports in the United States and continuous miners into China and Australia. Aftermarket shipments in the United States were softer in Fiscal 2002 as compared to Fiscal 2001, particularly in the last two quarters of Fiscal 2002. This decrease was offset by strong parts sales into China. The mild winter and sluggish economy in the United States led to increased coal stockpiles and curtailment of coal production which adversely affected our aftermarket business. The growing population of Joy equipment in operation in China has resulted in higher levels of repair parts sales into that country. The decrease in Surface Mining Equipment net sales in Fiscal 2002 was due to a decrease in the shipment of new equipment, primarily electric mining shovels, while aftermarket parts and service sales remained flat. The decrease in electric mining shovels was due to the depressed market for copper, gold and coal, which resulted in lower new machine sales to North and South American, Australian and Pacific Rim customers. In the aftermarket, increased sales for replacement parts were achieved in North America, Australia and the Pacific Rim. However, these sales were offset by lower parts and service sales in the Southwestern United States and South America. In addition, the sale of refurbished electric mining shovels to customers served by our Australian operation benefited Fiscal 2001. Operating Income The following table sets forth the elements of our Fiscal 2002 operating income (loss) as compared with Fiscal 2001. Actual operating results, as derived from our Consolidated Statement of Operations, have been adjusted to reflect the impacts of fresh start accounting charges, pre petition lawsuit settlements, and restructuring and other special charges: In thousands Fiscal2002 SuccessorCompany2001 FourMonths PredecessorCompany2001 EightMonths Fiscal2001 Operating income (loss): Underground Mining Machinery $ 19,516 $ (28,426) $ 30,269 $ 1,843 Surface Mining Equipment (18,157) (17,738) 23,902 6,164 Corporate Expense (16,502) (6,091) (10,215) (16,306) Total $ (15,143) $ (52,255) $ 43,956 $ (8,299) Adjustments to operating income (loss): Fresh Start Accounting Items $ 80,909 $ 90,978 Pre petition Lawsuit Settlements 975 Predecessor goodwill amortization 6,233 Restructuring and Other Special Charges (58) Total $ 80,909 $ 98,128 Adjusted operating income (loss): Underground Mining Machinery $ 69,280 $ 67,843 Surface Mining Equipment 12,988 38,292 Corporate Expense (16,502) (16,306) Total $ 65,766 $ 89,829 The Fiscal 2002 fresh start accounting items consist of a $53.6 million charge for the increased fair value of inventory that was taken to cost of sales, $13.3 million of additional depreciation expense associated with the revalued property, plant and equipment, and $14.0 million of amortization expense related to the valuation of certain identifiable finite lived intangible assets. The Fiscal 2001 fresh start accounting items consist of a $74.6 million charge for the increased fair value of inventory that was taken to cost of sales, $4.4 million of additional depreciation expense associated with the revalued property, plant and equipment, and $12.0 million of amortization expense related to the valuation of certain identifiable finite lived intangible assets. Also included in the Fiscal 2001 adjustments to operating income was $6.2 million of amortization expense related to goodwill for the 2001 Eight Months. For comparative purposes, Fiscal 2001 operating income has been adjusted to eliminate goodwill amortization because we discontinued amortizing goodwill upon our emergence from bankruptcy in connection with adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The following discussion is based on adjusted operating income (loss) for Fiscal 2002 as compared with Fiscal 2001 as presented in the above table. Operating income decreased from $89.8 million in Fiscal 2001 to $65.8 million in Fiscal 2002. This decrease was the result of a $25.3 million decrease in operating profit for the Surface Mining Equipment business that was partially offset by a $1.4 million increase in operating profit for the Underground Mining Machinery business. Operating profit for Underground Mining Machinery increased slightly in Fiscal 2002 as compared to Fiscal 2001. Favorable impacts included an increase in net sales in Fiscal 2002 and the elimination of the bonus provision due to the failure to meet the performance targets established for the 2002 fiscal year. These favorable impacts on earnings in Fiscal 2002 were partially offset by the unfavorable original equipment sales mix during Fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2002 as compared to Fiscal 2001 included a larger percentage of roof support sales at lower than expected gross margin percentages, unfavorable manufacturing variances associated with the production of several roof support systems and the cost associated with executive management changes. The project management process associated with the fulfillment of roof support orders has been reviewed and the unfavorable performance in Fiscal 2002 is not expected to be repeated. In addition, during Fiscal 2002, the ongoing efforts to control operating costs allowed us to mitigate the impact of general inflation and the cost associated with the implementation of a strategic sourcing initiative, which initiative will benefit product cost in the future. The decrease in operating profit for Surface Mining Equipment was the result of a decrease in net sales in Fiscal 2002, a significant reduction in manufacturing absorption associated with the decrease in the production of new machines in this segments manufacturing facilities, and an increase in warranty costs. In addition, lower production volumes resulted in workforce reduction that increased severance and medical benefit costs at our Milwaukee manufacturing facility during Fiscal 2002. These unfavorable impacts on margins were partially offset by an improvement in the sales mix during Fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2002 as compared to Fiscal 2001 included a larger precentage of parts sales which carry a larger gross margin percentage. Product Development, Selling and Administrative Expense Product development, selling and administrative expense for Fiscal 2002 was $198.8 million, after fresh start charges of $14.0 million, as compared to $209.8 million, after fresh start charges of $12.0 million, for Fiscal 2001. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in bonus accruals and savings due to cost reductions partially offset by an increase in pension expense and charges related to executive severance. After the elimination of fresh start charges, product development, selling and administrative expense as a percentage of sales for Fiscal 2002 decreased to 17.3% as compared to 18.3% in Fiscal 2001. Interest Expense Interest expense for Fiscal 2002 increased to $31.0 million as compared to $25.4 million after eliminating $14.9 million associated with pre petition claims incurred in the Third Quarter of 2001 related to our emergence from bankruptcy, in Fiscal 2001. This increase was principally due to interest expense associated with the Senior Notes, Senior Subordinated Notes and Credit Agreement included in Fiscal 2002 whereas Fiscal 2001 only included less than four months of interest for the Credit Agreement and Senior Notes. Cash interest paid in Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001 was $27.7 million and $21.4 million, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes Income tax benefit for Fiscal 2002 increased to $14.2 million as compared to $13.6 million in Fiscal 2001. This change was principally due to the reversal in Fiscal 2002 of certain deferred tax liabilities related to fresh start accounting adjustments, changes in the sources of earnings around the world and changes in statutory tax rates offset by a $35.0 million tax benefit in the 2001 Third Quarter from the adjustment of certain global income tax liabilities that was not repeated in Fiscal 2002. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Pension expense for Fiscal 2002 was $2.7 million compared to pension income of $5.8 million in Fiscal 2001. This $8.5 million increase in pension expense is the result of the reduction of the discount rate assumption used in the United States for Fiscal 2002 and the reduction in the pension plan assets that have taken place over the past couple years. For the 2003 fiscal year we have reduced the return on asset assumption for the pension plans in the United States and the United Kingdom from 9.5% to 9.0% and 9.5% to 7.5%, respectively. These plans represented in excess of 98% of our total pension plan assets as of the end of Fiscal 2002. These return on asset assumptions are based primarily on the targeted investment asset mix and the expected rate of return on the individual components of the investment mix. As a result of the changes in assumptions and the decrease in the market value of the plan assets, we estimate that pension expense for the 2003 fiscal year will be approximately $13 million. 2001 Compared with 2000 Sales The following table sets forth the Fiscal 2001 and Fiscal 2000 net sales of the Company as derived from the Consolidated Statement of Operations: In thousands SuccessorCompany2001 FourMonths PredecessorCompany2001 EightMonths Fiscal2001 Fiscal2000 Net Sales Underground Mining Machinery $ 238,548 $ 436,045 $ 674,593 $ 614,356 Surface Mining Equipment 169,167 304,413 473,580 508,785 Total $ 407,715 $ 740,458 $ 1,148,173 $ 1,123,141 Net sales in Fiscal 2001 were 2.2% higher than net sales in 2000. A $60.2 million increase in shipments in the Underground Mining Machinery segment was partially offset by a $35.2 million decrease in net sales for Surface Mining Equipment. The increase in Underground Mining Machinery net sales in Fiscal 2001 was a result of a slight improvement in new machine shipments combined with strong performance for replacement parts sales and component repairs. The improved new machine sales were due primarily to the beginning of the recovery from the depressed markets for continuous miners and shuttle cars in the United States and South Africa, while the sales of longwall equipment remained at about the same level as Fiscal 2000. In the aftermarket, favorable results for replacement parts were achieved in the United States where coal producers saw an improvement in the price they received for their coal, and in the Chinese market, served out of the United Kingdom, where the mining equipment that has been placed over the last decade has begun to be rebuilt and to use replacement parts for the rebuilding process. The decrease in Surface Mining Equipment net sales in Fiscal 2001 was due to a decrease in the shipment of new equipment, primarily electric mining shovels, partially offset by an increase in replacement part sales. The decrease in electric mining shovels was due to the depressed market for copper and iron ore, which resulted in lower new machine sales to North and South American customers. In the aftermarket, increased sales for replacement parts were achieved in North and South America as equipment was rebuilt and sales of other equipment suppliers products continued to increase. In addition, the sale of refurbished electric mining shovels to customers served by the Australian operation benefited the 2001 fiscal year. Operating income The following table sets forth the elements of Fiscal 2001 operating income (loss) of the Company as compared with Fiscal 2000. Actual operating results, as derived from the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations, have been adjusted to reflect the impacts of fresh start accounting charges, pre petition lawsuit settlements, and restructing and other special charges: In thousands SuccessorCompany2001 FourMonths PredecessorCompany2001 EightMonths Fiscal2001 Fiscal2000 Operating income (loss): Underground Mining Machinery $ (28,426) $ 30,269 $ 1,843 $ 16,956 Surface Mining Equipment (17,738) 23,902 6,164 57,432 Corporate Expense (6,091) (10,215) (16,306) (16,368) Total $ (52,255) $ 43,956 $ (8,299) $ 58,020 Adjustments to operating income (loss): Fresh Start Accounting Items $ 90,978 $ Predecessor Goodwill Amortization 6,233 9,757 Pre petition Lawsuit Settlements 975 11,365 Restructuring and Other Special Charges (58) 4,518 Total $ 98,128 $ 25,640 Adjusted operating income (loss): Underground Mining Machinery $ 67,843 $ 41,213 Surface Mining Equipment 38,292 58,815 Corporate Expense (16,306) (16,368) Total $ 89,829 $ 83,660 The fresh start accounting charges in Fiscal 2001 consist of a $74.6 million charge for the increase to fair value of inventory that was taken to cost of sales, $4.4 million of additional depreciation expense associated with the revalued property, plant and equipment, and $12.0 million of amortization expense related to the valuation of certain identifiable finite lived intangible assets. Also included in the adjustments to operating income was $6.2 million and $9.8 million of amortization expense related to goodwill for the 2001 Eight Months and Fiscal 2000, respectively. Since goodwill is no longer amortized, this expense is eliminated from operating income for comparative purposes. The following discussion is based on adjusted operating income (loss) for Fiscal 2001 as compared with Fiscal 2000 as presented in the above table. Operating income increased from $83.5 million in Fiscal 2000 to $89.8 million in Fiscal 2001. This improvement was the result of a $26.6 million increase in operating profit for the Underground Mining Machinery business that was largely offset by a $20.3 million decrease in operating profit for the Surface Mining Equipment business. The increase in operating profit for Underground Mining Machinery was due to an increase in net sales, a favorable sales mix that included a larger percentage of replacement parts sales, an increase in manufacturing overhead absorption, and continued benefits of cost reduction programs put in place over the last several years. The improvement in the sales mix, combined with the increase in manufacturing overhead absorption associated with an increase in manufacturing activities in this segments manufacturing facilities resulted in an increase in gorss profit percentage from 23.2% in Fiscal 2000 to 27.8% in Fiscal 2001. Despite a 10% increase in net sales and the impact of general inflation around the world, the Underground Mining Machinery business was able to limit the increase in spending for selling, engineering, and administrative expense to 1.3% in Fiscal 2001 compared to 2000. Operating profit for Surface Mining Equipment decreased from $58.8 million in Fiscal 2000 to $38.3 million in Fiscal 2001. This decrease was the result of the decrease in net sales, lower manufacturing overhead absorption, and a slight increase in administrative expense, all of which were partially offset by an improvement in sales mix to include a larger percentage of parts sales during Fiscal 2001 compared with Fiscal 2000. The benefits of the improvement in the sales mix were more than offset by the decrease in manufacturing overhead absorption associated with the decrease in the production of new machines in this segments manufacturing facilities and resulted in a decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales from 23.3% in Fiscal 2000 to 21.5% in Fiscal 2001. Administrative expense was slightly higher in Fiscal 2001 than in Fiscal 2000 due to initiatives associated with expanding distribution capabilities and a small charge in the fourth quarter of 2001 for headcount reductions which continued into Fiscal 2002. During the third quarter of 2001 the Companys reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code was completed. As a result of emerging from Chapter 11, the 2001 Eight Months includes a number of charges and credits associated with the implementation of the POR and the application of fresh start accounting. The following table provides a summary of these charges and credits and the respective line on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the 2001 Eight Months that were affected: In millions InterestExpense Fresh StartAccounting Income TaxBenefit DebtDischarge DiscontinuedOperations Interest on pre petition claims $ 14.9 $ $ $ $ Reinstated pre petition IRBs 2.5 Inventory revaluation (156.8) Fixed asset revaluation (93.3) Eliminate previous goodwill 310.1 Record value of intangibles (234.4) Record excess reorganization value (22.5) Pension liabilities revaluation 141.9 Postretirement benefits revaluation 8.5 Revised tax liability estimate 1.4 (35.0) Gain on debt discharge (1,124.1) Gain on divestiture of Beloit, net (253.2) Total (income) expense $ 17.4 $ (45.1) $ (35.0) $ (1,124.1) $ (253.2) Future Effects of Fresh Start Accounting The charges reflected in our statement of operations related to the effects of fresh start accounting adjustments are non cash items and, accordingly, do not affect the Companys cash flows from operations. We estimate the effects of fresh start accounting on 2003 operating results will include charges of $13.3 million for depreciation of revalued property, plant and equipment and $8.1 million for amortization of finite lived intangible assets. We estimate that total fresh start accounting charges in 2004 and several years thereafter will approximate $21 million annually. During Fiscal 2002, we reversed certain valuation and other excess tax (see Note 6 Income Taxes). In accordance with the provisions of SOP 90 7, adjustment to the valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets that existed as of the emergence date will first reduce any excess reorganization value until exhausted, then other intangibles until exhausted and thereafter will be reported as additional paid in capital. Intangible assets were allocated on a pro rata share based on their net carrying value at the date of valuation. Also during Fiscal 2002, unpatented technology was reviewed and deemed to have a finite life. This constitutes a change in accounting estimate and therefore, unpatented technology has been reclassified from indefinite lived intangibles to definite lived intangibles and will be amortized over its estimated useful life (see Note 4 Excess Reorganization Value and Other Intangibles). Income Taxes Due to our emergence from bankruptcy and the resulting impacts on pre and post emergence operating results for the years covered by this report, an analysis of the overall effective income tax rates for the current and prior years and the major drivers of the tax rates would not be meaningful. Prior to Fiscal 2002, we determined that we did not meet the requirements that would allow us to record the future benefits of any net operating losses, tax credits or net deferred tax assets for financial reporting purposes. As a result, we recorded valuation reserves to offset all future income tax benefits from these assets on a global basis. During Fiscal 2002, we reviewed this position and, based upon past, current and future operating performance, expectations and available tax strategies we have not provided full valuation allowances for our net deferred tax assets as of November 2, 2002. We have also released all non U.S. deferred tax valuation reserves recorded at the end of Fiscal 2001, except for those of the Australian business segments described above, as we have concluded that the utilization of these assets is more likely than not. As required under the application of fresh start accounting pursuant to SOP 90 7, the release of these reserves was not recorded in the income statement but instead was treated as a reduction of first excess reorganization value and then intangibles. Other than for the foreign valuation reserves referred to above, no other valuation reserves in place at the end of Fiscal 2001 were reversed except for those required to offset assets recorded at the end of Fiscal 2001 that were determined to no longer exist and were thus written off with no resulting income statement impact and approximately $7.1 million related to the projected U.S. taxable income for Fiscal 2002. Under fresh start accounting, recognition of any deferred tax asset subject to a valuation reserve will require the reduction in valuation reserves to first reduce any excess reorganization value until exhausted, then other intangibles until exhausted and thereafter be reported as additional paid in capital. Consequently, a net tax charge will be incurred in future years when these tax assets are utilized. We will continue to monitor the appropriateness of the existing valuation reserves and determine annually the amount of valuation reserves that are required to be maintained. Reorganization Reorganization items Reorganization items include income, expenses and losses that were realized or incurred as a result of the decision to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Net reorganization items for Fiscal 2002, the 2001 Eight Months and Fiscal 2000 consisted of the following: In thousands 2002 2001 2000 Collection of Beloit note $ (7,200) $ $ Other net (382) Professional fees directly related to the filing 352 30,639 39,061 Amortization of debtor in possession financing costs 4,148 10,602 Accrued retention plan costs 2,228 3,603 Interest earned on DIP proceeds (581) (1,268) Write down of property to be sold 9,000 Settlement of performance guarantees 2,991 Rejected equipment leases 1,399 $ (7,230) $ 36,434 $ 65,388 Restructuring and Other Special Charges During 2000, the Company recorded $6.1 million of restructuring charges related to Joys reorganization and rationalization primarily related to employee severance. A prior reserve of $1.6 million was reversed during 2000 as it was no longer needed for facility rationalization. The residual reserve of $1.7 million at October 31, 2000 was utilized prior to the Effective Date. Discontinued Operations The Predecessor Company classified Beloit Corporation, our former pulp and paper making machinery subsidiary (Beloit) and our subsidiaries as a discontinued operation in its Consolidated Financial Statements as of October 31, 1999. Most of Beloits assets were sold pursuant to Bankruptcy Court approved procedures prior to the Effective Date. The Predecessor Companys equity interest in Beloit was transferred to a liquidating trust on the Effective Date as provided for in the POR. The Predecessor Company recorded a gain from discontinued operations of $253.2 million for the 2001 Eight Months. This gain was primarily attributable to the write off of a negative investment in Beloit of approximately $1,063.4 million partially offset by the write off of Beloit receivables of approximately $809.7 million. EBITDA We define EBITDA as income from continuing operations before deducting net interest expense, income taxes, minority interests, depreciation and amortization, and before fresh start and reorganization items. EBITDA is not a substitute for operating income, net income and cash flow from operating activities as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States as a measure of profitability or liquidity. It is presented as additional information because we believe it is a useful indicator of our operating results and our ability to meet debt service requirements. Because all companies do not calculate EBITDA in the same way, our use of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The following table shows our calculation of EBITDA: Fiscal2002 Fiscal2001 Fiscal2000 Underground Mining Machinery Operating Income $ 19,516 $ 1,843 $ 16,956 Depreciation 19,386 15,105 12,732 Amortization 16,817 22,389 16,866 Fresh Start Inventory Adjustment 33,326 48,666 Mediation Settlements 900 11,165 Restructuring Credits (58) 4,518 Underground Mining Machinery EBITDA $ 89,045 $ 88,845 $ 62,237 Surface Mining Equipment Operating Income (Loss) $ (18,157) $ 6,164 $ 57,432 Depreciation 16,913 13,541 12,211 Amortization 5,821 4,770 3,851 Fresh Start Inventory Adjustment 20,234 25,904 Mediation Settlements and other 814 200 Surface Mining Equipment EBITDA $ 24,811 $ 51,193 $ 73,694 Consolidated Operating Income (Loss) $ (15,143) $ (8,299) $ 58,020 Depreciation 36,499 29,212 25,802 Amortization 22,638 27,207 20,788 Fresh Start Inventory Adjustment 53,560 74,570 Mediation Settlements and other 1,714 12,290 Restructuring Credits (58) 4,518 Consolidated EBITDA $ 97,554 $ 124,346 $ 121,418 Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate, on an ongoing basis, our estimates and judgments, including those related to bad debts, excess inventory, warranty, intangible assets, income taxes, and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the accounting policies described below, among others, are the ones that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments, and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results of operations: Revenue Recognition We generally recognize revenue at the time of shipment and passage of title for sales of products and at the time of performance for sales of services. Bill and hold sales, if any, are recognized when they comply with the provisions of the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. We recognize revenue on long term contracts, such as the manufacture of mining shovels, drills, draglines and roof support systems, using the percentage of completion method. Sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion. Sales and gross profit are adjusted prospectively for revisions in estimated total contract costs and contract values. Estimated losses are recognized in full when identified. Based upon experience, provisions for warranty expense are recorded in the period that revenue is recognized. We have life cycle management contracts with customers to supply parts and service from 1 to 13 year terms. These contracts are set up based on the projected costs and revenues of servicing the respective machines over the specified contract terms. The customer is billed monthly and respective deferred revenues recorded based on payments received. Revenue is recognized in the period in which parts are supplied or services provided. Inventories Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market using the first in, first out method of accounting. We evaluate all inventory, including manufacturing raw material, work in process, finished goods, and spare parts, for realizability on a regular basis. Inherent in our estimates of net realizable value are managements estimates related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, possible alternative uses and ultimate realizable value of potentially excess inventory. Intangible Assets Intangible assets include software, drawings, patents, trademarks, unpatented technology and other specifically identifiable intangible assets. We review the carrying value of our intangible assets on an annual basis or more frequently as circumstances warrant. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed in accordance with SFAS No. 142 and valued on a relief from royalty basis using future revenues discounted over the time frame of economic benefit. Intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and valued using undiscounted cash flows. While we believe that our estimates of future revenues and cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions regarding revenues and cash flows could materially affect our evaluations. Accrued Warranties We record accruals for potential warranty claims based on prior claim experience. Warranty costs are accrued at the time revenue is recognized. These warranty costs are based upon managements assessment of past claims and current experience. However, actual claims could be higher or lower than amounts estimated, as the amount and value of warranty claims are subject to variation as a result of many factors that cannot be predicted with certainty. Pension and Postretirement Benefits and Costs We have pension benefits and expenses which are developed from actuarial valuations. These valuations are based on assumptions including, among other things, interest rate fluctuations, discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, retirement ages, and years of service. Future changes affecting the assumptions will change the related pension benefit or expense. Income Taxes We recognize deferred income taxes by applying enacted statutory rates to tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. We provide valuation allowances for deferred tax assets where it is considered more likely than not that we will not realize the benefit of such assets. Liquidity and Capital Resources Working capital and cash flow are two financial measurements which provide an indication of our ability to meet our obligations. We currently use cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facility to fund continuing operations. The following table summarizes the major elements of our working capital at the end of the 2002 and 2001 fiscal years: In millions November 2,2002 October 31,2001 Cash $ 70.9 $ 39.7 Restricted cash 0.3 19.4 Accounts receivable 171.5 209.5 Inventories 418.6 513.9 Other current assets 38.8 16.2 Short term debt (3.0) (1.7) Accounts payable (73.5) (75.6) Employee compensation and benefits (54.5) (40.6) Income taxes payable (32.1) (80.8) Other net (154.3) (156.7) Working Capital $ 382.7 $ 443.3 Working capital as of November 2, 2002 was $382.7 million compared with working capital of $443.3 million, (or $389.7 million after eliminating $53.6 million of the remaining balance of the write up of inventories associated with fresh start accounting) at the end of Fiscal 2001. Our businesses are working capital intensive and require funding for purchases of production and replacement parts inventories and in addition, cash is required for capital expenditures for repair, replacement and upgrading of existing facilities. We have debt service requirements, including semi annual interest payments on our senior subordinated notes as well as interest payments on our credit facility. We believe that cash generated from operations, together with borrowings available under our credit facility, provides us with adequate liquidity to meet our operating and debt service requirements. Cash provided by continuing operations for Fiscal 2002 was $127.5 as compared to $41.7 million used by continuing operations for Fiscal 2001. Approximately $80.5 million was provided from working capital in Fiscal 2002 while approximately $92.6 million was used by working capital in Fiscal 2001. The three most significant working capital changes from Fiscal 2001 to Fiscal 2002 related to accounts receivable, restricted cash and inventories. During Fiscal 2001 the timing of the collection of year end sales resulted in a significant increase in outstanding accounts receivable while at the end of Fiscal 2002 collection efforts resulted in the decrease in outstanding accounts receivable. In addition, inventory reduction programs as well as several Fiscal 2001 anticipated shovel orders which were delayed until Fiscal 2002 contributed to the reduced inventory balance at the end of Fiscal 2002. During Fiscal 2002, we contributed $8.5 million to our worldwide pension plans compared to $3.2 million during Fiscal 2001. As a result of the reduction in the pension plan assets due to poor performance of the global investment markets, we expect to be required to make approximately $20 million of contributions to our various pension plans during the 2003 fiscal year. Beyond fiscal 2003, the investment performance of the plans assets and the actual results of the other actuarial assumptions will drive the funding requirements of the pension plans. Capital expenditures totaled $19.1 million for Fiscal 2002 and $22.3 million for Fiscal 2001. For fiscal 2003, we anticipate capital expenditures between $20 million and $28 million, primarily for maintenance of existing facilities. Credit Facilities On March 18, 2002, we completed the offering of $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due March 15, 2012 in a private placement under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933. We used approximately $100.5 million of the net proceeds of the offering to prepay a term loan previously provided under the credit agreement. Prepayment of the term loan included the payment of accrued interest. The balance of the net proceeds of the Senior Subordinated Notes offering, together with other available funds, was used to redeem our 10.75% Senior Notes due 2006 that were issued on the Effective Date to unsecured creditors of Joy and P&H and their subsidiaries. An extraordinary loss of $4.9 million, net of a tax benefit of $3.2 million, was incurred as a result of the early retirement of debt, consisting of $4.4 million of retirement premiums and the $3.7 million write off of associated debt issuance costs related to the term loan. Our Form S 4 registration statement providing for the exchange of the privately placed notes for registered notes was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 16, 2002. The exchange offering expired on June 19, 2002. On June 25, 2002, we entered into an amended and restated Credit Agreement (Credit Agreement) which consists of a $250 million revolving loan maturing on October 31, 2005. This replaces our prior $250 million revolving credit agreement that also included a $100 million term loan. Substantially all of our assets and our subsidiaries assets are pledged as collateral under the Credit Agreement. Outstanding borrowings bear interest equal to either LIBOR plus the applicable margin (3.25% to 2.25%) or the Base Rate (defined as the higher of the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%) plus the applicable margin (2.25% to 1.25%) at our option depending on certain of our financial ratios. We pay a commitment fee ranging from 0.5% to 0.75% on the unused portion of the revolving loan. Both the Senior Subordinated Note Indenture and Credit Agreement contain restrictions and financial covenants relating to, among other things, minimum financial performance and limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens, asset sales, and capital expenditures. The covenants in the Senior Subordinated Note Indenture are less restrictive than the covenants in the Credit Agreement. Interest coverage, leverage and EBITDA covenants in the Credit Agreement generally become more restrictive over the term of the agreement. By agreement dated October 31, 2002, the Credit Agreement was amended to reflect certain financial covenant modifications and clarification of certain definitional and administrative items. The amendment lowered the financial covenants for the quarter ended November 2, 2002 and for each quarter in fiscal 2003. In addition, the amendment increased the amounts available for restricted junior payments. Absent the amendment, we would have been in violation of one of the financial covenants. At November 2, 2002, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement. Outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement, which count toward the $250 million credit limit, totaled approximately $58.6 million. Accordingly, as of November 2, 2002 there was approximately $107.1 million available for additional borrowings and letters of credits under the Credit Agreement. The available balance is limited to our available borrowing base collateral balance, less $50 million. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We lease various assets under operating leases. The aggregate payments under operating leases as of November 2, 2002 are disclosed in the table of Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments below. No significant changes to lease commitments have occurred since November 2, 2002. We have no other off balance sheet arrangements. Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commerical Commitments The following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commerical commitments as of November 2, 2002: In thousands Total Less than1 year 1 3years 4years 5 years andthereafter Long Term Debt $ 212,600 $ $ $ 8,300 $ 204,300 Short Term Notes Payable 1,865 1,865 Capital Lease Obligations 3,652 1,213 1,371 488 580 Operating Leases 22,517 10,104 9,040 1,930 1,443 Total $ 240,634 $ 13,182 $ 10,411 $ 10,718 $ 206,323 New Accounting Pronouncements In May 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13 and Technical Corrections as of April 2002. A provision of SFAS No. 145 rescinds FASB Statement No. 4, Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt, and an amendment of that Statement. This provision of SFAS No. 145 is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. We do not expect SFAS No. 145 to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity; however, upon adoption of SFAS No. 145, the extraordinary items in prior periods presented resulting from early retirement or discharge of debt will be reclassified. In July 2002, FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. Examples of costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring, discontinued operation, plant closing, or other exit or disposal activity. SFAS No. 146 is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. We do not expect SFAS No. 146 to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market Risk Volatility in interest rates and foreign exchange rates can impact our earnings, equity and cash flow. From time to time we undertake transactions to hedge this impact. Under governing accounting guidelines, the hedge instrument is considered effective if it offsets partially or completely the impact on earnings, equity and cash flow due to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. In accordance with our policy, we do not execute derivatives that are speculative or that increase our risk from interest rate or foreign exchange rate fluctuations. At November 2, 2002 we were not party to any interest rate derivative contracts. Foreign exchange derivatives at that date were exclusively in the form of forward exchange contracts executed over the counter. There is a concentration of these contracts held with LaSalle Bank, N.A. as agent for ABN Amro Bank, N.V. which maintains an investment grade rating. We have adopted a Foreign Exchange Risk Management Policy. It is a risk averse policy under which significant exposures that impact earnings and cash flow are fully hedged. Exposures that impact only equity or do not have a cash flow impact are generally not hedged with derivatives. There are two categories of foreign exchange exposures that are hedged: assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and future committed receipts or payments denominated in a foreign currency. These exposures normally arise from imports and exports of goods and from intercompany trade and lending activity. The fair value of our forward exchange contracts at November 2, 2002 is analyzed in the following table of dollar equivalent terms: In thousands of US Dollars Maturing in 2003 Buy Sell U.S. Dollar (225) 91 Australian Dollar 176 British Pound 67 Euro (20)
