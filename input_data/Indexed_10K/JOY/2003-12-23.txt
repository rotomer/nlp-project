Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations As is more fully discussed in Note 1 Reorganization and Emergence From Chapter 11 and Note 2 Basis of Presentation in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we adopted fresh start accounting pursuant to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 90 7, "Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization Under the Bankruptcy Code" ("SOP 90 7"), during the third quarter of Fiscal 2001 resulting in a change in the basis of accounting in our underlying assets and liabilities at the Effective Date. Accordingly, the financial statements of the Successor Company and the Predecessor Company are not comparable. For purposes of this Managements Discussion and Analysis, we have combined the actual results of operations for the Successor Company 2001 Four Months and the Predecessor Company 2001 Eight Months as Fiscal 2001 operating results in order to present a meaningful comparative analysis to current and prior fiscal years operating results. The Successor Company 2001 Four Months and the Predecessor Company 2001 Eight Months financial information are derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition to the basis in accounting differences, operating results of our Fiscal 2001 were significantly impacted by items associated with the Predecessor Company bankruptcy, including extraordinary debt forgiveness, restructuring activities, pre petition lawsuit settlements and other charges related to certain bankruptcy activities. Also, our Fiscal 2003, Fiscal 2002 and 2001 Four Months were affected by charges relating to recognizing the effects of additional depreciation, amortization and cost of sales arising from the revaluation of our assets at the Effective Date. 2003 Compared with 2002 Sales The following table sets forth Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002 net sales as derived from our Consolidated Statement of Operations: In thousands Fiscal 2003 Fiscal 2002 Net Sales Underground Mining Machinery $ 685,999 $ 745,714 Surface Mining Equipment 529,967 405,133 Total $ 1,215,966 $ 1,150,847 The decrease in Underground Mining Machinery net sales in Fiscal 2003 was a result of lower new machine shipments and replacement parts sales partially offset by an increase in component repairs and complete machine rebuilds. The decrease in new machine sales was due to lower sales of continuous miners, shuttle cars and roof supports in the United States, lower sales of shuttle cars in South Africa, and lower sales of roof supports in the United Kingdom. New machine shipments increased in Australia due to roof support shipments and the shipment of several continuous miners specifically designed for the Australian market. Aftermarket shipments for repair parts in the United States, United Kingdom and the emerging markets served out of the United Kingdom were softer in Fiscal 2003 as compared to Fiscal 2002. Although aftermarket sales in the emerging markets served out of the United Kingdom in Fiscal 2003 did not match the record levels of Fiscal 2002, aftermarket parts shipments into these markets remained strong, despite a temporary interruption of orders due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in China. Aftermarket product shipments in South Africa were strong, principally due to maintenance and life cycle programs to support current equipment and the favorable impact of translating South African Rand sales into U.S. dollars. Mild summer and winter weather during Fiscal 2003 and the delay of the economic recovery in the United States adversely affected Joys new machine and aftermarket businesses. The increase in Surface Mining Equipment net sales in Fiscal 2003 was a result of an increase in new equipment shipments, aftermarket parts and service sales. The increase in new equipment was due to higher sales of electric mining shovels in both South America and Canada. The increase in South American shovel sales was provided by a stronger demand in the copper market. The increase in Canadian shovel sales was attributed to activity in the oil sands. In the aftermarket, sales of replacement parts increased in North and South America, Southern Africa, China and India. Service sales were strong in Australia, which included erection of a dragline, and in South America. Operating Income The following table sets forth Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002 operating income as derived from our Consolidated Statement of Operations: In thousands Fiscal 2003 Fiscal 2002 Operating income (loss): Underground Mining Machinery $ 43,573 $ 19,516 Surface Mining Equipment 27,572 (18,157) Corporate Expense (23,463) (16,502) Total $ 47,682 $ (15,143) Operating income for Underground Mining Machinery increased by approximately $24.1 million in Fiscal 2003 as compared to Fiscal 2002. Charges for the depreciation and amortization of the fresh start accounting items decreased by approximately $37.8 million. Excluding the impact of the charges for fresh start, the decrease in operating income for Fiscal 2003 was $13.8 million. This decrease included a $5.1 million charge associated with manufacturing capacity rationalization in the United States and restructuring in the United Kingdom and Australia. Operating income was negatively impacted by unfavorable manufacturing absorption associated with the decrease in production of new machines and an increase in both compensation expense associated with performance based incentive programs and pension expense in the United States and the United Kingdom. Operating income was positively effected by the elimination of unfavorable manufacturing variances associated with the manufacture of roof supports in Fiscal 2002, the favorable impact of our strategic sourcing initiative, and warranty expense improvements through our quality initiative. Operating income for Surface Mining Equipment increased by approximately $45.7 million in Fiscal 2003 as compared to Fiscal 2002. During Fiscal 2003, charges for the depreciation and amortization of the fresh start accounting items decreased by approximately $21.8 million. Excluding the impact of the charges for fresh start, the increase in operating income for Fiscal 2003 was $23.9 million. The increase in operating income for Surface Mining Equipment was the result of an increase in net sales in Fiscal 2003 and a significant increase in manufacturing absorption associated with the higher volume of production of new machines in this segments manufacturing facilities. Lower production volumes in Fiscal 2002 resulted in workforce reduction that increased severance and medical benefit costs at our Milwaukee manufacturing facility that was not repeated during Fiscal 2003. These favorable impacts on margins were partially offset by the sales mix, which included a sale of a dragline in Australia, and by compensation expenses associated with performance based incentive programs. The increase in the corporate expense was primarily attributed to compensation expense associated with performance based incentive programs. Product Development, Selling and Administrative Expense Product development, selling and administrative expense for Fiscal 2003 was $241.5 million, after fresh start charges of $9.0 million, as compared to $212.8 million, after fresh start charges of $14.0 million, for Fiscal 2002. The increase in product development, selling and administrative expense was due primarily to an increase in pension expense, medical costs, general insurance costs and compensation expense associated with performance based incentive programs and the impact associated with the translation of non U.S. expenses into U.S. dollars due to exchange rate fluctuations. These increases were partially offset by cost reductions associated with our strategic sourcing initiative. Product development, selling and administrative expense as a percentage of sales for Fiscal 2003 increased to 19.9% as compared to 18.5% in Fiscal 2002. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Pension expense for Fiscal 2003 was $14.2 million compared to pension expense of $2.7 million in Fiscal 2002. The increase in pension expense is the result of a reduction in the expected rate of return on plan assets assumption and a decrease in market value of plan assets from the beginning of the year. For Fiscal 2003 we reduced the return on asset assumption for the pension plans in the United States and the United Kingdom from 9.5% to 9.0% and 9.5% to 7.5%, respectively. These plans represented in excess of 98% of our total pension plan assets as of the end of Fiscal 2003. These rate of return on assets assumptions are based primarily on the targeted investment asset mix and the expected rates of return on the individual components of the investment mix. Interest Expense Interest expense for Fiscal 2003 decreased to $27.0 million as compared to $31.0 for Fiscal 2002. This decrease was principally due to our repayment of a term loan in Fiscal 2002 and reduced borrowings under our revolving credit agreement. There were no borrowings under our revolving credit agreement in Fiscal 2003. Cash interest paid in Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002 were $23.1 million and $27.7 million, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes The consolidated effective income tax rates for Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002 are approximately 34% and 40%, respectively. Consolidated income tax expense increased to $9.4 million in Fiscal 2003 as compared to a benefit of $17.5 million in Fiscal 2002. The increase in income tax expense is primarily attributed to the income earned in Fiscal 2003 as compared to the loss incurred in Fiscal 2002. The principal driver differentiating the tax rate between the two years is changes in the global mix of earnings in jurisdictions whose effective tax rates are lower than the U.S. statutory rate offset in Fiscal 2003 partially by the provision of taxes against certain accumulated earnings of our South African affiliate. 2002 Compared with 2001 Sales The following table sets forth Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001 net sales as derived from our Consolidated Statement of Operations: In thousands Fiscal 2002 Successor Company 2001 Four Months Predecessor Company 2001 Eight Months Fiscal 2001 Net Sales Underground Mining Machinery $ 745,714 $ 238,548 $ 436,045 $ 674,593 Surface Mining Equipment 405,133 169,167 304,413 473,580 Total $ 1,150,847 $ 407,715 $ 740,458 $ 1,148,173 Net sales in Fiscal 2002 were approximately the same as net sales in Fiscal 2001. A $71.1 million increase in shipments in the Underground Mining Machinery segment was substantially offset by a $68.5 million decrease in net sales for Surface Mining Equipment. The increase in Underground Mining Machinery net sales in Fiscal 2002 was a result of an increase in new machine shipments and replacement parts sales partially offset by a decrease in component repairs. The improved new machine sales were due to higher sales of continuous miners, shuttle cars and roof supports in the United States and continuous miners into China and Australia. Aftermarket shipments in the United States were softer in Fiscal 2002 as compared to Fiscal 2001, particularly in the last two quarters of Fiscal 2002. This decrease was offset by strong parts sales into China. The mild winter and sluggish economy in the United States led to increased coal stockpiles and curtailment of coal production which adversely affected Joys aftermarket business. The growing population of Joy equipment in operation in China resulted in higher levels of repair parts sales into that country. The decrease in Surface Mining Equipment net sales in Fiscal 2002 was due to a decrease in the shipment of new equipment, primarily electric mining shovels, while aftermarket parts and service sales remained flat. The decrease in electric mining shovels sales was due to the depressed market for copper, gold and coal, which resulted in lower new machine sales to North and South American, Australian and Pacific Rim customers. In the aftermarket, replacement parts sales increased in North America, Australia and the Pacific Rim. However, these sales were offset by lower parts and service sales in the Southwestern United States and South America. In addition, Fiscal 2001 benefited from sales of refurbished electric mining shovels to customers served by our Australian operation. Operating Income The following table sets forth Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001 operating income as derived from our Consolidated Statement of Operations: In thousands Fiscal 2002 Successor Company 2001 Four Months Predecessor Company 2001 Eight Months Fiscal 2001 Operating income (loss): Underground Mining Machinery $ 19,516 $ (28,426) $ 30,269 $ 1,843 Surface Mining Equipment (18,157) (17,738) 23,902 6,164 Corporate Expense (16,502) (6,091) (10,215) (16,306) Total $ (15,143) $ (52,255) $ 43,956 $ (8,299) The Fiscal 2002 operating income includes fresh start accounting items consisting of a $53.6 million charge for the increased fair value of inventory that was taken to cost of sales, $13.3 million of additional depreciation expense associated with the revalued property, plant and equipment, and $14.0 million of amortization expense related to the valuation of certain identifiable finite lived intangible assets. The Fiscal 2001 operating income includes fresh start accounting items consisting of a $74.6 million charge for the increased fair value of inventory that was taken to cost of sales, $4.4 million of additional depreciation expense associated with the revalued property, plant and equipment, and $12.0 million of amortization expense related to the valuation of certain identifiable finite lived intangible assets. Also included in Fiscal 2001 operating income was $6.2 million of amortization expense related to goodwill for the 2001 Eight Months and $1.0 million of settlements of pre petition lawsuits. Operating income, after consideration of the items listed in the preceding paragraph, decreased from $89.8 million in Fiscal 2001 to $65.8 million in Fiscal 2002. This decrease was the result of a $25.3 million decrease in operating profit for the Surface Mining Equipment business that was partially offset by a $1.4 million increase in operating profit for the Underground Mining Machinery business. Operating income for Underground Mining Machinery increased in Fiscal 2002 as compared to Fiscal 2001. Favorable impacts included an increase in net sales in Fiscal 2002 and the elimination of the bonus provision due to the failure to meet the performance targets established for Fiscal 2002. These favorable impacts on earnings in Fiscal 2002 were partially offset by the unfavorable original equipment sales mix during Fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2002 as compared to Fiscal 2001 included a larger percentage of roof support sales at lower than expected gross margin percentages, unfavorable manufacturing variances associated with the production of several roof support systems, and costs associated with executive management changes. The decrease in operating profit for Surface Mining Equipment was the result of a decrease in net sales in Fiscal 2002, a significant reduction in manufacturing absorption associated with the decrease in the production of new machines in this segments manufacturing facilities, and an increase in warranty costs. In addition, lower production volumes resulted in workforce reduction that increased severance and medical benefit costs at our Milwaukee manufacturing facility during Fiscal 2002. These unfavorable impacts on margins were partially offset by an improvement in the sales mix during Fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2002 as compared to Fiscal 2001 included a larger percentage of parts sales which carry a higher gross margin percentage. Product Development, Selling and Administrative Expense Product development, selling and administrative expense for Fiscal 2002 was $198.8 million, after fresh start charges of $14.0 million, as compared to $209.8 million, after fresh start charges of $12.0 million, for Fiscal 2001. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in bonus accruals and savings due to cost reductions partially offset by an increase in pension expense and charges related to executive severance. After the elimination of fresh start charges, product development, selling and administrative expense as a percentage of sales for Fiscal 2002 decreased to 17.3% as compared to 18.3% in Fiscal 2001. Interest Expense Interest expense for Fiscal 2002 increased to $31.0 million as compared to $25.4 million after eliminating $14.9 million associated with pre petition claims incurred in the Third Quarter of 2001 related to our emergence from bankruptcy, in Fiscal 2001. This increase was principally due to interest expense associated with the senior notes, senior subordinated notes and Credit Agreement included in Fiscal 2002 whereas Fiscal 2001 only included less than four months of interest for the Credit Agreement and senior notes. Cash interest paid in Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001 was $27.7 million and $21.4 million, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes Income tax benefit for Fiscal 2002 decreased to $9.4 million as compared to $13.6 million in Fiscal 2001. This change was principally due to the reversal in Fiscal 2002 of certain deferred tax liabilities related to fresh start accounting adjustments, changes in the sources of earnings around the world and changes in statutory tax rates, offset by a $35.0 million tax benefit in Fiscal 2001 from the adjustment of certain global income tax liabilities that was not repeated in Fiscal 2002. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Pension expense for Fiscal 2002 was $2.7 million compared to pension income of $5.8 million in Fiscal 2001. This $8.5 million increase in pension expense is the result of the reduction of the discount rate assumption used in the United States for Fiscal 2002 and a reduction in the market value of pension plan assets. Future Effects of Fresh Start Accounting The charges reflected in our statement of operations related to the effects of fresh start accounting adjustments are non cash items and, accordingly, do not affect our cash flows from operations. We estimate the effects of fresh start accounting on fiscal 2004 operating results will include charges of $13.2 million for depreciation of revalued property, plant and equipment and $2.8 million for amortization of finite lived intangible assets. We estimate that total fresh start accounting charges in fiscal 2004 and several years thereafter will approximate $16.0 million annually. During Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002, we reversed certain valuation allowances and other excess tax reserves (see Note 7 Income Taxes). In accordance with the provisions of SOP 90 7, adjustments to the valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets that existed as of the emergence date will first reduce any excess reorganization value until exhausted, then other intangibles until exhausted, and thereafter will be reported as additional paid in capital. Intangible assets were allocated on a pro rata share based on their net carrying value at the date of valuation. Also during Fiscal 2002, unpatented technology was reviewed and deemed to have a finite life. This constituted a change in accounting estimate and therefore, unpatented technology has been reclassified from indefinite lived intangibles to definite lived intangibles and is being amortized over its estimated useful life (see Note 5Excess Reorganization Value and Other Intangibles).. Income Taxes Deferred taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using statutory tax rates. Deferred income tax provisions are based on changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities from period to period, adjusted for certain reclassifications under fresh start accounting. In addition, we analyze our ability to recognize currently the net deferred tax assets created in each jurisdiction in which we operate to determine if valuation allowances are necessary because realizability of the tax assets is deemed to not be more likely than not. Prior to Fiscal 2002, we determined that we did not meet the requirements that would allow us to record the future benefits of any net operating losses, tax credits or net deferred tax assets for financial reporting purposes due to our emergence from bankruptcy in Fiscal 2001. As a result, we recorded valuation reserves to offset all future income tax benefits from these assets on a global basis for both pre and post emergence balances. During Fiscal 2002, we reviewed this position and, based upon past, current and future operating performance, expectations and available tax strategies, did not provide full valuation allowances for new net deferred tax assets as of November 2, 2002. Additionally, we released all non U.S. deferred tax valuation reserves recorded at the end of Fiscal 2001 in Fiscal 2002 (except for those of certain Australian business segments as we concluded that the utilization of these assets is not more likely than not) and a portion of the reserves recorded against the net U.S. asset based upon projected future net operating loss utilization. For Fiscal 2003, we performed a similar realization analysis for all deferred tax assets and again did not provide full valuation allowances for new net deferred tax assets created as of November 1, 2003. Additional amounts of valuation reserves related to U.S. and Australian net operating loss carryforwards were released based upon a tax restructuring in Australia and projected future net operating loss utilization. As required under the application of fresh start accounting, the release of pre emergence tax valuation reserves was not recorded in the income statement but instead was treated first as a reduction of excess reorganization value until exhausted, then intangibles until exhausted, and thereafter reported as additional paid in capital. Consequently, a net tax charge will be incurred in future years when these tax assets are utilized. We will continue to monitor the appropriateness of the existing valuation allowances and determine annually the amount of valuation allowances that are required to be maintained. We estimate the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year during the course of the year on an interim basis. The estimated effective tax rate contemplates the expected jurisdiction where income is earned (e.g. United States compared to non United States) as well as tax planning strategies. If the actual results are different from these estimates, adjustments to the effective tax rate may be required in the period such determination is made. Reorganization Items Reorganization items include income, expenses and losses that were realized or incurred as a result of the decision to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Net reorganization items for Fiscal 2003, Fiscal 2002 and the 2001 Eight Months consisted of the following: In thousands (income) expense Fiscal 2003 Fiscal 2002 2001Eight Months Beloit U.K. claim settlement $ (3,333 ) $ $ Collection of Beloit note (7,200 ) Other net (573 ) (382 ) Professional fees directly related to the filing 1,495 352 30,639 Amortization of debtor in possession financing costs 4,148 Accrued retention plan costs 2,228 Interest earned on DIP proceeds (581 ) $ (2,411 ) $ (7,230 ) $ 36,434 Restructuring and Other Special Charges Costs associated with restructuring activities other than those activities covered by SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, or that involve an entity newly acquired in a business combination, are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. Accordingly, costs associated with such activities are recorded as restructuring costs in the consolidated statements of operations when the liability is incurred. Below is a summary of the activity related to restructuring costs recorded pursuant to SFAS No. 146 for the twelve months ended November 1, 2003. In thousands One time Termination Benefits Abandoned Assets Other Associated Costs Total Charges Twelve Months ended November 1, 2003 P&H Mining Equipment $ $ 1,154 $ 612 $ 1,766 Joy Mining Machinery 3,384 715 1,050 5,149 $ 3,384 $ 1,869 $ 1,662 $ 6,915 During Fiscal 2003, we began implementing a manufacturing capacity rationalization at our P&H Mining Equipment Milwaukee location. A reduction of factory space by 350,000 square feet resulted in a facility that is more efficient yet still capable of producing the entire worlds expected needs for the P&H range of surface mining products. The rationalization should be completed in fiscal 2004 and is expected to result in savings greater than the cash costs to implement. The expected costs are estimated at $2.8 million. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, approximately $1.2 million of restructuring charges were incurred for property, plant and equipment determined to be either held for sale or disposed of other than by sale in Fiscal 2003. In addition, in accordance with SFAS No. 146, approximately $0.6 million were incurred in Fiscal 2003 for costs to close and consolidate the facility. During Fiscal 2003, Joy Mining Machinery began implementing a manufacturing capacity rationalization plan for North America. Total costs for the Joy North American manufacturing capacity rationalization are estimated at $3.9 million. Included in this amount is $2.3 million for one time termination benefits for an estimated 132 employees, including salaried and non salaried employees, $0.7 million for abandoned assets, and $0.9 million for other associated costs. Also during Fiscal 2003, Joy Mining Machinery began implementing a manufacturing capacity rationalization plan for the United Kingdom and Australia. The total costs for the United Kingdom manufacturing capacity rationalization are estimated at $1.6 million, almost entirely for one time termination benefits for 26 employees. The total costs for the Australian manufacturing capacity rationalization are estimated at $0.2 million, almost entirely for one time termination benefits for 27 employees. As of November 1, 2003, Joy had recorded restructuring charges under these programs of $3.4 million for termination benefits related to the involuntary termination of 185 employees, charges of $0.7 million for the abandonment of excess warehousing equipment at its Franklin, Pennsylvania facility, and $1.1 million for equipment relocation costs. Discontinued Operations The Predecessor Company classified Beloit Corporation, our former pulp and paper making machinery subsidiary (Beloit) and its subsidiaries as a discontinued operation in our Consolidated Financial Statements as of October 31, 1999. Most of Beloits assets were sold pursuant to Bankruptcy Court approved procedures prior to the Effective Date. The Predecessor Companys equity interest in Beloit was transferred to a liquidating trust on the Effective Date as provided for in the POR. The Predecessor Company recorded a gain from discontinued operations of $253.2 million for the 2001 Eight Months. This gain was primarily attributable to the write off of a negative investment in Beloit of approximately $1,063.4 million partially offset by the write off of Beloit receivables of approximately $809.7 million. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to bad debts, excess inventory, warranty, intangible assets, income taxes and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the accounting policies described below are the ones that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments, and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results of operations: Revenue Recognition We generally recognize revenue at the time of shipment and passage of title for sales of products and at the time of performance for sales of services. We recognize revenue on long term contracts, such as the manufacture of mining shovels, drills, draglines and roof support systems, using either the percentage of completion or completed contract methods. When using the percentage of completion method, sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion. Sales and gross profit are adjusted prospectively for revisions in estimated total contract costs and contract values. Estimated losses are recognized in full when identified. Provisions for warranty expense are based upon experience and recorded in the period that the related revenue is recognized. We have life cycle management contracts with customers to supply parts and service for terms of 1 to 13 years. These contracts are set up based on the projected costs and revenues of servicing the respective machines over the specified contract terms. Customers are generally billed monthly and the respective deferred revenues are recorded based on payments received. Revenue is recognized in the period in which parts are supplied or services provided. Revenue recognition involves judgments, assessments of expected returns, the likelihood of nonpayment, and estimates of expected costs and profits on long term contracts. We analyze various factors, including a review of specific transactions, historical experience, credit worthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions, in determining when to recognize revenue. Changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized with a resulting impact on the timing and amount of associated income. Inventories Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market using the first in, first out method of accounting. We evaluate all inventory, including manufacturing raw material, work in process, finished goods, and spare parts, for realizability on a regular basis. Inherent in our estimates of net realizable value are estimates related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, possible alternative uses and ultimate realizable value of potentially excess inventory. We fully reserve for inventory identified as obsolete inventory. Intangible Assets Intangible assets include software, drawings, patents, trademarks, unpatented technology and other specifically identifiable intangible assets. We review the carrying value of our intangible assets on an annual basis or more frequently as circumstances warrant. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and valued on a relief from royalty basis using future revenues discounted over the time frame of economic benefit. Intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets and valued using undiscounted cash flows. While we believe that our estimates of future revenues and cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions regarding revenues and cash flows could materially affect our evaluations. Accrued Warranties We record accruals for potential warranty claims based on prior claim experience. Warranty costs are accrued at the time revenue is recognized. These warranty costs are based upon managements assessment of past claims and current experience. However, actual claims could be higher or lower than amounts estimated, as the amount and value of warranty claims are subject to variation as a result of many factors that cannot be predicted with certainty. Pension and Postretirement Benefits and Costs We have pension benefits and expenses which are developed from actuarial valuations. These valuations are based on assumptions including, among other things, interest rate fluctuations, discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, retirement ages, and years of service. Future changes affecting the assumptions will change the related pension benefit or expense. Income Taxes We recognize deferred income taxes by applying statutory rates to tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. We provide valuation allowances for deferred tax assets where it is considered more likely than not that we will not realize the benefit of such assets. Liquidity and Capital Resources Working capital and cash flow are two financial measurements which provide an indication of our ability to meet our financial obligations. We currently use cash generated by operations to fund continuing operations. The following table summarizes the major elements of our working capital at the end of the 2003 and 2002 fiscal years: In millions November 1, 2003 November 2, 2002 Cash and cash equivalents $ 148 .5 $ 70 .9 Restricted cash 0 .3 Accounts receivable 193 .9 171 .5 Inventories 382 .9 418 .6 Other current assets 51 .3 38 .8 Short term debt (4 .8) (3 .0) Accounts payable (89 .1) (73 .5) Employee compensation and benefits (57 .7) (54 .5) Income taxes payable (26 .1) (32 .1) Other current liabilities (148 .0) (154 .3) Working Capital $ 450 .9 $ 382 .7 Our businesses are working capital intensive and require funding for purchases of production and replacement parts inventories. In addition, cash is required for capital expenditures for the repair, replacement and upgrading of existing facilities. We have debt service requirements, including semi annual interest payments on our senior subordinated notes as well as commitment and letter of credit fees under our revolving credit facility. We believe that cash generated from operations, together with borrowings available under our credit facility, provides us with adequate liquidity to meet our operating and debt service requirements. Cash provided by operations for Fiscal 2003 was $105.6 million as compared to $127.5 million provided by operations for Fiscal 2002. Approximately $39.9 million was provided from working capital in Fiscal 2003 while approximately $80.5 million was provided from working capital in Fiscal 2002. The most significant working capital change affecting the usage of cash from Fiscal 2002 to Fiscal 2003 related to accounts receivable. During Fiscal 2003 the timing of year end sales resulted in a significant increase in outstanding accounts receivable while at the end of Fiscal 2002 collection efforts resulted in the decrease in outstanding accounts receivable. The most significant working capital changes providing an increase of cash from Fiscal 2002 to Fiscal 2003 related to inventories and trade accounts payable. Inventory reduction programs and the timing of cash payments to outside vendors contributed to the reduced inventory balance and increased trade accounts payable balance at the end of Fiscal 2003. During Fiscal 2003, we contributed $53.8 million to our worldwide pension plans compared to $8.5 million during Fiscal 2002. As a result of the additional contributions in Fiscal 2003, we do not expect additional contributions for U.S. plans but expect approximately $5.0 million of contributions for non U.S. plans in fiscal 2004. Beyond fiscal 2004, the investment performance of the plans assets and the actual results of the other actuarial assumptions will determine the funding requirements of the pension plans. Cash used by investment activities for Fiscal 2003 was $30.5 million as compared to $11.6 million used by investment activities for Fiscal 2002. Approximately $27.5 million and $19.1 million were used for capital expenditures in Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002, respectively. For fiscal 2004, we anticipate capital expenditures between $20 million and $28 million, primarily for maintenance of existing facilities. In addition, approximately $12.3 million was used in Fiscal 2003 to acquire the 25% interest in our Australian surface mining equipment subsidiary held by Kobelco Construction Machinery Co. Limited. This acquisition will enable us to utilize our net operating losses in Australia and reduce our cash taxes. Cash used by financing activities for Fiscal 2003 was $10.0 million as compared to $85.7 million used by financing activities for Fiscal 2002. This use in Fiscal 2003 was principally to retire $8.3 million and $4.3 million (gross principal amounts) of 8.5% and 8.75%, respectively, industrial revenue bonds. Credit Facilities In Fiscal 2002, we completed the offering of $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due March 15, 2012 in a private placement under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933. We used approximately $100.5 million of the net proceeds of the offering to prepay a term loan previously provided under the credit agreement. The balance of the net proceeds of the Senior Subordinated Notes offering, together with other available funds, was used to redeem our 10.75% Senior Notes due 2006 that were issued on the Effective Date to unsecured creditors of Joy and P&H and their subsidiaries. A loss of $8.1 million was incurred as a result of the early retirement of debt, consisting of $4.4 million of retirement premiums and the $3.7 million write off of associated debt issuance costs related to the term loan. The privately placed notes were exchanged for registered notes during Fiscal 2002. On June 25, 2002, we entered into an amended and restated Credit Agreement (Credit Agreement) which consists of a $250 million revolving loan maturing on October 31, 2005. The Credit Agreement replaced our prior $250 million revolving credit agreement that also included a $100 million term loan. Substantially all of our assets and our subsidiaries assets are pledged as collateral under the Credit Agreement. Outstanding borrowings bear interest equal to either LIBOR plus the applicable margin (3.25% to 2.25%) or the Base Rate (defined as the higher of the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%) plus the applicable margin (2.25% to 1.25%) at our option depending on certain of our financial ratios. We pay a commitment fee ranging from 0.5% to 0.75% on the unused portion of the revolving loan. Both the Senior Subordinated Note Indenture and Credit Agreement contain restrictions and financial covenants relating to, among other things, minimum financial performance and limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens, asset sales, capital expenditures, dividends and stock repurchases. The covenants in the Senior Subordinated Note Indenture are generally less restrictive than the covenants in the Credit Agreement. Interest coverage, leverage and EBITDA covenants in the Credit Agreement generally become more restrictive over the term of the agreement. In general, the Indenture limits the aggregate amount of dividends and stock repurchases since March 2002 to the greater of $25 million or the sum of 50% of Consolidated Net Income (as defined in the Indenture) since March 2002 and 100% of the proceeds of any stock sales since March 2002. Under the Credit Agreement, the aggregate amount of dividends and stock repurchases that can be made in any fiscal year is generally limited to the lesser of $10 million or 50% of Consolidated Net Income (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the immediately preceding fiscal year. By agreement dated October 31, 2002, the Credit Agreement was amended to reflect certain financial covenant modifications and clarification of certain definitional and administrative items. The amendment lowered the financial covenants for the quarter ended November 2, 2002 and for each quarter in fiscal 2003. In addition, the amendment increased the amounts available for restricted junior payments. Absent the amendment, we would have been in violation of one of the financial covenants at November 2, 2002. At November 1, 2003, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement. Outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement, which count toward the $250 million credit limit, totaled approximately $63.7 million. The balance available for direct borrowings and issuance of letters of credit is a function of a monthly borrowing base calculation as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Accordingly, as of November 1, 2003 there was approximately $140.1 million available for additional borrowings and letters of credits under the Credit Agreement. OffBalance Sheet Arrangements We lease various assets under operating leases. The aggregate payments under operating leases as of November 1, 2003 are disclosed in the table of Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments below. No significant changes to lease commitments have occurred since November 1, 2003. We have no other off balance sheet arrangements.

FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of the guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. This interpretation does not prescribe a specific approach for subsequently measuring the guarantors recognized liability over the term of the related guaranty. This interpretation also supersedes and incorporates the guidance in FASB Interpretation No. 34, Disclosure of Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of FIN 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements of FIN 45, including those related to product warranties, are effective for financial statements for interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. We adopted FIN 45 in the first quarter of Fiscal 2003. Adoption of this interpretation did not have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position (See Note 10 Warranties). In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on Issue No. 00 21, Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements (EITF 00 21). EITF 00 21 addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities. It also addresses when and how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting. The guidance in EITF 00 21 is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003, with early application permitted. Companies may elect to report the change in accounting as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with APB Opinion 20, Accounting Changes and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements (an amendment of APB Opinion No. 28). We adopted the provisions of EITF 00 21 during Fiscal 2003. Adoption of this interpretation did not have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. In December 2002, FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and APB Opinion No. 28, Interim Financial Reporting. The transition provisions of SFAS No. 148 are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002, and the disclosure requirements are effective for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002. The adoption of SFAS No. 148 did not have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position as we have elected to continue to follow APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related interpretations. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which requires the consolidation of certain special purpose or variable interest entities. FIN 46 is applicable to financial statements issued after June 15, 2003. Adoption of this interpretation did not have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities under FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. Adoption of this interpretation did not have a significant effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial position. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for classifying and measuring certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS No. 150 was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after August 21, 2003 and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. SFAS No. 150 will be implemented by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for financial instruments created before the issuance date of the statement and still existing at the beginning of the period of adoption. Adoption of this interpretation did not have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Volatility in interest rates and foreign exchange rates can impact our earnings, equity and cash flow. From time to time we undertake transactions to hedge this impact. Under governing accounting guidelines, a hedge instrument is considered effective if it offsets partially or completely the impact on earnings, equity and cash flow due to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. In accordance with our policy, we do not execute derivatives that are speculative or that increase our risk from interest rate or foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long term debt obligations. We manage this risk through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate debt (See Note 6 Borrowings and Credit Facilities). At November 1, 2003 we were not party to any interest rate derivative contracts. Foreign exchange derivatives at that date were exclusively in the form of forward exchange contracts executed over the counter. There is a concentration of these contracts held with LaSalle Bank, N.A. as agent for ABN Amro Bank, N.V. which maintains an investment grade rating. Foreign Currency Risk Our foreign subsidiaries use local currencies as their functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at month end exchange rates. Items of income and expense are translated at average exchange rates. Translation gains and losses are not included in determining net income (loss) but are accumulated as a separate component of shareholders equity (deficit). Gains (losses) arising from foreign currency transactions are included in determining net income (loss). During Fiscal 2003, we incurred a loss of $337,000 arising from foreign currency transactions. We have adopted a Foreign Exchange Risk Management Policy. It is a risk averse policy under which significant exposures that impact earnings and cash flow are fully hedged. Exposures that impact only equity or do not have a cash flow impact are generally not hedged with derivatives. There are two categories of foreign exchange exposures that are hedged: assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency, which include net investment of a foreign subsidiary, and future committed receipts or payments denominated in a foreign currency. These exposures normally arise from imports and exports of goods and from intercompany trade and lending activity. The fair value of our forward exchange contracts at November 1, 2003 is analyzed in the following table of dollar equivalent terms: Maturing in 2004 In thousands of US Dollars Buy Sell U.S. Dollar (2,868 ) 935 Australian Dollar 1 British Pound 55 South African Rand (199 ) Euro 36
