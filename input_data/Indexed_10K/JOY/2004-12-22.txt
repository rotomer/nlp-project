Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes. References made to years are for fiscal year periods. Dollar amounts are in thousands, except share and per share data and as indicated. The purpose of this discussion and analysis is to enhance the understanding and evaluation of the results of operations, financial position, cash flows, indebtedness, and other key financial information of Joy Global Inc. and its subsidiaries for Fiscal 2004, Fiscal 2003, and Fiscal 2002. For a more complete understanding of this discussion, please read the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. Overview We are the direct successor to businesses that have been manufacturing mining equipment for over 120 years. We operate in two business segments: Underground Mining Machinery, comprised of our Joy Mining Machinery business (Joy), and Surface Mining Equipment, comprised of our P&H Mining Equipment business (P&H). Joy is the worlds largest producer of high productivity electric powered underground mining equipment used primarily for the extraction of coal. P&H is the worlds largest producer of high productivity electric mining shovels and a leading producer of walking draglines and large rotary blasthole drills, used primarily for surface mining copper, coal, iron ore, oil sands and other minerals. Over 87% of our sales are to the coal and copper mining industries. In addition to selling new equipment, we provide parts, components, repairs, rebuilds, diagnostic analysis, fabrication, training and other aftermarket services for our installed base of machines. In the case of Surface Mining Equipment, we also provide aftermarket services for equipment manufactured by other companies, including over 15 manufacturers with which we have ongoing relationships and which we refer to as Alliance Partners. We emphasize our aftermarket products and services as an integral part of lowering our customers cost per unit of production and are focused on continuing to grow this part of our business. Demand for new equipment is cyclical in nature, being driven by commodity prices and other factors. Our new equipment sales over the last five years have ranged from a high of $458.6 million in Fiscal 2004 to a low of $339.5 million in Fiscal 2001. In contrast, our aftermarket business has shown consistent growth over the past five years despite commodity production restrictions and price volatility, and helps moderate the effects of changes in new equipment demand on our financial performance. Our aftermarket sales over the last five years have grown from $741.1 million in Fiscal 2000 to $973.6 million in Fiscal 2004. Approximately 88% of our sales in Fiscal 2004 were recorded at the time of shipment of the product or delivery of the service. The remaining 12% of sales was recorded using percentage of completion accounting, a practice we follow in recognizing revenue on the sale of long lead time equipment such as electric mining shovels, walking draglines and roof supports. Under percentage of completion accounting, revenue is recognized on firm orders from customers as the product is manufactured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to estimated total costs to be incurred. We generally receive progress payments on long lead time equipment. The major components of our cost of sales are manufacturing overhead, labor and raw materials such as steel. We have taken significant steps to reduce manufacturing overhead. In recent years, we have been adversely affected by increases in the cost of raw materials, specifically steel. The mix of original equipment and aftermarket sales affects our operating profit. Our aftermarket products and services generally carry higher margins than our original equipment and increases in our aftermarket sales have a favorable impact on our profitability. Although steel prices increased, our gross profit margin in Fiscal 2004 increase to 26.7% from 24.1% in Fiscal 2003. In Fiscal 2004, approximately 47% of our sales were made to customers from the United States. With the exception of South Africa, our domestic and international sales are largely denominated in U.S. dollars or pounds sterling. From time to time, we hedge specifically identified committed cash flows using foreign currency sale or purchase contracts. On June 7, 1999, the Predecessor Company and substantially all of its domestic operating subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. Our Plan of Reorganization (the POR) was confirmed on May 29, 2001. We formally emerged from bankruptcy on the July 12, 2001 (the Effective Date). As part of our emergence, we adopted fresh start accounting pursuant to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 90 7, Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code (SOP 90 7). In accordance with fresh start accounting principles, our assets and liabilities were adjusted to their fair value as of the Effective Date and the excess of our enterprise value over the fair value of our tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities was reported as excess reorganization value in our consolidated balance sheet. The net effect of fresh start accounting adjustments was a gain of $45.1 million which was recorded in the income statement for the Predecessor Company during Fiscal 2001. As a result of the application of fresh start accounting, our financial statements are not comparable to those of the Predecessor Company. Results of Operations 2004 Compared with 2003 Sales The following table sets forth Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003 net sales as derived from our Consolidated Statement of Income: In thousands Fiscal 2004 Fiscal 2003 $ Change % Change Net Sales Underground Mining Machinery $ 820,121 $ 685,999 $ 134,122 19 .6% Surface Mining Equipment 612,046 529,967 82,079 15 .5% Total $ 1,432,167 $ 1,215,966 $ 216,201 17 .8% Total net sales for Fiscal 2004 increased by $216.2 million, or 17.8%, over Fiscal 2003 net sales. Net sales in the United States increased by $90.2 million, or 15.5%, and net sales in the rest of the world rose by $126.0, or 19.9%. Reflecting the cyclical upturn in commodities, original equipment revenues increased by 34.9% to $458.6 million in Fiscal 2004, accounting for 32.0% of total revenues for the year. We anticipate this percentage to increase further in Fiscal 2005. Aftermarket sales, which include sales of parts and services, increased 11.1% to $973.6 million for Fiscal 2004. The increase in Underground Mining Machinery net sales in Fiscal 2004 was the result of an increase in original equipment product shipments and, to a lesser extent, aftermarket sales. New machine sales booked through the United Kingdom increased due to a large roof support order and an increase in armored face conveyor shipments to both the United Kingdom and China. South Africa recovered from depressed levels of prior year new machine sales with increased shipments of continuous miners in Fiscal 2004. New machine sales increased in Australia primarily due to an increase in shipments of roof supports, longwall shearers and armored face conveyors, which were partially offset by a decline in sales of continuous miners. United States new machine sales were down slightly due to decreases in shipments of roof supports and armored face conveyors partially offset by increased shipments of continuous miners and shuttle cars. Aftermarket sales showed significant improvement in the United States while revenues from South Africa benefited from the weakness of the U.S. dollar and the favorable impact of translating South African Rand sales into U.S. dollars. Those increases in aftermarket sales were partially offset by a decrease in complete machine rebuilds in Australia primarily due to unusually high levels of sales in Fiscal 2003. Throughout the markets we serve both our new machine and aftermarket sales have benefited from the prices our customers receive for their coal. Activity levels in the emerging markets, including China, continued the high level of activity we began to see in Fiscal 2003. The increase in Surface Mining Equipment net sales in Fiscal 2004 was a result of increases in new and used equipment shipments, as well as aftermarket parts and service sales. The increase in new equipment was due to higher sales of electric mining shovels in both Russia and the United States and U.S. sales of loading equipment manufactured by our Alliance Partners. The increase in U.S. new equipment sales was driven by stronger demand in the coal and iron ore markets. The Russian shovel sale, which was the first new electric mining shovel sold in Russia, was attributable to increased activity in the coal market. An increase in sales of used electric mining shovels was attributable to shipments to both Russia and Zambia. In the aftermarket, sales of replacement parts increased primarily in South America and the Southwestern United States. Service sales were strong in Brazil, Chile, South Africa and the United States, partially offset by lower service sales in Canada. Operating Income The following table sets forth Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003 operating income as derived from our Consolidated Statement of Income: In thousands Fiscal 2004 Fiscal 2003 $ Change % Change Operating income (loss): Underground Mining Machinery $ 91,376 $ 43,573 $ 47,803 109 .7% Surface Mining Equipment 53,189 27,572 25,617 92 .9% Corporate Expense (36,884 ) (23,463 ) (13,421 ) 57 .2% Total $ 107,681 $ 47,682 $ 59,999 125 .8% Operating income for Underground Mining Machinery increased by approximately $47.8 million in Fiscal 2004 as compared to Fiscal 2003. During Fiscal 2004, charges for the depreciation and amortization of the fresh start accounting items decreased by approximately $3.0 million. Excluding the impact of the charges for fresh start, the increase in operating income for Fiscal 2004 was $44.8 million. The high volume of sales favorably impacted operating income in Fiscal 2004. Increased sales activity allowed for higher levels of manufacturing overhead absorption that exceeded the increase in the variable overhead spending in the United States, United Kingdom and South Africa. These favorable impacts were partially offset by increases in our variable selling expenses, engineering expenses associated with new product development, compensation expenses associated with performance based incentive programs and the cost of steel used to manufacture our products. Expenses in the United States and United Kingdom in Fiscal 2004 were positively affected by the restructuring activity that took place in Fiscal 2003. Operating income for Surface Mining Equipment increased by approximately $25.6 million in Fiscal 2004 as compared to Fiscal 2003. During Fiscal 2004, charges for the depreciation and amortization of the fresh start accounting items decreased by approximately $3.4 million. Excluding the impact of the charges for fresh start, the increase in operating income for Fiscal 2004 was $22.2 million. The increase in operating income for Surface Mining Equipment was the result of an increase in net sales in Fiscal 2004 and a significant increase in manufacturing absorption associated with the higher volume of production of new machines and parts in this segments manufacturing facilities. These favorable impacts on margins were partially offset by compensation expenses associated with performance based incentive programs, higher prices for steel and components, foreign currency exchange rates, severance payments and higher pension costs. The increase in the corporate expense was primarily attributable to compensation expense associated with performance based incentive programs. Product Development, Selling and Administrative Expense Product development, selling and administrative expense for Fiscal 2004 was $277.4 million, after fresh start charges of $2.8 million, as compared to $241.5 million, after fresh start charges of $9.0 million, for Fiscal 2003. The increase in product development, selling and administrative expense was due primarily to increases in pension expense, compensation expense associated with performance based incentive programs and the impact associated with the translation of non U.S. expenses into U.S. dollars due to exchange rate fluctuations. These increases were partially offset by cost reductions associated with our strategic sourcing initiative. Product development, selling and administrative expense as a percentage of sales for Fiscal 2004 decreased to 19.4% as compared to 19.9% in Fiscal 2003. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Pension expense for Fiscal 2004 was $22.0 million compared to pension expense of $14.2 million in Fiscal 2003. The increase in pension expense is primarily the result of a reduction in the discount rate for the pension plans in the United States from 7.0% to 6.25%. These plans represented approximately 56% of our total pension plan assets as of the end of Fiscal 2004. Interest Expense Interest expense for Fiscal 2004 decreased to $24.3 million as compared to $27.0 million for Fiscal 2003. This decrease was principally due to our repayment of two industrial revenue bonds in late Fiscal 2003. There were no direct borrowings under our revolving credit agreement in Fiscal 2004. Cash interest paid in Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003 was $22.0 million and $23.1 million, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes Our consolidated effective income tax rates for Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003 were approximately 41.5% and 33.6%, respectively. Consolidated income tax expense increased to $39.2 million in Fiscal 2004 as compared to an expense of $9.4 million in Fiscal 2003. The increase in income tax expense is primarily attributable to increases in global profitability and the provision for deferred tax valuation reserves in certain jurisdictions where we operate based upon concerns relating to the future realizability of certain deferred tax assets. 2003 Compared with 2002 Sales The following table sets forth Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002 net sales as derived from our Consolidated Statement of Income: In thousands Fiscal 2003 Fiscal 2002 $ Change % Change Net Sales Underground Mining Machinery $ 685,999 $ 745,714 $ (59,715 ) (8 .0)% Surface Mining Equipment 529,967 405,133 124,834 30 .8% Total $ 1,215,966 $ 1,150,847 $ 65,119 5 .7% The decrease in Underground Mining Machinery net sales in Fiscal 2003 was a result of lower new machine shipments and replacement parts sales partially offset by an increase in component repairs and complete machine rebuilds. The decrease in new machine sales was due to lower sales of continuous miners, shuttle cars and roof supports in the United States, lower sales of shuttle cars in South Africa, and lower sales of roof supports in the United Kingdom. New machine shipments increased in Australia due to roof support shipments and the shipment of several continuous miners specifically designed for the Australian market. Aftermarket shipments for repair parts in the United States, United Kingdom and the emerging markets served out of the United Kingdom were softer in Fiscal 2003 as compared to Fiscal 2002. Although aftermarket sales in the emerging markets served out of the United Kingdom in Fiscal 2003 did not match the record levels of Fiscal 2002, aftermarket parts shipments into these markets remained strong, despite a temporary interruption of orders due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in China. Aftermarket product shipments in South Africa were strong, principally due to maintenance and life cycle programs to support current equipment and the favorable impact of translating South African Rand sales into U.S. dollars. Mild summer and winter weather during Fiscal 2003 and the delay of the economic recovery in the United States adversely affected Joys new machine and aftermarket businesses. The increase in Surface Mining Equipment net sales in Fiscal 2003 was a result of an increase in new equipment shipments, aftermarket parts and service sales. The increase in new equipment was due to higher sales of electric mining shovels in both South America and Canada. The increase in South American shovel sales was provided by a stronger demand in the copper market. The increase in Canadian shovel sales was attributed to activity in the oil sands. In the aftermarket, sales of replacement parts increased in North and South America, Southern Africa, China and India. Service sales were strong in Australia, which included erection of a dragline, and in South America. Operating Income The following table sets forth Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002 operating income as derived from our Consolidated Statement of Income: In thousands Fiscal 2003 Fiscal 2002 $ Change % Change Operating income (loss): Underground Mining Machinery $ 43,573 $ 19,516 $ 24,057 123 .3% Surface Mining Equipment 27,572 (18,157 ) 45,729 251 .9% Corporate Expense (23,463 ) (16,502 ) (6,961 ) 42 .2% Total $ 47,682 $ (15,143 ) $ 62,825 414 .9% Operating income for Underground Mining Machinery increased by approximately $24.1 million in Fiscal 2003 as compared to Fiscal 2002. Charges for the depreciation and amortization of the fresh start accounting items decreased by approximately $37.8 million. Excluding the impact of the charges for fresh start, the decrease in operating income for Fiscal 2003 was $13.8 million. This decrease included a $5.1 million charge associated with manufacturing capacity rationalization in the United States and restructuring in the United Kingdom and Australia. Operating income was negatively impacted by unfavorable manufacturing absorption associated with the decrease in production of new machines and an increase in both compensation expense associated with performance based incentive programs and pension expense in the United States and the United Kingdom. Operating income was positively affected by the elimination of unfavorable manufacturing variances associated with the manufacture of roof supports in Fiscal 2002, the favorable impact of our strategic sourcing initiative, and warranty expense improvements through our quality initiative. Operating income for Surface Mining Equipment increased by approximately $45.7 million in Fiscal 2003 as compared to Fiscal 2002. During Fiscal 2003, charges for the depreciation and amortization of the fresh start accounting items decreased by approximately $21.8 million. Excluding the impact of the charges for fresh start, the increase in operating income for Fiscal 2003 was $23.9 million. The increase in operating income for Surface Mining Equipment was the result of an increase in net sales in Fiscal 2003 and a significant increase in manufacturing absorption associated with the higher volume of production of new machines in this segments manufacturing facilities. Lower production volumes in Fiscal 2002 resulted in workforce reduction that increased severance and medical benefit costs at our Milwaukee manufacturing facility that was not repeated during Fiscal 2003. These favorable impacts on margins were partially offset by the sales mix, which included a sale of a dragline in Australia, and by compensation expenses associated with performance based incentive programs. The increase in the corporate expense was primarily attributable to compensation expense associated with performance based incentive programs. Product Development, Selling and Administrative Expense Product development, selling and administrative expense for Fiscal 2003 was $241.5 million, after fresh start charges of $9.0 million, as compared to $212.8 million, after fresh start charges of $14.0 million, for Fiscal 2002. The increase in product development, selling and administrative expense was due primarily to increases in pension expense, medical costs, general insurance costs, compensation expense associated with performance based incentive programs and the impact associated with the translation of non U.S. expenses into U.S. dollars due to exchange rate fluctuations. These increases were partially offset by cost reductions associated with our strategic sourcing initiative. Product development, selling and administrative expense as a percentage of sales for Fiscal 2003 increased to 19.9% as compared to 18.5% in Fiscal 2002. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Pension expense for Fiscal 2003 was $14.2 million compared to pension expense of $2.7 million in Fiscal 2002. The increase in pension expense is the result of a reduction in the expected rate of return on plan assets assumption and a decrease in market value of plan assets from the beginning of the year. For Fiscal 2003 we reduced the return on asset assumption for the pension plans in the United States and the United Kingdom from 9.5% to 9.0% and 9.5% to 7.5%, respectively. These plans represented in excess of 98% of our total pension plan assets as of the end of Fiscal 2003. These rate of return on assets assumptions are based primarily on the targeted investment asset mix and the expected rates of return on the individual components of the investment mix. Interest Expense Interest expense for Fiscal 2003 decreased to $27.0 million as compared to $31.0 for Fiscal 2002. This decrease was principally due to our repayment of a term loan in Fiscal 2002 and reduced borrowings under our revolving credit agreement. There were no direct borrowings under our revolving credit agreement in Fiscal 2003. Cash interest paid in Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002 was $23.1 million and $27.7 million, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes The consolidated effective income tax rates for Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002 are approximately 34% and 40%, respectively. Consolidated income tax expense increased to $9.4 million in Fiscal 2003 as compared to a benefit of $17.5 million in Fiscal 2002. The increase in income tax expense is primarily attributed to the income earned in Fiscal 2003 as compared to the loss incurred in Fiscal 2002. The principal driver differentiating the tax rate between the two years is the change in the global mix of earnings in jurisdictions whose effective tax rates are lower than the U.S. statutory rate, partially offset in Fiscal 2003 by the provision of taxes against certain accumulated earnings of our South African subsidiary. Reorganization Items Reorganization items include income, expenses and losses that were realized or incurred as a result of the decision to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Net reorganization items for Fiscal 2004, Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002 consisted of the following: In thousands (income) expense Fiscal 2004 Fiscal 2003 Fiscal 2002 Distribution from Beloit Liquidating Trust $ (2,856 ) $ $ Beloit Liquidating Trust settlement (2,336 ) Beloit U.K. claim settlement (1,774 ) (3,333 ) Other net (1,041 ) (573 ) (382 ) Professional fees directly related to the filing 1,165 1,495 352 Collection of Beloit note (7,200 ) Net reorganization income $ (6,842 ) $ (2,411 ) $ (7,230 ) Restructuring and Other Special Charges Costs associated with restructuring activities other than those activities covered by SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, or that involve an entity newly acquired in a business combination, are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. Costs associated with such activities are recorded as restructuring costs in the consolidated statements of income when the liability is incurred. During Fiscal 2003, we began implementing a manufacturing capacity rationalization at our P&H Mining Equipment Milwaukee location that reduced factory space by 350,000 square feet and resulted in a facility that is more efficient. The Fiscal 2003 rationalization plan at P&H was completed in Fiscal 2004 at a cost of $2.0 million. During Fiscal 2003, Joy Mining Machinery began implementing a manufacturing capacity rationalization plan for North America. Total costs for the Joy North American manufacturing capacity rationalization were $3.7 million. Included in this amount is $1.5 million for one time termination benefits for 132 employees, $0.8 million for abandoned assets, and $1.4 million for other associated costs. Also during Fiscal 2003, Joy Mining Machinery began implementing a manufacturing capacity rationalization plan for the United Kingdom and Australia. The total costs for the United Kingdom manufacturing capacity rationalization were $1.6 million for one time termination benefits for 26 employees. The total costs for the Australian manufacturing capacity rationalization were $0.2 million for one time termination benefits for 27 employees. The Fiscal 2003 rationalization plan at Joy was completed in Fiscal 2004. Below is a summary of the activity related to restructuring costs recorded pursuant to SFAS No. 144 and SFAS No.146.

The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to bad debts, excess inventory, warranty, intangible assets, income taxes and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the accounting policies described below are the ones that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments, and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results of operations: Revenue Recognition We generally recognize revenue at the time of shipment and passage of title for sales of products and at the time of performance for sales of services. We recognize revenue on long term contracts, such as the manufacture of mining shovels, drills, draglines and roof support systems, using either the percentage of completion or completed contract methods. When using the percentage of completion method, sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion. Sales and gross profit are adjusted prospectively for revisions in estimated total contract costs and contract values. Estimated losses are recognized in full when identified. We have life cycle management contracts with customers to supply parts and service for terms of 1 to 13 years. These contracts are set up based on the projected costs and revenues of servicing the respective machines over the specified contract terms. Customers are generally billed monthly and the respective deferred revenues are recorded when billed. Revenue is recognized in the period in which parts are supplied or services provided. Revenue recognition involves judgments, assessments of expected returns, the likelihood of nonpayment, and estimates of expected costs and profits on long term contracts. We analyze various factors, including a review of specific transactions, historical experience, credit worthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions, in determining when to recognize revenue. Changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized with a resulting impact on the timing and amount of associated income. Inventories Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market using the first in, first out method of accounting. We evaluate all inventory, including raw material, work in process, finished goods and spare parts, for realizability on a regular basis. Inherent in our estimates of net realizable value are estimates related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, possible alternative uses and ultimate realizable value of potentially excess inventory. We fully reserve for inventory identified as obsolete inventory. Intangible Assets Intangible assets include software, drawings, patents, trademarks, unpatented technology and other specifically identifiable intangible assets. We review the carrying value of our intangible assets on an annual basis or more frequently as circumstances warrant. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and valued on a relief from royalty basis using future revenues discounted over the timeframe of economic benefit. Intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets using undiscounted cash flows. While we believe that our estimates of future revenues and cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions regarding revenues and cash flows could materially affect our evaluations. Accrued Warranties We record accruals for potential warranty claims based on prior claim experience. Warranty costs are accrued at the time revenue is recognized. These warranty costs are based upon managements assessment of past claims and current experience. However, actual claims could be higher or lower than amounts estimated, as the amount and value of warranty claims are subject to variation as a result of many factors that cannot be predicted with certainty. Pension and Postretirement Benefits and Costs We have pension benefits and expenses which are developed from actuarial valuations. These valuations are based on assumptions including, among other things, discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, retirement ages, years of service, and future salary increases. Future changes affecting the assumptions will change the related pension benefit or expense. Income Taxes Deferred taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using statutory tax rates. Deferred income tax provisions are based on changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities from period to period, adjusted for certain reclassifications under fresh start accounting. In addition, we analyze our ability to recognize currently the net deferred tax assets created in each jurisdiction in which we operate to determine if valuation allowances are necessary because realizability of the tax assets is deemed to not be more likely than not. Prior to Fiscal 2002, we determined that we did not meet the requirements that would allow us to record the future benefits of any net operating losses, tax credits or net deferred tax assets for financial reporting purposes due to our emergence from bankruptcy in Fiscal 2001. As a result, we recorded valuation reserves as necessary to reduce the book value of our net deferred tax asset to zero. After Fiscal 2001, we have annually assessed on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis the need for either the recording of or release of valuation reserves. During Fiscal 2002, we reviewed this position and, based upon past, current and future operating performance, expectations and available tax strategies, did not provide full valuation allowances for new net deferred tax assets as of November 2, 2002. Additionally, in Fiscal 2002 we released all non U.S. deferred tax valuation reserves recorded at the end of Fiscal 2001 (except for those of certain Australian business segments as we concluded that the utilization of these assets is not more likely than not) and a portion of the reserves recorded against the net U.S. asset based upon projected future net operating loss utilization. For Fiscal 2003, we performed a similar realization analysis for all deferred tax assets and again did not provide full valuation allowances for new net deferred tax assets created as of November 1, 2003. Additional amounts of valuation reserves related to U.S. and Australian net operating loss carryforwards were released based upon a tax restructuring in Australia and projected future net operating loss utilization. In Fiscal 2004, we have reassessed our gross deferred tax assets as they relate to our Australian operations and our U.S. State tax loss carryforwards. Based upon the results of this analysis, valuation reserves were provided against those amounts not already reserved due to potential issues as to ultimate utilization of these amounts. As required under the application of fresh start accounting, the release of pre emergence tax valuation reserves was not recorded in the income statement but instead was treated first as a reduction of excess reorganization value until exhausted, then intangibles until exhausted, and thereafter reported as additional paid in capital. Consequently, a net tax charge will be incurred in future years when these tax assets are utilized. We will continue to monitor the appropriateness of the existing valuation allowances and determine annually the amount of valuation allowances that are required to be maintained. We estimate the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year during the course of the year on an interim basis. The estimated effective tax rate contemplates the expected jurisdiction where income is earned (e.g. United States compared to non United States) as well as tax planning strategies. If the actual results are different from these estimates, adjustments to the effective tax rate may be required in the period such determination is made. Additionally, discreet items are treated separately from the effective rate analysis and are recorded separately as an income tax provision or benefit at the time they are recognized. To the extent recognized, these items will impact the effective tax rate in aggregate but will not adjust the amount used for future periods within the same fiscal year. Liquidity and Capital Resources Working capital and cash flow are two financial measurements which provide an indication of our ability to meet our financial obligations. We currently use cash generated by operations to fund continuing operations. The following table summarizes the major elements of our working capital at the end of Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003: In millions October 30, 2004 November 1, 2003 Cash and cash equivalents $ 231 .7 $ 148 .5 Accounts receivable 260 .0 193 .9 Inventories 443 .8 382 .9 Other current assets 56 .6 51 .3 Short term debt (3 .1) (4 .8) Accounts payable (139 .2) (89 .1) Employee compensation and benefits (82 .5) (57 .7) Advance payments and progress billings (87 .5) (36 .7) Income taxes payable (4 .9) (26 .1) Other current liabilities (114 .7) (111 .3) Working Capital $ 560 .2 $ 450 .9 Our businesses are working capital intensive and require funding for purchases of production and replacement parts inventories. In addition, cash is required for capital expenditures for the repair, replacement and upgrading of existing facilities. We have debt service requirements, including semi annual interest payments on our senior subordinated notes as well as commitment and letter of credit fees under our revolving credit facility. We believe that cash generated from operations, together with borrowings available under our credit facility, provides us with adequate liquidity to meet our operating and debt service requirements and planned capital expenditures. Cash provided by operations for Fiscal 2004 was $62.3 million as compared to $105.6 million provided by operations for Fiscal 2003. The primary change in our cash from operations was attributable to the increase in net income offset by the contributions to our pension plans and the usage of working capital. Approximately $30.9 million was provided from working capital in Fiscal 2004 while approximately $87.5 million was provided from working capital in Fiscal 2003. The most significant working capital changes affecting the usage of cash from Fiscal 2003 to Fiscal 2004 related to inventories and accounts receivable. Inventories were increased to provide for the increase in orders while the timing of year end sales resulted in a significant increase in outstanding accounts receivable. The most significant working capital changes providing an increase of cash from Fiscal 2003 to Fiscal 2004 related to advance payments and trade accounts payable. The timing of cash received from customers and payments to outside vendors contributed to increased advance payments and trade accounts payable balances at the end of Fiscal 2004. During Fiscal 2004, we contributed $95.4 million to our worldwide pension plans compared to $53.8 million during Fiscal 2003. As a result of the additional contributions in Fiscal 2004, we do not expect that additional contributions for U.S. plans will be required in fiscal 2005. However, we currently believe we will make voluntary contributions for our U.S. plans in the range of $20 million to $40 million in Fiscal 2005. Beyond Fiscal 2005, the investment performance of the plans assets and the actual results of the other actuarial assumptions will determine the funding requirements of the pension plans. Cash used by investment activities for Fiscal 2004 was $11.1 million as compared to $30.5 million used by investment activities for Fiscal 2003. Approximately $21.1 million and $27.5 million were used for capital expenditures in Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003, respectively. For Fiscal 2005, we anticipate capital expenditures between $30 million and $40 million, primarily for maintenance of existing facilities, completion of SAP implementation, and other projects. In addition, approximately $12.3 million was used in Fiscal 2003 to acquire the 25% interest in our Australian surface mining equipment subsidiary held by Kobelco Construction Machinery Co. Limited. Cash provided by financing activities for Fiscal 2004 was $27.6 million as compared to $10.0 million used by financing activities for Fiscal 2003. The increase in Fiscal 2004 primarily resulted from the exercise of stock options generating $44.7 million partially offset by the dividends paid of $14.0 million. In Fiscal 2003, approximately $12.5 million was used to retire industrial revenue bonds. Credit Facilities On January 23, 2004, we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) relating to a $200 million revolving credit facility maturing on October 15, 2008. Substantially all of our assets and our domestic subsidiaries assets, other than real estate, are pledged as collateral under the Credit Agreement. Outstanding borrowings bear interest equal to either LIBOR plus the applicable margin (3.25% to 2.00%) or the Base Rate (defined as the higher of the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%) plus the applicable margin (2.25% to 1.00%) at our option depending on certain of our financial ratios. We pay a commitment fee ranging from 0.50% to 0.75% on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility. In 2002, we issued $200 million in 8.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due March 15, 2012. In December 2004 we repurchased $14.5 million of these notes. Both the Credit Agreement and Senior Subordinated Note Indenture contain restrictions and financial covenants relating to, among other things, minimum financial performance and limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, liens, asset sales, and capital expenditures. The covenants in the Senior Subordinated Note Indenture are generally less restrictive than the covenants in the Credit Agreement. Interest coverage, leverage and fixed charge coverage covenants in the Credit Agreement generally become more restrictive over the term of the Agreement. At October 30, 2004, we were in compliance with all financial covenants in the Credit Agreement and the Indenture. At October 30, 2004, there were no outstanding direct borrowings under the Credit Agreement. Outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement, which count toward the $200 million credit limit, totaled $79.8 million. The amount available for borrowings under the Credit Agreement is also limited by a borrowing base calculation. At October 30, 2004, there was $120.2 million available for borrowings under the Credit Agreement. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We lease various assets under operating leases. The aggregate payments under operating leases as of October 30, 2004 are disclosed in the table of Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments below. No significant changes to lease commitments have occurred since October 30, 2004. We have no other off balance sheet arrangements. Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of October 30, 2004: In thousands Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Long Term Debt $ 200,267 $ $ $ 267 $ 200,000 Short Term Notes Payable 2,297 2,297 Capital Lease Obligations 3,415 813 1,351 184 1,067 Purchase Obligations 21,526 6,244 12,373 1,682 1,227 Operating Leases 31,543 12,270 10,727 2,879 5,667 Total $ 259,048 $ 21,624 $ 24,451 $ 5,012 $ 207,961 Market Conditions and Outlook Market conditions in most of the commodity markets served by our customers remain robust. Coal markets in the United States continue to strengthen in both pricing and demand. Higher spot coal prices are expected over time to be reflected in higher prices in supply contracts. Demand for coal is being positively affected by continued high natural gas prices, reduced imports of coal into the United States from South America, and increases in exports of metallurgical coal from the United States. Coal producers in the United States are increasing their production levels and capital spending plans. The increase in production levels is primarily occurring in existing mine operations, which we believe is leading to the increasing demand for replacement equipment as operators drive for more production from the same reserves. The international coal markets continue to be strong with rising prices for both thermal and metallurgical coal. Capacity levels in port facilities have resulted in shipping constraints in both South Africa and Australia. China continues to take steps in the long term to convert its underground coal industry to high productivity mining methods. Efforts by the Chinese banking regulators to reduce investment in areas such as steel and real estate while encouraging investments in power plants, railroads, and coal should reduce the risk of capital availability and be a positive contributor to this conversion. We continue to believe we will experience solid, long term, double digit growth in China, both for our underground mining machinery and our aftermarket parts and service activities. Markets served by P&H in surface mining are strong across the board. Copper, the largest of these markets, continues to enjoy strong pricing. Copper producers are increasing production at a number of mines and developing plans and ordering equipment for new mines. Although new original equipment orders were limited in the third and fourth quarters, interest remains high, particularly in copper and the oil sands markets. As with Joy on the underground side of our business, order books are filling well into 2005. Several factors temper our outlook. We believe that the current increases in purchases for mining equipment and services will be affected by our customers efforts to constrain their production and capital spending. As we increase our production to meet the increased demand for mining equipment, our challenge is to manage our working capital and the other aspects of our business so that we meet the needs of our customers while maximizing returns to shareholders. We will need to continue to control pension and health care costs. Our ability to grow revenues is constrained by the capacity of our plants, our ability to supplement that capacity with outside sources, and our success in securing critical supplies such as steel and copper. The positive effects we are seeing on our business as a result of higher customer production and capital spending levels could be offset by customer restraints on production and capital spending, capacity limitations at our facilities, and continuing tight steel supplies. New Accounting Pronouncements On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payments (SFAS 123(R)). SFAS 123(R) replaces FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. The FASB has concluded that companies could adopt the new standard in one of two ways: the modified prospective transition method and the modified retrospective transition method. Using the modified prospective transition method, a company would recognize share based employee compensation cost from the beginning of the fiscal period in which the recognition provisions are first applied as if the fair value based accounting method had been used to account for all employee awards granted, modified, or settled after the effective date and to any awards that were not fully vested as of the effective date. Using the modified retrospective method, a company would recognize employee compensation cost for periods presented prior to the adoption of the proposed standard in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123; that is, an entity would recognize employee compensation cost in the amounts reported in the pro forma disclosures provided in accordance with SFAS No. 123. A company would not be permitted to make any changes to those amounts upon adoption of the proposed standard unless those changes represent a correction of an error (and are disclosed accordingly). For periods after the date of adoption of the proposed standard, the modified prospective transition method described above would be applied. We will adopt SFAS No. 123(R) and will continue to evaluate the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our results of operations. On May 19, 2004, FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) 106 2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. This statement applies to the sponsor of a single employer defined benefit postretirement health care plan for which (a) the employer has concluded that prescription drug benefits available under the plan to some or all participants for some or all future years are actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D and thus qualify for the subsidy under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003; and (b) the expected subsidy will offset or reduce the employers share of the cost of the underlying postretirement prescription drug coverage on which the subsidy is based. FSP No. 106 2 became effective for us on September 1, 2004 and did not have a material effect on us. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Volatility in interest rates and foreign exchange rates can impact our earnings, equity and cash flow. From time to time we undertake transactions to hedge this impact. Under governing accounting guidelines, a hedge instrument is considered effective if it offsets partially or completely the impact on earnings, equity and cash flow due to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. In accordance with our policy, we do not execute derivatives that are speculative or that increase our risk from interest rate or foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long term debt obligations. We manage this risk through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate debt (See Note 4 Borrowings and Credit Facilities). At October 30, 2004 we were not party to any interest rate derivative contracts. Foreign Currency Risk Most of our foreign subsidiaries use local currencies as their functional currency. For consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities are translated at month end exchange rates. Items of income and expense are translated at average exchange rates. Translation gains and losses are not included in determining net income (loss) but are accumulated as a separate component of shareholders equity. Gains (losses) arising from foreign currency transactions are included in determining net income (loss). During Fiscal 2004, we incurred a loss of $570,000 arising from foreign currency transactions. Foreign exchange derivatives at October 30, 2004 were in the form of forward exchange contracts executed over the counter. There is a concentration of these contracts held with LaSalle Bank, N.A. as agent for ABN Amro Bank, N.V. which maintains an investment grade rating. We have adopted a Foreign Exchange Risk Management Policy. It is a risk averse policy under which significant exposures that impact earnings and cash flow are fully hedged. Exposures that impact only equity or do not have a cash flow impact are generally not hedged with derivatives. There are two categories of foreign exchange exposures that are hedged: assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency, which include net investment in a foreign subsidiary, and future committed receipts or payments denominated in a foreign currency. These exposures normally arise from imports and exports of goods and from intercompany trade and lending activity. The fair value of our forward exchange contracts at October 30, 2004 is analyzed in the following table of dollar equivalent terms: In thousands of US Dollars Maturing in 2005 Buy Sell U.S. Dollar (1,147 ) 2,360 Australian Dollar 13 1 British Pound Sterling 106 (3 ) South African Rand (143 ) (8 ) Euro 33 (21 )
