Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes. References made to years are for fiscal year periods. Dollar amounts are in thousands, except share and per share data and as indicated. The purpose of this discussion and analysis is to enhance the understanding and evaluation of the results of operations, financial position, cash flows, indebtedness, and other key financial information of Joy Global Inc. and its subsidiaries for Fiscal 2006, Fiscal 2005, and Fiscal 2004. For a more complete understanding of this discussion, please read the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. Overview We are the direct successor to businesses that have been manufacturing mining equipment for over 120 years. We operate in two business segments: Underground Mining Machinery, comprised of our Joy Mining Machinery business ("Joy), and Surface Mining Equipment, comprised of our P&H Mining Equipment business ("P&H). Joy is the worlds largest producer of high productivity electric powered underground mining equipment used primarily for the extraction of coal. P&H is the worlds largest producer of high productivity electric mining shovels and a leading producer of walking draglines and large rotary blasthole drills, used primarily for surface mining copper, coal, iron ore, oil sands and other minerals. In addition to selling new equipment, we provide parts, components, repairs, rebuilds, diagnostic analysis, fabrication, training and other aftermarket services for our installed base of machines. In the case of Surface Mining Equipment, we also provide aftermarket services for equipment manufactured by other companies, including manufacturers with which we have ongoing relationships and which we refer to as "Alliance Partners. We emphasize our aftermarket products and services as an integral part of lowering our customers cost per unit of production and are focused on continuing to grow this part of our business. Demand for new equipment is cyclical in nature, being driven by commodity prices and other factors. Original equipment sales have ranged from $316.4 million in Fiscal 2001 to $937.8 million in Fiscal 2006. Our aftermarket business has shown more consistent growth since Fiscal 2001 with sales ranging from $799.8 million in 2001 to $1.5 billion in Fiscal 2006. Aftermarket represented about 61% of our 2006 revenues. Along with record revenues in Fiscal 2006, our backlog has also continued to grow. Our backlog of $1.1 billion as of October 29, 2005 increased to $1.3 billion as of October 28, 2006. The continued strength of commodity markets, including copper, iron ore, oil and international coal, support our belief in sustained demand for original equipment and aftermarket services. Sustained demand for our equipment and aftermarket services globally has led to further expansion plans in Fiscal 2006. During Fiscal 2006, the surface mining business made additional investments in the Milwaukee facility that will increase shovel capacity by 40%. The underground mining business is making a significant investment in China, with an expansion of a current service center in Baotou and the construction of a manufacturing facility in Tianjin. In Fiscal 2006 we also completed the acquisition of the Stamler business. The Stamler acquisition is in line with our acquisition strategy of adding mining related products and services that integrate into our existing businesses. Fiscal 2006 results continue to show the strength of this current cycle. Although the long term outlook from coal in the United States is favorable, there currently is a temporary softness due to weather related demand and we have experienced a decline in orders for U.S. underground mining equipment. Market conditions remain strong across other commodity markets including international underground coal. Approximately 85% of our sales in Fiscal 2006 were recorded at the time of shipment of the product or delivery of the service. The remaining 15% of sales was recorded using percentage of completion accounting, a practice we follow in recognizing revenue on the sale of long lead time equipment such as electric mining shovels, walking draglines and roof supports. Under percentage of completion accounting, revenue is recognized on firm orders from Page 22 customers as the product is manufactured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to estimated total costs to be incurred. We generally receive progress payments on long lead time equipment. Our gross profit margin in Fiscal 2006 increased to 31.4% from 29.2% in Fiscal 2005 due to the continued strength of commodity markets, a better mix of original equipment and disciplined cost control. The major components of our cost of sales are manufacturing overhead, labor and raw materials such as steel. In recent years, we have been adversely affected by increases in the cost of raw materials, especially steel. In Fiscal 2006, steel surcharges have continued to be added both directly and indirectly from our suppliers. Results of Operations 2006 Compared with 2005 Sales The following table sets forth Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal 2005 net sales as derived from our Consolidated Statement of Income: Fiscal Fiscal $ % In thousands 2006 2005 Change Change Net Sales Underground Mining Machinery $ 1,424,803 $ 1,132,334 $ 292,469 25.8% Surface Mining Equipment 976,907 795,140 181,767 22.9% Total $ 2,401,710 $ 1,927,474 $ 474,236 24.6% Total net sales for Fiscal 2006 increased by $474.2 million, or 24.6%, over Fiscal 2005 net sales. Net sales in the United States increased by $300.8 million, or 34.6%, and international net sales rose by $173.4 million, or 16.4%. Reflecting the continued overall strength of commodities, original equipment revenues increased by approximately 30.8% to $937.8 million in Fiscal 2006, accounting for 39.0% of total revenues for the year. Aftermarket sales, which include sales of parts and services, increased approximately 20.9% to $1.5 billion for Fiscal 2006. The increase in net sales for Underground Mining Machinery in Fiscal 2006 compared to Fiscal 2005 was the result of a $151.5 million increase in shipments of original equipment combined with a $141.0 million increase in aftermarket products and service. With the exception of roof supports sales, which were flat with Fiscal 2005, increases in original equipment sales were reported across all original equipment product lines. The United States represented $117.4 million of the increase in original equipment sales. Increases in aftermarket net sales were reported in all of our markets. Aftermarket sales increases ranging from approximately 12% in the United States to approximately 34% in emerging markets served out of the United Kingdom reflected the high level of coal mining activity on a global basis and more specifically, from our international markets. The increase in net sales for Surface Mining Equipment in Fiscal 2006 compared to Fiscal 2005 was the result of a $69.5 million increase in original equipment combined with a $112.2 million increase in aftermarket parts and service. Increases in original equipment sales were reported in the United States, Australia, Chile, Venezuela, South Africa and China offset by decreased equipment sales in Canada and Mexico. Almost two thirds of the original equipment increase related to electric mining shovels. Increases in aftermarket sales were reported for all of our significant markets. Aftermarket sales increases ranging from approximately 19% in South Africa to approximately 50% in Canada reflected the high level of copper, coal mining, and iron ore mining activity on a global basis and the high level of oil sands mining activity in Canada. Page 23 Operating Income The following table sets forth Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal 2005 operating income as derived from our Consolidated Statement of Income: Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Operating % Operating % In thousands Income (loss) of Net Sales Income (loss) of Net Sales Operating income (loss): Underground Mining Machinery $ 307,404 21.6% $ 187,288 16.5% Surface Mining Equipment 165,125 16.9% 114,375 14.4% Corporate Expense (30,132) (34,973) Total $ 442,397 18.4% $ 266,690 13.8% Operating income as a percentage of net sales for Underground Mining Machinery increased from 16.5% in Fiscal 2005 to 21.6% in Fiscal 2006. A more profitable mix of original equipment sales accounted for 2.3 percentage points of the change. Product development, selling and administrative expenses were up approximately $11.7 million in Fiscal 2006, but were down 2.3 percentage points in comparison to net sales year over year. Operating income as a percentage of net sales for Surface Mining Equipment increased from 14.4% in Fiscal 2005 to 16.9% in Fiscal 2006. A more profitable mix of original equipment and aftermarket sales contributed to 2.1 percentage points of the increase. Product development, selling and administrative expenses were up approximately $17.1 million in Fiscal 2006, but were down 0.4 percentage points in comparison to net sales year over year. Product Development, Selling and Administrative Expense Product development, selling and administrative expense for Fiscal 2006 was $321.8 million as compared to $297.9 million for Fiscal 2005. The increase in product development, selling and administrative expense was due primarily to a $11.3 million increase in pension expense and $12.1 million increase in selling expenses related to increased business activity and general inflation, offset by $11.2 million decrease in legal expense associated with an arbitration award and associated legal fees incurred in Fiscal 2005. Interest Expense Interest expense for Fiscal 2006 decreased to $5.7 million as compared to $15.2 million for Fiscal 2005. This decrease was principally due to our repurchase of substantially all of our 8.75% Senior Subordinated Notes in June 2005 offset by direct borrowings during the second half of Fiscal 2006 under our revolving credit agreement. The direct borrowings under our revolving credit agreement were used to finance our common stock repurchase program and our fourth quarter acquisition of the Stamler business. Cash interest paid in Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal 2005 was $4.7 million and $16.5 million, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes Our consolidated effective income tax rates from continuing operations for Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal 2005 were 7.9% and 35.4%, respectively. Consolidated income tax expense from continuing operations decreased to $35.5 million in Fiscal 2006 as compared to $80.5 million in Fiscal 2005. The main drivers of the variance in effective tax rates and income tax expense were the reversal of certain U.S. and Australian valuation reserves, Subpart F earnings, U.S. State income taxes, increased global profitability and mix of earnings year over year and differences in local statutory tax rates. Page 24 A review of income tax valuation reserves was performed as part of the analysis of the Fiscal 2006 income tax provision and a tax benefit of $110.4 million was recorded relating to the reversal of certain valuation reserves, principally of $95.6 million applicable to U.S. deferred income tax assets and $12.5 million related to certain valuation reserves applicable to our Australian consolidated tax group. 2005 Compared with 2004 Sales The following table sets forth Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004 net sales as derived from our Consolidated Statement of Income: Fiscal Fiscal $ % In thousands 2005 2004 Change Change Net Sales Underground Mining Machinery $ 1,132,334 $ 820,121 $ 312,213 38.1% Surface Mining Equipment 795,140 579,236 215,904 37.3% Total $ 1,927,474 $ 1,399,357 $ 528,117 37.7% Total net sales for Fiscal 2005 increased by $528.1 million, or 37.7%, over Fiscal 2004 net sales. Net sales in the United States increased by $230.4 million, or 36.0%, and international net sales rose by $297.7 million, or 39.2%. Reflecting the cyclical upturn in commodities, original equipment revenues increased by approximately 65% to $716.8 million in Fiscal 2005, accounting for 37.2% of total revenues for the year. Aftermarket sales, which include sales of parts and services, increased approximately 26% to $1,210.7 million for Fiscal 2005. The increase in net sales for Underground Mining Machinery in Fiscal 2005 compared to Fiscal 2004 was the result of a $188.5 million increase in shipments of original equipment combined with a $123.7 million increase in aftermarket products and service. The primary increases in original equipment sales were $77.3 million, $67.1 million and $43.3 million in the emerging markets served out of the United Kingdom, the United States and Australia, respectively. The increase in original equipment sales reflects the continuing strong activity levels for new equipment for both replacement of existing equipment and for new mining capacity. Increases in aftermarket net sales were reported in substantially all of our markets. Higher aftermarket sales in the United States accounted for approximately 60% of the overall increase in aftermarket sales. Approximately 40% of the increase in aftermarket sales was due to the increase in repair parts sales, another 40% due to complete machine rebuilds and the remaining increase was due to component repairs. The strong level of aftermarket sales in Fiscal 2005 reflected the continued high level of coal mining activity on a global basis. The increase in net sales for Surface Mining Equipment in Fiscal 2005 compared to Fiscal 2004 was the result of a $90.7 million increase in original equipment combined with a $125.2 million increase in aftermarket parts and service. Increases in original equipment sales were reported in Canada, Mexico, Russia, Australia, Venezuela and Chile. Approximately 40% of the original equipment sales increase was due to shipments of electric mining shovels to Canada and approximately 20% was due primarily to shipments of electric mining shovels to Russia, with the remainder attributable to the other markets. Increases in aftermarket sales were reported for nearly all of our markets. Approximately 73% of the aftermarket sales increase was due to the higher repair parts sales, with the remaining increase due to higher aftermarket service sales. The strong level of both original equipment and aftermarket sales in Fiscal 2005 reflects the continued high level of activity in the mining of copper, coal, iron ore, oil sands and gold. Page 25 Operating Income The following table sets forth Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004 operating income as derived from our Consolidated Statement of Income: Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Operating % Operating % In thousands Income (loss) of Net Sales Income (loss) of Net Sales Operating income (loss): Underground Mining Machinery $ 187,288 16.5% $ 91,376 11.1% Surface Mining Equipment 114,375 14.4% 53,354 9.2% Corporate Expense (34,973) (36,884) Total $ 266,690 13.8% $ 107,846 7.7% Operating income as a percentage of net sales for Underground Mining Machinery increased from 11.1% in Fiscal 2004 to 16.5% in Fiscal 2005. The higher volume of sales favorably impacted operating income in Fiscal 2005. Increased production activity allowed for higher levels of manufacturing overhead absorption that exceeded the increase in the variable overhead spending in the United States, United Kingdom and Australia. Product development and selling expenses were essentially flat year over year, and were down significantly as a percent of revenues. These favorable impacts were partially offset by $10.5 million in administrative expenses primarily related to an increase in legal expense associated with an arbitration award and associated legal fees and compensation expense related to performance based incentives. Operating income as a percentage of net sales for Surface Mining Equipment increased from 9.2% in Fiscal 2004 to 14.4% in Fiscal 2005. This improvement in profitability was due primarily to an $8.7 million improvement in the relationship between manufacturing overhead spending and manufacturing overhead absorption, partially offset by a $15.0 million increase in product development, selling and administrative expenses. Product Development, Selling and Administrative Expense Product development, selling and administrative expense for Fiscal 2005 was $297.9 million as compared to $273.0 million for Fiscal 2004. The increase in product development, selling and administrative expense was due primarily to a $4.2 million increase in compensation expense associated with performance based incentive programs, approximately $4.4 million for an arbitration award and approximately $2.6 million for the implementation of the SAP enterprise software system, as well as the impact of general cost inflation. Product development, selling and administrative expense as a percentage of sales for Fiscal 2005 decreased to 15.5% as compared to 19.5% in Fiscal 2004. Interest Expense Interest expense for Fiscal 2005 decreased to $15.2 million as compared to $24.3 million for Fiscal 2004. This decrease was principally due to our repurchase of substantially all of our 8.75% Senior Subordinated Notes in June 2005. There were no direct borrowings under our revolving credit agreement at the end of Fiscal 2005. Cash interest paid in Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004 was $16.5 million and $22.0 million, respectively. Page 26 Provision for Income Taxes Our effective consolidated income tax rates from continuing operations for Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004 were approximately 35.4% and 41.5%, respectively. For Fiscal 2005, the consolidated income tax rate approximated the statutory rate of 35%. Consolidated income tax expense from continuing operations increased to $80.5 million in Fiscal 2005 as compared to $39.3 million in Fiscal 2004. The increase in income tax expense is primarily attributable to the substantial increase in our pre tax income. Additionally, the consolidated income tax expense and effective income tax rate for Fiscal 2004 were negatively impacted by a $13.4 million increase in our deferred tax valuation reserves relating to Australian corporate income taxes that was not repeated in Fiscal 2005. Reorganization Items Reorganization items include income, expenses and losses that were realized or incurred by the Predecessor Company as a result of its decision to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Net reorganization items for Fiscal 2006, Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004 consisted of the following: Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal In thousands (income) expense 2006 2005 2004 Professional fees reimbursement $ $ (1,500) $ Legal reserve reversal (1,422) Beloit U.K. claim settlement (7,042) (1,092) (1,774) Professional fees directly related to the reorganization 220 826 1,165 Distribution from the Beloit Liquidating Trust (2,856) Beloit Liquidating Trust settlement (2,336) Other net 378 (1,041) Net reorganization income $ (6,822) $ (2,810) $ (6,842) Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to bad debts, excess inventory, warranty, intangible assets, income taxes, performance based incentive programs and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the accounting policies described below are the ones that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments, and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results of operations: Revenue Recognition We generally recognize revenue at the time of shipment and passage of title for sales of products and at the time of performance for sales of services. We recognize revenue on long term contracts, such as the manufacture of mining shovels, drills, draglines and roof support systems, using either the percentage of completion or inventory sales methods. When using the percentage of completion method, sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion. Sales and Page 27 gross profit are adjusted prospectively for revisions in estimated total contract costs and contract values. Estimated losses are recognized in full when identified. We have life cycle management contracts with customers to supply parts and service for terms of 1 to 13 years. These contracts are set up based on the projected costs and revenues of servicing the respective machines over the specified contract terms. Accounting for these contracts requires us to make various estimates, including estimates of the relevant machines long term maintenance requirements. Under these contracts, customers are generally billed monthly and the respective deferred revenues are recorded when billed. Revenue is recognized in the period in which parts are supplied or services provided. These contracts are reviewed periodically and revenue recognition is adjusted appropriately for future estimated costs. If a loss is expected at any time, the full amount of the loss is recognized immediately. Revenue recognition involves judgments, assessments of expected returns, the likelihood of nonpayment, and estimates of expected costs and profits on long term contracts. We analyze various factors, including a review of specific transactions, historical experience, credit worthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions, in determining when to recognize revenue. Changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized with a resulting impact on the timing and amount of associated income. Inventories Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first in, first out (FIFO) method for all inventories. We evaluate the need to record adjustments for inventory on a regular basis. Our policy is to evaluate all inventory including raw material, work in process, finished goods, and spare parts. Inventory in excess of our estimated usage requirements is written down to its estimated net realizable value. Inherent in the estimates of net realizable value are estimates related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of potentially excess inventory. Intangible Assets Intangible assets include drawings, patents, trademarks, technology and other specifically identifiable assets. Indefinite lived intangible assets are not being amortized. Finite lived intangible assets are amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed which is principally the straight line method. Intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes occur that suggest impairment in carrying value. Accrued Warranties We record accruals for potential warranty claims based on prior claim experience. Warranty costs are accrued at the time revenue is recognized. These warranty costs are based upon managements assessment of past claims and current experience. However, actual claims could be higher or lower than amounts estimated, as the amount and value of warranty claims are subject to variation as a result of many factors that cannot be predicted with certainty. Pension and Postretirement Benefits and Costs We have pension and postretirement benefits and expenses which are developed from actuarial valuations. These valuations are based on assumptions including, among other things, discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, retirement ages, years of service, future salary increases, and future health care cost trend rates. Future changes affecting the assumptions will change the related pension benefit or expense. Income Taxes Deferred taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using statutory tax rates. Deferred income tax provisions are based on changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities from period to period, adjusted for certain reclassifications under fresh start accounting. Additionally, Page 28 we analyze our ability to recognize currently the net deferred tax assets created in each jurisdiction in which we operate to determine if valuation allowances are necessary because realizability of the tax assets is deemed to not be more likely than not. As required under the application of fresh start accounting, the release of pre emergence tax valuation reserves was not recorded in the income statement but instead was treated first as a reduction of excess reorganization value until exhausted, then intangibles until exhausted, and thereafter reported as additional paid in capital. Consequently, a net tax charge will be incurred in future years when these tax assets are utilized. We will continue to monitor the appropriateness of the existing valuation allowances and determine annually the amount of valuation allowances that are required to be maintained. Similar to the treatment of pre emergence deferred tax valuation reserves, amounts reserved pre emergence relating to future income tax contingencies also require special treatment under fresh start accounting. Reversals of tax contingency reserves that are no longer required due to the resolution of the underlying tax issue and were recorded at the emergence date will first reduce any excess reorganization value until exhausted, then other intangibles until exhausted, and thereafter are reported as an adjustment to income tax expense. Consistent with prior years, we have reviewed the amounts so reserved and adjusted the balances to the amounts deemed appropriate with the corresponding adjustment reported as an income tax benefit. We estimate the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year during the course of the year on an interim basis. The estimated effective tax rate contemplates the expected jurisdiction where income is earned (e.g. United States compared to non United States) as well as tax planning strategies. If the actual results are different from these estimates, adjustments to the effective tax rate may be required in the period such determination is made. Additionally, discreet items are treated separately from the effective rate analysis and are recorded separately as an income tax provision or benefit at the time they are recognized. To the extent recognized, these items will impact the effective tax rate in aggregate but will not adjust the amount used for future periods within the same fiscal year. Liquidity and Capital Resources Working capital and cash flow are two financial measurements that provide an indication of our ability to meet our financial obligations. We currently use a combination of cash generated by operations and borrowings on our line of credit to fund continuing operations. The following table summarizes the major elements of our working capital at the end of Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal 2005: October 28, October 29, In millions 2006 2005 Cash and cash equivalents $ 101.3 $ 143.9 Accounts receivable 431.4 351.5 Inventories 639.9 548.2 Other current assets 55.3 73.1 Short term debt (5.2) (1.0) Accounts payable (200.1) (160.6) Employee compensation and benefits (77.4) (91.1) Advance payments and progress billings (186.6) (187.7) Accrued warranties (38.9) (34.2) Other current liabilities (91.8) (124.9) Working Capital $ 627.9 $ 517.2 Page 29 Our businesses are working capital intensive and require funding for purchases of production and replacement parts inventories. The primary drivers of our working capital increase are inventory and accounts receivable, which was due to the continued strong growth of both our businesses. In addition, cash is required for capital expenditures for the repair, replacement and upgrading of existing facilities. We have debt service requirements, including commitment and letter of credit fees under our revolving credit facility. We believe that cash generated from operations, together with borrowings available under our credit facility, provides us with adequate liquidity to meet our operating and debt service requirements and planned capital expenditures. In response to continued worldwide demand for mining equipment, we have committed to make investments in both our surface and underground mining operations. The surface mining business has committed to a $16.6 million investment in Milwaukee. The additional investment is expected to increase shovel capacity production by 40%. The underground mining business is focusing its growth in China and Poland. The Baotou facility which already functions as a service center for the underground business, is expanding by approximately 30,000 square feet, to provide expanded repair and rebuild capacity. The Tianjin facility, with a planned current investment of approximately $3.0 million, will carry out manufacturing for both original equipment and spare parts for use worldwide and is expected to be completed by early Fiscal 2007. The facility in Poland will be a combined service center and manufacturing facility with a planned opening date in late Fiscal 2007. Cash provided by operations for Fiscal 2006 was $330.4 million as compared to $201.3 million provided by operations for Fiscal 2005. The increase in our cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to the increase in net income and the decrease in contributions to our pension plans partially offset by the excess income tax benefit from the exercise of stock options. The adoption of SFAS 123(R) caused a reclassification of the excess income tax benefits from the exercise of stock options from an operating activity inflow to a financing activity inflow. Cash used by investment activities for Fiscal 2006 was $154.8 million as compared to $35.7 million used by investment activities for Fiscal 2005. The primary driver of the increase in the use of cash by investing activities was the acquisition of the Stamler business during the fourth quarter of 2006. The increase in capital expenditures in Fiscal 2006 as compared to Fiscal 2005 of $10.3 million was primarily due to our expansion efforts globally. For Fiscal 2007, we anticipate capital expenditures between $60 million and $65 million, primarily for the upgrade of existing facilities, completion of SAP implementation, and other projects. On July 31, 2006, we completed the acquisition of the net assets of the Stamler mining equipment business from the Oldenburg Group, Inc. for approximately $117 million in cash. Stamler manufactures products used primarily in underground coal mining applications, including feeder breakers, battery haulers, and continuous haulage systems. The Stamler business is in line with our previously stated objective of adding bolt on products and services to our existing businesses. Cash used by financing activities for Fiscal 2006 was $214.4 million as compared to $250.8 million used by financing activities for Fiscal 2005. The cash used by financing activities for Fiscal 2006 primarily consisted of the purchase of treasury stock of $295.5 million offset by the net borrowings under our revolving credit facility. The cash used by financing activities in Fiscal 2005 primarily resulted from the repurchase of approximately $200 million of our 8.75% Senior Subordinated Notes at a cost of $224.5 million. During Fiscal 2005, we contributed $60.2 million to our worldwide pension plans compared to $95.4 million during Fiscal 2004. As a result of the additional contributions in Fiscal 2005, no contributions to the U.S. plans was required in Fiscal 2006. We also do not expect any required contributions in Fiscal 2007. However, we currently believe we will make voluntary contributions for our employee pension plans in the range of $15 million to $20 million in Fiscal 2007, primarily to plans outside of the United States. Beyond Fiscal 2007, the investment performance of the plans assets and the actual results of the other actuarial assumptions and most importantly, the impact of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) will determine the funding requirements of the pension plans. We do not believe the PPA will have a significant effect on our near term pension contributions. Page 30 Credit Facilities On November 10, 2006, we amended our $400.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (Credit Agreement) to extend the facility through November 10, 2011 and also amend certain financial covenants. The $400 million unsecured credit facility entered into as of October 28, 2005, replaced the previous $275.0 million facility scheduled to expire on October 15, 2008. We recorded a pre tax charge of $3.3 million related to deferred financing costs associated with the $275.0 million facility in Fiscal 2005. Outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest equal to LIBOR plus the applicable margin (.5% to 1.25%) or the Base Rate (defined as the higher of the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%) at our option. We pay a commitment fee ranging from 0.125% to 0.25% on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility based on our credit rating. The Credit Agreement requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants including leverage and interest coverage. On October 28, 2006, we were in compliance with all financial covenants in both the Credit Agreement and amended Credit Agreement. At October 28, 2006, there were $97.0 million outstanding direct borrowings under the Credit Agreement. Outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement, which count toward the $400 million credit limit, totaled $113.9 million. At October 28, 2006, there was $189.1 million available for borrowings under the Credit Agreement. In 2002, we issued $200 million par value 8.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due March 15, 2012. During Fiscal 2005, we purchased approximately all $200.0 million principal amount of Senior Subordinated Notes through a tender offer and in several open market purchases. These transactions, which resulted in a $29.1 million loss on repurchase, consisted of approximately $224.5 million of cash payments and the required write down of unamortized finance costs of $4.6 million. During Fiscal 2006, our credit rating was upgraded by both Standard and Poors and Moodys. Standard and Poors credit rating increased from BB+ to BBB with an outlook of Stable. Moodys credit rating increased from Ba1 to Baa3 with a continued outlook of Stable. These higher credit ratings provide us with greater flexibility to access financing on the open market as our business circumstances justify. In November 2006, we issued $250.0 million of 6% Senior Notes due 2016 and $150.0 million of 6.625% Senior Notes due 2036 with interest on the notes being paid semi annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, starting on May 15, 2007. The notes are guaranteed by each of our current and future subsidiaries that guarantee our debt under the Credit Agreement. Proceeds from these offerings are being used for the repayment of outstanding revolver balances, additional share repurchases and general corporate purposes. Stock Repurchase Program In November 2005, we commenced purchases under our stock repurchase program. Under the program, management was authorized to repurchase up to $300 million in shares in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions over the 24 month period ending May 31, 2007. Due to our continued ability to generate operating cash flow, the board of directors authorized an increase to the authorized amount of repurchases to $1.0 billion and an extension of the program through December 31, 2008. We repurchased approximately $295.5 million of common stock, representing 6,146,752 shares, under the program in Fiscal 2006. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We lease various assets under operating leases. The aggregate payments under operating leases as of October 28, 2006 are disclosed in the table of Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Page 31 below. No significant changes to lease commitments have occurred since October 29, 2005. We have no other off balance sheet arrangements. We sponsor pension and other post retirement benefit plans for certain employees. See notes 10 and 11 under Item 8 of this annual report for information regarding these plans. Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of October 28, 2006: Less than 1 3 3 5 More than In thousands Total 1 year years years 5 years Long Term Debt $ 97,048 $ $ $ $ 97,048 Capital Lease Obligations 1,471 374 576 429 92 Purchase Obligations 14,415 8,970 5,445 Operating Leases 39,591 12,718 15,285 3,942 7,646 Total $ 152,525 $ 22,062 $ 21,306 $ 4,371 $ 104,786 Market Conditions and Outlook The outlook for the majority of our customers markets remains strong as increasing demand for coal, copper and iron ore reflects global economic growth. The development of Chinas industrial complex and related infrastructure continues at a rapid pace. As the demand for commodities continues to increase in China, the modernization of the mining industry to high productivity equipment is expected to follow. Copper prices have recently seen some pullback but continue to be well above production costs, and iron ore prices are expected to increase further in Fiscal 2007. New copper developments continue to be announced and put into production, mainly due to inventories remaining at historically low levels. Current oil prices continue to support additional developments in the oil sands of Canada. All of these factors combine to support the companys belief that global demand for mining equipment and aftermarket services could continue to grow for an extended duration. One exception is the temporary softness in U.S. coal. A number of our U.S. coal customers have announced either production curtailments, or the deferral of previously planned production increases. As a result, Joy Minings fourth quarter new orders from U.S. underground coal customers declined by nearly one third from a year ago. We see no evidence of an improvement going into early Fiscal 2007. The softness in this market has been largely weather related and as such it is difficult to forecast an eventual upturn. However, the long term supply and demand situation for coal in the U.S. is favorable, based on the announcements for new coal fired power plants, the age of existing coal mines, the accelerated retrofitting of existing plants with scrubbers, and a variety of new coal technology projects. Market conditions in the other commodity markets served by our customers are strong. This is reflected in worldwide underground coal markets producing a double digit increase in total quarterly orders, before inclusion of orders from the Stamler acquisition and despite the significant fall off in orders from the U.S. In surface mining markets, orders for mining shovels were very strong in the fourth quarter with orders being received in each of copper, iron ore, oil sands and non U.S. coal industries. New Accounting Pronouncements Our new accounting pronouncements are set forth under Item 8 of this annual report and are incorporated herein by reference. Page 32 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Volatility in interest rates and foreign exchange rates can impact our earnings, equity and cash flow. From time to time we undertake transactions to hedge this impact. Under governing accounting guidelines, a hedge instrument is considered effective if it offsets partially or completely the impact on earnings, equity and cash flow due to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. In accordance with our policy, we do not execute derivatives that are speculative or that increase our risk from interest rate or foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long term debt obligations. We manage this risk through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate debt (See Note 4 Borrowings and Credit Facilities). At October 28, 2006 we were not party to any interest rate derivative contracts. Foreign Currency Risk Most of our foreign subsidiaries use local currencies as their functional currency. For consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities are translated at month end exchange rates. Items of income and expense are translated at average exchange rates. Translation gains and losses are not included in determining net income (loss) but are accumulated as a separate component of shareholders equity. Gains (losses) arising from foreign currency transactions are included in determining net income (loss). During Fiscal 2006, we incurred a gain of $0.1 million arising from foreign currency transactions. Foreign exchange derivatives at October 28, 2006 were in the form of forward exchange contracts executed over the counter. There is a concentration of these contracts held with LaSalle Bank, N.A. as agent for ABN Amro Bank, N.V. which maintains an investment grade rating. We have adopted a Foreign Exchange Risk Management Policy. It is a risk averse policy under which significant exposures that impact earnings and cash flows are fully hedged. Exposures that impact only equity or do not have a cash flow impact are generally not hedged with derivatives. There are two categories of foreign exchange exposures that are hedged: assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency, which include net investment in a foreign subsidiary, and future committed receipts or payments denominated in a foreign currency. These exposures normally arise from imports and exports of goods and from intercompany trade and lending activity. The fair value of our forward exchange contracts at October 28, 2006 is analyzed in the following table of dollar equivalent terms: In thousands of US Dollars Maturing in 2007 Buy Sell U.S. Dollar $
