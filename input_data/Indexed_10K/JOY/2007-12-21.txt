Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes. References made to years are for fiscal year periods. Dollar amounts are in thousands, except share and per share data and as indicated. The purpose of this discussion and analysis is to enhance the understanding and evaluation of the results of operations, financial position, cash flows, indebtedness, and other key financial information of Joy Global Inc. and its subsidiaries for fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006, and fiscal 2005. For a more complete understanding of this discussion, please read the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. Overview We are the direct successor to businesses that have been manufacturing mining equipment for over 120 years. We operate in two business segments: Underground Mining Machinery, comprised of our Joy Mining Machinery business (Joy), and Surface Mining Equipment, comprised of our P&H Mining Equipment business (P&H). Joy is the worlds largest producer of high productivity underground mining equipment used primarily for the extraction of coal. P&H is the worlds largest producer of high productivity electric mining shovels and a leading producer of walking draglines and large rotary blasthole drills, used primarily for surface mining copper, coal, iron ore, oil sands, and other minerals. In addition to selling new equipment, we provide parts, components, repairs, rebuilds, diagnostic analysis, fabrication, training, and other aftermarket services for our installed base of machines. In the case of Surface Mining Equipment, we also provide aftermarket services for equipment manufactured by other companies, including manufacturers with which we have ongoing relationships and which we refer to as Alliance Partners. We emphasize our aftermarket products and services as an integral part of lowering our customers cost per unit of production and are focused on continuing to grow this part of our business. Demand for new equipment is cyclical in nature, being driven by commodity prices and other factors. Original equipment sales have ranged from $316.4 million in fiscal 2001 to $947.5 million in fiscal 2007. Our aftermarket business has shown more consistent growth since fiscal 2001 with sales ranging from $799.8 million in 2001 to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2007. Along with record revenues in fiscal 2007, our backlog has also continued to grow. Our backlog of $1.3 billion as of October 28, 2006 increased to $1.6 billion as of October 26, 2007 driven by increased original equipment orders for expansion projects as well as aftermarket products and services to support the high utilization of the current installed fleet. The continued strength and positive long term outlook of commodity markets, including those for copper, iron ore, oil sands, and international coal, support sustained demand for our original equipment and aftermarket services. Sustained demand for our equipment and aftermarket services globally has led to further expansion plans in fiscal 2007. Consistent with our plan to expand manufacturing in low cost regions of the world, the surface mining business broke ground on a facility in Tianjin, China which will expand our proprietary component machining capabilities. The surface mining business also continued to expand its presence and capabilities at mine sites through field service extensions in the southwest region of the United States and in Australia. The underground mining business continues to make significant investments in China, with the newly constructed manufacturing facility in Tianjin producing its first set of armored face conveyor pan lines. The underground business also expanded its manufacturing and service center capabilities with the completion of a facility in Poland. Fiscal 2007 continues to support a prolonged commodity growth cycle. Global commodities have continued to show strength, and the global economy is looking to maintain 4% to 5% growth, led by China and India with expected growth of 8% to 10%, respectively. International coal, copper, iron ore, and oil sands continue to trade near historical highs and as a result continued investment in new projects is needed to support global demand. The U.S. underground coal market has started to show early signs of recovery, but will continue to be impacted by current and future energy regulations. Page 23 Approximately 85% of our sales in fiscal 2007 were recorded at the time of shipment of the product or delivery of the service. The remaining 15% of sales was recorded using percentage of completion accounting, a practice we follow in recognizing revenue on the sale of long lead time equipment such as electric mining shovels, walking draglines and powered roof support systems. Under percentage of completion accounting, revenue is recognized on firm orders from customers as the product is manufactured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to estimated total costs to be incurred. We generally receive progress payments on long lead time equipment. Operating results of fiscal 2007 were indicative of the volatility associated with the commodity markets. Net sales for fiscal 2007 totaled $2.5 billion, compared with $2.4 billion in fiscal 2006. The acquisition of Stamler in the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 added $84.3 million in fiscal 2007 and the continued strength of all surface markets added $148.7 million, while U.S. underground activity partially offset this increase by $116 million. Our gross profit margin in fiscal 2007 increased to 32.5% from 31.4% in fiscal 2006 due to the continued strength of commodity markets, a heavier mix of aftermarket products and services and disciplined cost control. Operating income totaled $473 million in fiscal 2007, up $30.9 million from fiscal 2006. The increase in operating income was the result of increased sales related to strong international demand and the inclusion of Stamler in the full year, offset by increased warranty costs of $15.0 million, increased costs of $8.2 million associated with the Stamler acquisition, and costs of $5.9 million associated with our continuing investment in China. Net income was $279.8 million, or $2.51 per diluted share in fiscal 2007 compared with $416.4 million or $3.38 per diluted share in the prior year. Net income in the prior year was benefited from a reversal of certain deferred tax asset valuation allowances of $110 million. Reorganization income also benefited the prior year by $7.0 million related to a settled claim by a former subsidiary. Results of Operations 2007 Compared with 2006 Sales The following table sets forth fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 net sales as derived from our Consolidated Statement of Income: Fiscal Fiscal $ % In thousands 2007 2006 Change Change Net Sales Underground Mining Machinery $ 1,421,715 $ 1,424,803 $ (3,088) Surface Mining Equipment 1,125,607 976,907 148,700 15.2% Total $ 2,547,322 $ 2,401,710 $ 145,612 6.1% The slight decrease in net sales for Underground Mining Machinery in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 was the result of a $41.8 million decrease in original equipment combined with a $38.7 million increase in aftermarket products and service. Weakness in the Central Appalachia region of the United States resulted in a decrease across substantially all original equipment product lines. Chinas original equipment sales also decreased primarily due to lower armored face conveyor and powered roof support sales and on more local competition. Offsetting the impact of the United States and China, increased original equipment sales were reported in Australia and associated with Stamler. International aftermarket sales increased in South Africa and China reflecting continued high level of coal mining activity on a global basis. The increase in net sales for Surface Mining Equipment in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 was the result of a $51.6 million increase in original equipment combined with a $97.1 million increase in aftermarket parts and service. Increases in original equipment sales due to timing of production schedules primarily consisted of increased shovel revenue in two key markets, the Canadian oil sands and China. Aftermarket sales increases were primarily Page 24 due to $13.7 million in emerging markets and $86.6 million in the United States and most notably in the southwest region of the United States. The emerging market increase is primarily related to continued strength of coal markets in China and Russia, while the southwest increase was due to the continued global demand for copper. Operating Income The following table sets forth fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 operating income as derived from our Consolidated Statement of Income: Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Operating % Operating % In thousands Income (loss) of Net Sales Income (loss) of Net Sales Operating income (loss): Underground Mining Machinery $ 285,860 20.1% $ 307,404 21.6% Surface Mining Equipment 217,825 19.4% 165,125 16.9% Corporate Expense (30,410) (30,132) Total $ 473,275 18.6% $ 442,397 18.4% Operating income as a percentage of net sales for Underground Mining Machinery decreased to 20.1% in fiscal 2007 from 21.6% in fiscal 2006. The decrease in operating income was principally due to increased warranty expense of $10.0 million and increased product development, selling and administrative expense of $32.8 million offset by a greater mix of higher margin aftermarket sales and decreased incentive compensation expense. The increase in product development, selling and administrative expense was related to international infrastructure development, the inclusion of Stamler for all of fiscal 2007, and increased pension expense. Operating income as a percentage of net sales for Surface Mining Equipment increased to 19.4% in fiscal 2007 from 16.9% in fiscal 2006. The increase in operating income was principally due to increased sales volume of $40.6 million and a more profitable mix of original equipment and aftermarket sales. Product development, selling and administrative expenses were up approximately $4.0 million in fiscal 2007, but were down 1.1 percentage points in comparison to net sales year over year. Product Development, Selling and Administrative Expense Product development, selling and administrative expense for fiscal 2007 was $358.5 million as compared to $321.8 million for fiscal 2006. The increase in product development, selling and administrative expense was primarily due to $15.0 million of increased warranty costs, $9.7 million of costs related to the development and expansion of global infrastructure, $8.2 million of expenses related to the inclusion of Stamler for all of fiscal 2007, $6.3 million of foreign exchange impact, $3.3 million increase in pension expense, and general inflation. This increase was offset by a $7.2 million decrease in incentive based compensation expense. Interest Expense Interest expense for fiscal 2007 was $31.9 million as compared to $5.7 million for fiscal 2006. The $26.2 million increase was principally due to the November 2006 issuance of $250.0 million of 6% Senior Notes due 2016 and $150.0 million of 6.625% Senior Notes due 2036. The proceeds from the notes were primarily used to finance our common stock repurchase program and to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit agreement. Reorganization Items Reorganization items include income and expenses that were realized or incurred as a result of our 2001 reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Fiscal 2007 reorganization related items included the resolution of a contingent payable of $1.5 million partially offset by continuing professional fees related to the Page 25 reorganization of $0.8 million. Fiscal 2006 reorganization items included $7.0 million of income related to a Beloit claim settlement. Provision for Income Taxes Our consolidated effective income tax rates from continuing operations for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 were approximately 37.7% and 7.9%, respectively. Consolidated income tax expense from continuing operations increased to $169.3 million in fiscal 2007 as compared to $35.5 million in fiscal 2006. The main drivers of the variance in tax rates and income tax expense were U.S. Subpart F earnings, U.S. State income taxes, mix of earnings year over year, differences in local statutory tax rates and the reversal of certain U.S. and Australian deferred income tax valuation reserves in fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2007 also included tax adjustments of $18.0 million which included taxes on dividends received from foreign subsidiaries during the quarter not previously forecasted, the resolution of an R&D study which resulted in the write off of pre bankruptcy R&D credits, and a reserve added following the quarterly evaluation of a previously disclosed contingent tax liability in South Africa. A review of income tax valuation reserves was performed throughout fiscal 2007 as part of the overall income tax provision and a net benefit of $1.3 million was recorded on a global basis. For fiscal 2006, a tax benefit of $110.4 million was recorded relating to the reversal of certain valuation reserves, principally $95.6 million applicable to U.S. deferred income tax assets and $12.5 million related to certain deferred income tax assets applicable to our Australian consolidated tax group. 2006 Compared with 2005 Sales The following table sets forth fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 net sales as derived from our Consolidated Statement of Income: Fiscal Fiscal $ % In thousands 2006 2005 Change Change Net Sales Underground Mining Machinery $ 1,424,803 $ 1,132,334 $ 292,469 25.8% Surface Mining Equipment 976,907 795,140 181,767 22.9% Total $ 2,401,710 $ 1,927,474 $ 474,236 24.6% Total net sales for fiscal 2006 increased by $474.2 million, or 24.6%, over fiscal 2005 net sales. The increase in net sales for Underground Mining Machinery in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was the result of a $151.5 million increase in shipments of original equipment combined with a $141.0 million increase in aftermarket products and service. With the exception of roof supports sales, which were flat with fiscal 2005, increases in original equipment sales were reported across all original equipment product lines. The United States represented $117.4 million of the increase in original equipment sales. Increases in aftermarket net sales were reported in all of our markets. Aftermarket sales increases ranging from approximately 12% in the United States to approximately 34% in emerging markets served out of the United Kingdom reflected the high level of coal mining activity on a global basis and more specifically, from our international markets. The increase in net sales for Surface Mining Equipment in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was the result of a $69.5 million increase in original equipment combined with a $112.2 million increase in aftermarket parts and service. Increases in original equipment sales were reported in the United States, Australia, Chile, Venezuela, South Africa, and China offset by decreased equipment sales in Canada and Mexico. Almost two thirds of the original equipment increase related to electric mining shovels. Increases in aftermarket sales were reported for all of our Page 26 significant markets. Aftermarket sales increases ranging from approximately 19% in South Africa to approximately 50% in Canada reflected the high level of copper, coal mining, and iron ore mining activity on a global basis and the high level of oil sands mining activity in Canada. Operating Income The following table sets forth fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 operating income as derived from our Consolidated Statement of Income: Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Operating % Operating % In thousands Income (loss) of Net Sales Income (loss) of Net Sales Operating income (loss): Underground Mining Machinery $ 307,404 21.6% $ 187,288 16.5% Surface Mining Equipment 165,125 16.9% 114,375 14.4% Corporate Expense (30,132) (34,973) Total $ 442,397 18.4% $ 266,690 13.8% Operating income as a percentage of net sales for Underground Mining Machinery increased from 16.5% in fiscal 2005 to 21.6% in fiscal 2006. A more profitable mix of original equipment sales accounted for 2.3 percentage points of the change. Product development, selling and administrative expenses were up approximately $11.7 million in fiscal 2006, but were down 2.3 percentage points in comparison to net sales year over year. Operating income as a percentage of net sales for Surface Mining Equipment increased from 14.4% in fiscal 2005 to 16.9% in fiscal 2006. A more profitable mix of original equipment and aftermarket sales contributed to 2.1 percentage points of the increase. Product development, selling and administrative expenses were up approximately $17.1 million in fiscal 2006, but were down 0.4 percentage points in comparison to net sales year over year. Product Development, Selling and Administrative Expense Product development, selling and administrative expense for fiscal 2006 was $321.8 million as compared to $297.9 million for fiscal 2005. The increase in product development, selling and administrative expense was due primarily to a $11.3 million increase in pension expense and $12.1 million increase in selling expenses related to increased business activity and general inflation, offset by $11.2 million decrease in legal expense associated with an arbitration award and associated legal fees incurred in fiscal 2005. Interest Expense Interest expense for fiscal 2006 decreased to $5.7 million as compared to $15.2 million for fiscal 2005. This decrease was principally due to our repurchase of substantially all of our 8.75% Senior Subordinated Notes in June 2005 offset by direct borrowings during the second half of fiscal 2006 under our revolving credit agreement. The direct borrowings under our revolving credit agreement were used to finance our common stock repurchase program and our fourth quarter acquisition of the Stamler business. Cash interest paid in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 was $4.7 million and $16.5 million, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes Our consolidated effective income tax rates from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 were 7.9% and 35.4%, respectively. Consolidated income tax expense from continuing operations decreased to $35.5 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to $80.5 million in fiscal 2005. The main drivers of the variance in effective tax Page 27 rates and income tax expense were the reversal of certain U.S. and Australian deferred tax asset valuation reserves, Subpart F earnings, U.S. State income taxes, increased global profitability and mix of earnings year over year and differences in local statutory tax rates. Reorganization Items Reorganization items include income, expenses, and losses that were realized or incurred by the Predecessor Company as a result of its decision to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Net reorganization items for fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006, and fiscal 2005 consisted of the following: Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal In thousands (income) expense 2007 2006 2005 Resolution of contingent payable $ (1,473) $ $ Beloit U.K. claim settlement (7,042) (1,092) Professional fees directly related to the reorganization 745 220 826 Professional fees reimbursement (1,500) Legal reserve reversal (1,422) Other net 378 Net reorganization income $ (728) $ (6,822) $ (2,810) Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to bad debts, excess inventory, warranty, intangible assets, income taxes, and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the accounting policies described below are the ones that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments, and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results of operations. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize revenue at the time of shipment and passage of title for sales of products and at the time of performance for sales of services. We recognize revenue on long term contracts, such as the manufacture of mining shovels, drills, draglines and roof support systems, using either the percentage of completion or inventory sales methods. When using the percentage of completion method, sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion. Sales and gross profit are adjusted prospectively for revisions in estimated total contract costs and contract values. Estimated losses are recognized in full when identified. We have life cycle management contracts with customers to supply parts and service for terms of 1 to 13 years. These contracts are set up based on the projected costs and revenues of servicing the respective machines over the specified contract terms. Accounting for these contracts requires us to make various estimates, including estimates of the relevant machines long term maintenance requirements. Under these contracts, customers are generally billed monthly and the respective deferred revenues are recorded when billed. Revenue is recognized in the period in which parts are supplied or services provided. These contracts are reviewed periodically and revenue recognition Page 28 is adjusted appropriately for future estimated costs. If a loss is expected at any time, the full amount of the loss is recognized immediately. In limited circumstances, we have customer agreements that are multiple element arrangements as defined by the Financial Accounting Standards Board Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. The agreements are considered for multiple elements based on the following criteria: the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis, there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item and the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item, and delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor. Revenue is then allocated to each identified unit of accounting based on our estimate of their relative fair values. Revenue recognition involves judgments, assessments of expected returns, the likelihood of nonpayment, and estimates of expected costs and profits on long term contracts. We analyze various factors, including a review of specific transactions, historical experience, credit worthiness of customers, and current market and economic conditions, in determining when to recognize revenue. Changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized with a resulting impact on the timing and amount of associated income. Inventories Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first in, first out (FIFO) method for all inventories. We evaluate the need to record adjustments for inventory on a regular basis. Our policy is to evaluate all inventories including raw material, work in process, finished goods, and spare parts. Inventory in excess of our estimated usage requirements is written down to its estimated net realizable value. Inherent in the estimates of net realizable value are estimates related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, possible alternative uses, and ultimate realization of potentially excess inventory. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Intangible assets include drawings, patents, trademarks, technology, customer relationships and other specifically identifiable assets. Indefinite lived intangible assets are not being amortized. These assets are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes occur that suggest impairment in carrying value. Finite lived intangible assets are amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed, which is principally the straight line method. Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes occur that suggest impairment in carrying value. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is tested for impairment using the two step approach, in accordance with Statement on Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142). Goodwill is assigned to specific reporting units and tested for impairment at least annually, during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that a reporting units carrying amount is greater than its fair value. Management judgment is used in the development of assumptions in the impairment testing process, including growth and discount rate assumptions. We performed our goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and no impairment was identified. Accrued Warranties We record accruals for potential warranty claims based on prior claim experience. Warranty costs are accrued at the time revenue is recognized. These warranty costs are based upon managements assessment of past claims and current experience. However, actual claims could be higher or lower than amounts estimated, as the amount and value of warranty claims are subject to variation as a result of many factors that cannot be predicted with certainty. Page 29 Pension and Postretirement Benefits and Costs We have pension and postretirement benefits and expenses which are developed from actuarial valuations. These valuations are based on assumptions including, among other things, discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, retirement ages, years of service, future salary increases, and future health care cost trend rates. Future changes affecting the assumptions will change the related pension benefit or expense. As such, a .25% change in the discount rate and rate of return on net assets would have the following effects on projected benefit obligation and pension expense, respectively, as of and for the fiscal year ended October 26, 2007: .25% Increase .25% Decrease Expected Expected Discount long term Discount long term In thousands Rate rate of return Rate rate of return U.S Pension Plans: Net pension expense $ 2,243 $ (1,470) $ (2,234) $ 1,470 Projected benefit obligation 25,947 (25,172) Non U.S. Pension Plans: Net pension expense 1,898 (1,283) (1,886) 1,283 Projected benefit obligation 25,497 (24,484) Other Postretirement Benefit Plans: Net pension expense 55 (56) Projected benefit obligation 1,110 (1,089) Income Taxes Deferred taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using statutory tax rates. Deferred income tax provisions are based on changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities from period to period, adjusted for certain reclassifications under fresh start accounting. Additionally, we analyze our ability to recognize the net deferred tax assets created in each jurisdiction in which we operate to determine if valuation allowances are necessary based on the more likely than not criteria. As required under the application of fresh start accounting, the release of pre emergence tax valuation reserves was not recorded in the income statement but instead was treated first as a reduction of excess reorganization value until exhausted, then intangibles until exhausted, and thereafter reported as additional paid in capital. Consequently, a net tax charge will be incurred in future years when these tax assets are utilized. We will continue to monitor the appropriateness of the existing valuation allowances and determine annually the amount of valuation allowances that are required to be maintained. As of October 26, 2007, there were $72.9 million of valuation allowances against pre emergence net operating loss carryforwards. All future reversals of pre emergence valuation allowances will be reversed to additional paid in capital. Similar to the treatment of pre emergence deferred tax valuation reserves, amounts reserved pre emergence relating to future income tax contingencies also require special treatment under fresh start accounting. Reversals of tax contingency reserves that are no longer required due to the resolution of the underlying tax issue and were recorded at the emergence date will first reduce any excess reorganization value until exhausted, then other intangibles until exhausted, and thereafter are reported as an adjustment to income tax expense. Consistent with prior years, we have reviewed the amounts so reserved and adjusted the balances to the amounts deemed appropriate with the corresponding adjustment reported as an income tax benefit. As of October 26, 2007, there were $1.4 Page 30 million of accrued pre emergence income tax contingencies. Future reversals of pre emergence income tax contingencies will be recognized as a component of income tax expense in the period reversed. We estimate the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year on an interim basis. The estimated effective tax rate contemplates the expected jurisdiction where income is earned (e.g., United States compared to non United States) as well as tax planning strategies. If the actual results are different from these estimates, adjustments to the effective tax rate may be required in the period such determination is made. Additionally, discreet items are treated separately from the effective rate analysis and are recorded separately as an income tax provision or benefit at the time they are recognized. To the extent recognized, these items will impact the effective tax rate in aggregate but will not adjust the amount used for future periods within the same fiscal year. Liquidity and Capital Resources Working capital and cash flow are two financial measurements that provide an indication of our ability to meet our financial obligations. We currently use a combination of cash generated by operations, borrowings on our line of credit and debt offerings to fund continuing operations. The following table summarizes the major elements of our working capital at the end of fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006: October 26, October 28, In millions 2007 2006 Cash and cash equivalents $ 173.2 $ 101.3 Accounts receivable 560.2 431.4 Inventories 727.4 639.9 Other current assets 77.0 55.3 Short term debt (0.2) (5.2) Accounts payable (199.2) (200.1) Employee compensation and benefits (59.5) (77.4) Advance payments and progress billings (324.1) (186.6) Accrued warranties (49.4) (38.9) Other accrued liabilities (121.1) (91.8) Working Capital $ 784.3 $ 627.9 We currently use working capital and cash flow production as two financial measurements to evaluate the performance of our operations and our ability to meet our financial obligations. We continue to require working capital investment to maintain our position as a leading manufacturer and servicer of high productivity mining equipment. The primary drivers of these requirements are funding for purchases of production and replacement parts inventories. Our position as a market leader in providing timely service and repair requires us to maintain a certain level of replacement parts. As part of our continuous improvement of purchasing and manufacturing processes, we continue to strive for alignment of inventory levels with customer demand and current production schedules. We expect fiscal 2008 capital spending to be between 3.5% and 4.0% of sales. This represents an increase from fiscal 2007 capital spending as a percentage of sales of 2%, primarily due to initiatives to increase our manufacturing capacity in emerging markets and to further expand our aftermarket service capabilities. In addition, cash is required for capital expenditures for the repair, replacement, and upgrading of existing facilities. We have debt service requirements, including commitment and letter of credit fees under our revolving credit facility and biannual interest payments due to holders of our Senior Subordinated Notes issued in November 2006. We believe that cash generated from operations, together with borrowings available under our credit facility, Page 31 provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our operating and debt service requirements and planned capital expenditures. In response to continued worldwide demand for mining equipment, we have made and are committed to make additional investments in both our surface and underground mining operations. In fiscal 2007, we completed a previously announced investment in our manufacturing facility in Milwaukee. With this expansion, along with our current outsourcing arrangements, this gives us the capacity to produce 26 shovels a year. Also in fiscal 2007, efforts commenced on a $50 million expansion in proprietary component machining capabilities for P&H Mining at our Tianjin, China campus, with start up being projected in spring 2008, with full production targeted for 2009. The next phase of our expansion will be an approximately 150,000 square foot facility in China and will give us further transmission assembly capabilities. We also continue to expand outsourcing arrangements for certain non proprietary P&H components, such as large fabrications, in areas of the world in which the products are ultimately destined. The underground mining business is also focusing its growth in lower cost regions of the world. The Baotou, China facility has been expanded by approximately 30,000 square feet, to provide increased repair and rebuild capacity. The Tianjin, China facility successfully produced its first set of armored face conveyor panlines for use in China. With this major accomplishment, we are looking to produce panlines for all markets out of the Tianjin facility in fiscal 2008. Continuing with the focus on low cost regions of the world, we completed a 70,000 square foot combined service center and manufacturing facility in Poland in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. As we look to provide more efficient operations amongst our customers and two operating segments, we are the in the process of consolidating six smaller existing facilities in Australia into one combined underground and surface mining service center and manufacturing facility. Cash provided by operations for fiscal 2007 was $382.0 million as compared to $330.4 million provided by operations for fiscal 2006. The increase in our cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to our continued focus on obtaining advance payments for original equipment. The increase in advance payments was offset by further increases in inventory and accounts receivable. Inventory management and forecasting remains a key initiative for us in fiscal 2008. Cash used by investment activities for fiscal 2007 was $62.3 million as compared to $154.8 million used by investment activities for fiscal 2006. The primary driver of the decrease in the use of cash by investing activities was the acquisition of the Stamler business during the fourth quarter of 2006 for $117.4 million. For fiscal 2008, we anticipate capital expenditures between $120 million and $125 million, primarily for the upgrade of existing facilities, machines tools related to the Tianjin facility, completion of SAP implementation, and other projects. On July 31, 2006, we completed the acquisition of the net assets of the Stamler mining equipment business from the Oldenburg Group, Inc. for $117.4 million in cash. Stamler manufactures products used primarily in underground coal mining applications, including feeder breakers, battery haulers, and continuous haulage systems. The Stamler business is in line with our previously stated objective of adding bolt on products and services to our existing businesses. Cash used by financing activities for fiscal 2007 was $255.1 million as compared to $214.4 million used by financing activities for fiscal 2006. The cash used by financing activities for fiscal 2007 primarily consisted of the repurchase of outstanding stock of $499.7 million and the repayment of all amounts outstanding on our revolving credit facility offset by the issuance of $400 million of senior subordinated bonds in early fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2007, we contributed $18.5 million to our worldwide pension plans compared to $14.2 million during fiscal 2006. As a result of additional contributions in prior years, no contributions to qualified U.S. plans were required in fiscal 2007. We do not expect any required contributions to U.S. pension plans in fiscal 2008. While no contributions will be required in 2008, we intend to make contributions to our employee pension plans of approximately $25 million, primarily to plans outside of the United States. Beyond fiscal 2008, the investment performance of the plans assets and the actual results of the other actuarial assumptions and most importantly, the Page 32 impact of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) will determine the funding requirements of the pension plans. We do not believe the PPA will have a significant effect on our near term pension contributions. Credit Facilities On November 10, 2006, we amended our $400.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (Credit Agreement) to extend the facility through November 10, 2011 and also to amend certain financial covenants, including the elimination of covenants restricting stock repurchases and limiting capital expenditures. In fiscal 2005, we recorded a pre tax charge of $3.3 million related to deferred financing costs associated with the prior facility. Outstanding borrowings on the Credit Agreement bear interest equal to LIBOR plus the applicable margin based on our credit rating (0.5% to 1.25%) or the Base Rate (defined as the higher of the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%), at our option. We also pay a commitment fee ranging from 0.125% to 0.25% on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility based on our credit rating. The Credit Agreement requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants including leverage and interest coverage. The Credit Agreement also restricts payments of dividends or other return of capital based on the consolidated leverage ratio. On October 26, 2007, we were in compliance with all financial covenants in the Credit Agreement and had no restriction on the payment of dividends or return of capital. At October 26, 2007, no direct borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement, which count toward the $400 million credit limit, totaled $116.4 million. At October 26, 2007, there was $283.6 million available for borrowings under the Credit Agreement. In November 2006, we issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.0% Senior Notes due 2016 and $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.625% Senior Notes due 2036 (Notes) with interest on the Notes being paid semi annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, starting on May 15, 2007. The Notes are guaranteed by each of our current and future significant domestic subsidiaries (See
