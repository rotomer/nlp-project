Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes. References made to years are for fiscal year periods. Dollar amounts are in thousands, except share and per share data and as indicated. The purpose of this discussion and analysis is to enhance the understanding and evaluation of the results of operations, financial position, cash flows, indebtedness, and other key financial information of Joy Global Inc. and its subsidiaries for fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006. For a more complete understanding of this discussion, please read the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. Overview We are the direct successor to businesses that have been manufacturing mining equipment for almost 125 years. We operate in three business segments: Underground Mining Machinery, comprised of our Joy Mining Machinery business, Surface Mining Equipment, comprised of our P&H Mining Equipment business and Continental Crushing & Conveying. Joy is the worlds largest producer of high productivity underground mining equipment used primarily for the extraction of coal. P&H is the worlds largest producer of high productivity electric mining shovels and a leading producer of walking draglines and large rotary blasthole drills, used primarily for surface mining copper, coal, iron ore, oil sands, and other minerals. CCC is a worldwide leader in breakage equipment and conveyor systems for bulk material handling in mining and industrial applications. In addition to selling new equipment, we provide parts, components, repairs, rebuilds, diagnostic analysis, fabrication, training, and other aftermarket services for our installed base of machines. In the case of Surface Mining Equipment, we also provide aftermarket services for equipment manufactured by other companies, including manufacturers with which we have ongoing relationships and which we refer to as Alliance Partners. We emphasize our aftermarket products and services as an integral part of lowering our customers cost per unit of production and are focused on continuing to grow this part of our business. Original equipment sales have ranged from $316.4 million in fiscal 2001 to $1.4 billion in fiscal 2008. Our aftermarket business has shown more consistent growth since fiscal 2001 with sales ranging from $799.8 million in 2001 to $2.0 billion in fiscal 2008. Along with record revenues in fiscal 2008, our backlog has also continued to grow. Our backlog of $1.6 billion as of October 26, 2007 increased to $3.2 billion as of October 31, 2008 driven by increased original equipment orders for expansion projects as well as aftermarket products and services to support the high utilization of the current installed fleet. Demand for new equipment is cyclical in nature, being driven by commodity prices and other factors. The evolving economic crisis increasingly impacts the outlook for the mining industry. Slowing of the worlds economies is reducing demand for commodities, forcing prices down and limiting mining company cash flows. This combination has created a general downward bias on commodity prices. As a result of this outlook, we expect our customers to become more selective about their next new mine expansion projects, but at the same time expect projects to continue to be approved. Approximately 79% of our sales in fiscal 2008 were recorded at the time of shipment of the product or delivery of the service. The remaining 21% of sales was recorded using percentage of completion accounting, a practice we follow in recognizing revenue on the sale of long lead time equipment such as electric mining shovels, walking draglines, powered roof support systems and conveyor systems. Under percentage of completion accounting, revenue is recognized on firm orders from customers as the product is manufactured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to estimated total costs to be incurred. We generally receive progress payments on long lead time equipment. Operating results of fiscal 2008 were indicative of the strength of the underground coal market in the U.S. and overall strength of surfaced mined commodities, including coal, iron ore, and copper for the most part of fiscal 2008. Net sales for fiscal 2008 totaled $3.4 billion, compared with $2.5 billion in fiscal 2007. The acquisition of Continental in the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2008 added $251.0 million of revenue for the year, the continued strength of all surface markets added $305.9 million and the rebound of the U.S. underground activity Page 25 contributed $314.8 million. Operating income totaled $551.2 million in fiscal 2008, up $77.9 million from fiscal 2007. The increase in operating income was the result of increased sales related to strong demand across all surface and underground markets, offset by increased incentive based compensation expense of $43.5 million and a $22.7 million charge related to a maintenance and repair contract in Australia. Net income was $374.3 million, or $3.45 per diluted share in fiscal 2008 compared with $279.8 million or $2.51 per diluted share in the prior year. Results of Operations 2008 Compared with 2007 Sales The following table sets forth fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 net sales as derived from our Consolidated Statement of Income: Fiscal Fiscal $ % In thousands 2008 2007 Change Change Net Sales Underground Mining Machinery $ 1,736,485 $ 1,421,715 $ 314,770 22.1% Surface Mining Equipment 1,431,466 1,125,607 305,859 27.2% Crushing & Conveying 339,421 Eliminations (88,438) Total $ 3,418,934 $ 2,547,322 $ 871,612 34.2% The increase in net sales for Underground Mining Machinery in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was the result of a $211.3 million increase in original equipment combined with a $103.5 million increase in aftermarket products and service. After a challenging fiscal 2007, the Central Appalachia region of the United States experienced growth across substantially all original equipment product lines. Chinas original equipment sales also increased primarily due to increased armored face conveyor and shearer sales. Increased original equipment sales were reported in Eurasia primarily due to the sale of a powered roof support system in fiscal 2008. United States aftermarket sales increased reflecting continued investment in both existing and greenfield metallurgical and thermal projects. The increase in net sales for Surface Mining Equipment in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was the result of a $142.0 million increase in original equipment combined with a $163.9 million increase in aftermarket parts and service. Increases in original equipment sales due to timing of production schedules primarily consisted of increased shovel revenue in the Canadian oil sands, the United States, Chile and China. As a result of the increasing installed base of electric mining shovels, aftermarket sales increased by $61.3 million in the United States, $60.0 million in Chile and $48.0 million in Canada. The net sales in Crushing & Conveying represented the strength of the crushing equipment and conveying systems and aftermarket parts and services in the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom. Revenue from this segment was included from the February 14, 2008 acquisition date of N.E.S. Investment Co. The eliminations represent the Stamler crushing equipment which is sold through the Underground Mining Machinery and Surface Mining Equipment segments but managed as part of the Crushing & Conveying segment. Page 26 Operating Income The following table sets forth fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 operating income as derived from our Consolidated Statement of Income: Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 Operating % Operating % In thousands Income (loss) of Net Sales Income (loss) of Net Sales Operating income (loss): Underground Mining Machinery $ 348,830 20.1% $ 285,860 20.1% Surface Mining Equipment 227,382 15.9% 217,825 19.4% Crushing & Conveying 27,856 8.2% Corporate Expense (34,759) (30,410) Eliminations (18,105) Total $ 551,204 16.1% $ 473,275 18.6% Operating income for Underground Mining Machinery increased to $348.8 million in fiscal 2008, or 20.1% of sales, as compared to $285.9 million in fiscal 2007, or 20.1% of sales. The increase in operating income was principally due to the impact of higher volume of $132.0 million and lower pension expense of $12.6 million, partially offset by the impact of a greater mix of lower margin original equipment of $37.0 million, and increased performance based incentive compensation of $23.8 million. Operating income for Surface Mining Equipment increased to $227.4 million in fiscal 2008, or 15.9% of sales, as compared to $217.8 million in fiscal 2007, or 19.4% of sales. The increase in operating income was principally due to increased sales volume of $88.2 million offset by the settlement of a maintenance and repair contract in Australia of $23.0 million, increased performance based incentive compensation of $16.3 million, the retiree benefit cost associated upon the execution of the Steelworkers agreement in Milwaukee of $5.4 million and increased selling, general and administrative expenses to support the global mining infrastructure. Operating income for Crushing & Conveying included $19.6 million of purchase accounting charges in fiscal 2008. Corporate expense increased by $4.3 million due to increased performance based compensation, legal fees and severance costs. The eliminations represent the Stamler crushing equipment which is sold through the Underground Mining Machinery and Surface Mining Equipment segment but managed as part of the Crushing & Conveying segment. Product Development, Selling and Administrative Expense Product development, selling and administrative expense for fiscal 2008 was $441.5 million as compared to $358.5 million for fiscal 2007. The increase in product development, selling and administrative expense was primarily due to $27.4 of additional expenses related to the Continental acquisition, $16.9 million of higher selling expenses related to increased business activity and $28.3 increase in administrative costs due to increased incentive based compensation of $17.2 million and global infrastructure development. Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rates from continuing operations were 29.2% and 37.7%, for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. Income tax expense from continuing operations decreased to $154.0 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to $169.3 million in fiscal 2007. The main drivers of the variance in tax rates and income tax expense Page 27 were higher utilization of U.S. foreign tax credits and the associated Subpart F earnings, tax holidays and incentives in fiscal 2008, U.S. State income taxes, mix of earnings year over year and differences in local statutory tax rates. A discrete tax benefit of $10.4 million was recorded in fiscal 2008 to reflect U.S. foreign tax credits recognition offset partially by U.S. Subpart F income not previously recognized, completion of an R&D study to validate the credits available and offset by the tax required on a dividend between foreign subsidiaries. Fiscal 2007 also included a discrete tax expense of $18.0 million which included taxes on dividends received from foreign subsidiaries during the fourth quarter not previously forecasted, the resolution of an R&D study which resulted in the write off of pre bankruptcy R&D credits, and a reserve added following the quarterly evaluation of a previously disclosed contingent tax liability in South Africa. A review of uncertain income tax positions was performed throughout fiscal 2008 and 2007 as part of the overall income tax provision and a net benefit of $3.5 million and $1.3 million, respectively, was recorded on a global basis. 2007 Compared with 2006 Sales The following table sets forth fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 net sales as derived from our Consolidated Statement of Income: Fiscal Fiscal $ % In thousands 2007 2006 Change Change Net Sales Underground Mining Machinery $ 1,421,715 $ 1,424,803 $ (3,088) Surface Mining Equipment 1,125,607 976,907 148,700 15.2% Total $ 2,547,322 $ 2,401,710 $ 145,612 6.1% The slight decrease in net sales for Underground Mining Machinery in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 was the result of a $41.8 million decrease in original equipment combined with a $38.7 million increase in aftermarket products and service. Weakness in the Central Appalachia region of the United States resulted in a decrease across substantially all original equipment product lines. Chinas original equipment sales also decreased primarily due to lower armored face conveyor and powered roof support sales and on more local competition. Offsetting the impact of the United States and China, increased original equipment sales were reported in Australia and associated with Stamler. International aftermarket sales increased in South Africa and China reflecting continued high level of coal mining activity on a global basis. The increase in net sales for Surface Mining Equipment in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 was the result of a $51.6 million increase in original equipment combined with a $97.1 million increase in aftermarket parts and service. Increases in original equipment sales due to timing of production schedules primarily consisted of increased shovel revenue in two key markets, the Canadian oil sands and China. Aftermarket sales increases were primarily due to $13.7 million in emerging markets and $86.6 million in the United States and most notably in the southwest region of the United States. The emerging market increase was primarily related to continued strength of coal markets in China and Russia, while the southwest increase was due to the continued global demand for copper. Page 28 Operating Income The following table sets forth fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 operating income as derived from our Consolidated Statement of Income: Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Operating % Operating % In thousands Income (loss) of Net Sales Income (loss) of Net Sales Operating income (loss): Underground Mining Machinery $ 285,860 20.1% $ 307,404 21.6% Surface Mining Equipment 217,825 19.4% 165,125 16.9% Corporate Expense (30,410) (30,132) Total $ 473,275 18.6% $ 442,397 18.4% Operating income as a percentage of net sales for Underground Mining Machinery decreased to 20.1% in fiscal 2007 from 21.6% in fiscal 2006. The decrease in operating income was principally due to increased warranty expense of $10.0 million and increased product development, selling and administrative expense of $32.8 million offset by a greater mix of higher margin aftermarket sales and decreased incentive compensation expense. The increase in product development, selling and administrative expense was related to international infrastructure development, the inclusion of Stamler for all of fiscal 2007, and increased pension expense. Operating income as a percentage of net sales for Surface Mining Equipment increased to 19.4% in fiscal 2007 from 16.9% in fiscal 2006. The increase in operating income was principally due to increased sales volume of $40.6 million and a more profitable mix of original equipment and aftermarket sales. Product development, selling and administrative expenses were up approximately $4.0 million in fiscal 2007, but were down 1.1 percentage points in comparison to net sales year over year. Product Development, Selling and Administrative Expense Product development, selling and administrative expense for fiscal 2007 was $358.5 million as compared to $321.8 million for fiscal 2006. The increase in product development, selling and administrative expense was primarily due to $15.0 million of increased warranty costs, $9.7 million of costs related to the development and expansion of global infrastructure, $8.2 million of expenses related to the inclusion of Stamler for all of fiscal 2007, $6.3 million of foreign exchange impact, $3.3 million increase in pension expense, and general inflation. This increase was offset by a $7.2 million decrease in incentive based compensation expense. Interest Expense Interest expense for fiscal 2007 was $31.9 million as compared to $5.7 million for fiscal 2006. The $26.2 million increase was principally due to the November 2006 issuance of $250.0 million of 6% Senior Notes due 2016 and $150.0 million of 6.625% Senior Notes due 2036. The proceeds from the notes were primarily used to finance our common stock repurchase program and to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit agreement. Provision for Income Taxes Our consolidated effective income tax rates from continuing operations for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 were approximately 37.7% and 7.9%, respectively. Consolidated income tax expense from continuing operations increased to $169.3 million in fiscal 2007 as compared to $35.5 million in fiscal 2006. The main drivers of the variance in tax rates and income tax expense were U.S. Subpart F earnings, U.S. State income taxes, mix of earnings year over year, differences in local statutory tax rates and the reversal of certain U.S. and Australian deferred income tax valuation reserves in fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2007 also included tax adjustments of $18.0 million which included taxes on dividends received from foreign subsidiaries during the quarter not previously forecasted, the resolution of an R&D study which resulted in Page 29 the write off of pre bankruptcy R&D credits, and a reserve added following the quarterly evaluation of a previously disclosed contingent tax liability in South Africa. A review of income tax valuation reserves was performed throughout fiscal 2007 as part of the overall income tax provision and a net benefit of $1.3 million was recorded on a global basis. For fiscal 2006, a tax benefit of $110.4 million was recorded relating to the reversal of certain valuation reserves, principally $95.6 million applicable to U.S. deferred income tax assets and $12.5 million related to certain deferred income tax assets applicable to our Australian consolidated tax group. Reorganization Items Reorganization items include income, expenses, and losses that were realized or incurred by the Predecessor Company as a result of its decision to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Net reorganization items for fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007, and fiscal 2006 consisted of the following: Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal In thousands (expense) income 2008 2007 2006 Beloit U.K. claim settlement $ (2,055) $ $ 7,042 Resolution of contingent payable 1,473 Professional fees directly related to the reorganization (364) (745) (220) Net reorganization (expense) income $ (2,419) $ 728 $ 6,822 Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to bad debts, excess inventory, warranty, intangible assets, income taxes, and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the accounting policies described below are the ones that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments, and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results of operations. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize revenue at the time of shipment and passage of title for sales of products and at the time of performance for sales of services. We recognize revenue on long term contracts, such as the manufacture of mining shovels, drills, draglines and roof support systems, using either the percentage of completion or inventory sales methods. When using the percentage of completion method, sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion. Sales and gross profit are adjusted prospectively for revisions in estimated total contract costs and contract values. Estimated losses are recognized in full when identified. We have life cycle management contracts with customers to supply parts and service for terms of 1 to 13 years. These contracts are set up based on the projected costs and revenues of servicing the respective machines over the specified contract terms. Accounting for these contracts requires us to make various estimates, including estimates of the relevant machines long term maintenance requirements. Under these contracts, customers are generally billed monthly and the respective deferred revenues are recorded when billed. Revenue is recognized in the period in which parts are supplied or services provided. These contracts are reviewed periodically and revenue recognition Page 30 is adjusted appropriately for future estimated costs. If a loss is expected at any time, the full amount of the loss is recognized immediately. In limited circumstances, we have customer agreements that are multiple element arrangements as defined by the Financial Accounting Standards Board Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. The agreements are considered for multiple elements based on the following criteria: the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis, there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item and the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item, and delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor. Revenue is then allocated to each identified unit of accounting based on our estimate of their relative fair values. Revenue recognition involves judgments, assessments of expected returns, the likelihood of nonpayment, and estimates of expected costs and profits on long term contracts. We analyze various factors, including a review of specific transactions, historical experience, credit worthiness of customers, and current market and economic conditions, in determining when to recognize revenue. Changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized with a resulting impact on the timing and amount of associated income. Inventories Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first in, first out (FIFO) method for all inventories. We evaluate the need to record valuation adjustments for inventory on a regular basis. Our policy is to evaluate all inventories including raw material, work in process, finished goods, and spare parts. Inventory in excess of our estimated usage requirements is written down to its estimated net realizable value. Inherent in the estimates of net realizable value are estimates related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, possible alternative uses, and ultimate realization of potentially excess inventory. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Intangible assets include drawings, patents, trademarks, technology, customer relationships and other specifically identifiable assets. Indefinite lived intangible assets are not being amortized. These assets are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes occur that suggest impairment in carrying value. Finite lived intangible assets are amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed, which is principally the straight line method. Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes occur that suggest impairment in carrying value. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is tested for impairment using the two step approach, in accordance with Statement on Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142). Goodwill is assigned to specific reporting units and tested for impairment at least annually, during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that a reporting units carrying amount is greater than its fair value. Management judgment is used in the development of assumptions in the impairment testing process, including growth and discount rate assumptions. We performed our goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and no impairment was identified. Accrued Warranties We record accruals for potential warranty claims based on prior claim experience. Warranty costs are accrued at the time revenue is recognized. These warranty costs are based upon managements assessment of past claims and current experience. However, actual claims could be higher or lower than amounts estimated, as the amount and value of warranty claims are subject to variation as a result of many factors that cannot be predicted with certainty. Pension and Postretirement Benefits and Costs We have pension and postretirement benefits and expenses which are developed from actuarial valuations. These valuations are based on assumptions including, among other things, discount rates, expected returns on plan Page 31 assets, retirement ages, years of service, future salary increases, and future health care cost trend rates. Future changes affecting the assumptions will change the related pension benefit or expense. As such, a .25% change in the discount rate and rate of return on net assets would have the following effects on projected benefit obligation and pension expense, respectively, as of and for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2008: .25% Increase .25% Decrease Expected Expected Discount long term Discount long term In thousands Rate rate of return Rate rate of return U.S Pension Plans: Net pension expense $ (2,326) $ 1,618 $ 2,350 $ (1,618) Projected benefit obligation (21,404) 22,063 Non U.S. Pension Plans: Net pension expense (2,454) 1,362 2,491 (1,362) Projected benefit obligation (15,729) 16,307 Other Postretirement Benefit Plans: Net pension expense (43) 7 52 (7) Projected benefit obligation (637) 648 Income Taxes Deferred taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using statutory tax rates. Deferred income tax provisions are based on changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities from period to period, adjusted for certain reclassifications under fresh start accounting. Additionally, we analyze our ability to recognize the net deferred tax assets created in each jurisdiction in which we operate to determine if valuation allowances are necessary based on the more likely than not criteria. As required under the application of fresh start accounting, the release of pre emergence tax valuation reserves was not recorded in the income statement but instead was treated first as a reduction of excess reorganization value until exhausted, then intangibles until exhausted, and thereafter reported as additional paid in capital. Consequently, a net tax charge will be incurred in future years when these tax assets are utilized. We will continue to monitor the appropriateness of the existing valuation allowances and determine annually the amount of valuation allowances that are required to be maintained. As of October 31, 2008, there were $70.5 million of valuation allowances against pre emergence net operating loss carryforwards. All future reversals of pre emergence valuation allowances will be recorded to additional paid in capital. We estimate the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year on an interim basis. The estimated effective tax rate contemplates the expected jurisdiction where income is earned (e.g., United States compared to non United States) as well as tax planning strategies. If the actual results are different from these estimates, adjustments to the effective tax rate may be required in the period such determination is made. Additionally, discrete items are treated separately from the effective rate analysis and are recorded separately as an income tax provision or benefit at the time they are recognized. To the extent recognized, these items will impact the effective tax rate in aggregate but will not adjust the amount used for future periods within the same fiscal year. Page 32 Liquidity and Capital Resources Working capital and cash flow are two financial measurements that provide an indication of our ability to meet our financial obligations. We currently use a combination of cash generated by operations, borrowings on our line of credit and debt offerings to fund continuing operations. The following table summarizes the major elements of our working capital as of October 31, 2008 and October 26, 2007, respectively: October 31, October 26, In millions 2008 2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 201.6 $ 173.2 Accounts receivable 632.2 560.2 Inventories 805.2 727.4 Other current assets 99.2 77.0 Short term notes payable, including current portion of long term obligations (26.5) (0.2) Accounts payable (291.8) (199.2) Employee compensation and benefits (110.0) (59.5) Advance payments and progress billings (491.7) (324.1) Accrued warranties (46.6) (49.4) Other accrued liabilities (173.8) (121.1) Working Capital $ 597.8 $ 784.3 We currently use working capital and cash flow production as two financial measurements to evaluate the performance of our operations and our ability to meet our financial obligations. We continue to require working capital investment to maintain our position as a leading manufacturer and servicer of high productivity mining equipment. The primary drivers of these requirements are funding for purchases of production and replacement parts inventories. Our position as a market leader in providing timely service and repair requires us to maintain a certain level of replacement parts. As part of our continuous improvement of purchasing and manufacturing processes, we continue to strive for alignment of inventory levels with customer demand and current production schedules. We expect fiscal 2009 capital spending to be between 2.5% and 3.0% of sales. This represents an increase from fiscal 2008 capital spending as a percentage of sales of up to 0.5%. Capital projects will be monitored to ensure alignment with customer needs and prevailing economic conditions. In addition, cash is required for capital expenditures for the repair, replacement, and upgrading of existing facilities. We have debt service requirements, including commitment and letter of credit fees under our revolving credit facility and biannual interest payments due to holders of our Senior Notes issued in November 2006. We believe that cash generated from operations, together with borrowings available under our credit facility, provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our operating and debt service requirements and planned capital expenditures. For the long term the fundamentals of the commodity cycle remain positive, near term softness will require continuous reevaluation of new projects to ensure that we are effectively allocating resources in line with current market conditions. In fiscal 2008, we completed a $50 million 130,000 square foot expansion in proprietary component machining capabilities for P&H Mining at our Tianjin, China campus, with first piece runoff of currently installed equipment completed early in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, with full production targeted for the second half of fiscal 2009. As we look to provide more efficient operations amongst our customers and three operating segments, we are in the process of consolidating six smaller existing facilities in Australia into one combined underground and surface mining service center and manufacturing facility. Page 33 Cash provided by operations for fiscal 2008 was $577.3 million as compared to $382.0 million provided by operations for fiscal 2007. The increase in our cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to our continued focus on obtaining advance payments for original equipment. The increase in advance payments was offset by further increases in inventory and accounts receivable. Inventory management and forecasting remains a key initiative for us in fiscal 2009. Cash used by investment activities for fiscal 2008 was $328.7 million as compared to $62.3 million used by investment activities for fiscal 2007. The increase in cash used by investment activities was primarily due to the $252.1 million acquisition of Continental in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. Capital expenditures increased by $33.0 million in fiscal 2008 up to $84.2 million primarily related to the upgrade of existing facilities, machines tools related to the Tianjin facility, further SAP implementations, and other projects. Cash used by financing activities for fiscal 2008 was $180.6 million as compared to $255.1 million used by financing activities for fiscal 2007. The cash used by financing activities for fiscal 2008 primarily consisted of the repurchase of outstanding stock of $307.7 million, offset by the increase of $161.9 million outstanding on our term loan supplement under the revolving credit facility. During fiscal 2008, we contributed $58.7 million to our worldwide pension plans compared to $18.5 million during fiscal 2007. Although no contributions were required to be made to qualified U.S. plans, a contribution of $32.5 million was made in fiscal 2008 in order to maintain plan flexibility. We expect to make required contributions of $58.2 million to our U.S. plans and $19.2 million to our Non U.S. plans in fiscal 2009. The significance of the required funding requirements of our pension plans will be largely based on the investment performance of the plans assets, the actual results of the other actuarial assumptions and most importantly, the impact of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). Continental Acquisition On February 14, 2008 we completed the acquisition of N.E.S. Investment Co. (Parent) and thereby its subsidiary, Continental Global Group, Inc. a worldwide leader in conveyor systems for bulk material handling in mining and industrial applications. The Continental acquisition further strengthens our ability to provide a more complete mining solution to our customers. We purchased all of the outstanding shares of the Parent for an aggregate amount of $252.1 million, which was net of approximately $5.9 million of indebtedness we assumed at closing and $12.0 million of cash acquired. We also incurred $2.3 million of direct acquisition costs related to the acquisition. The purchase price was funded in part through available cash and credit resources and a new $175.0 million term loan supplement to our existing Credit Agreement (Second Amendment), as discussed below. Following the Continental acquisition, the reportable segments for Joy Global Inc. were reevaluated and a new segment was created, Crushing & Conveying. Included in the Crushing & Conveying segment is the entire acquired Continental entity, along with the Stamler crushing equipment business, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The Stamler crushing equipment is currently being sold through the Underground Mining Machinery or Surface Mining Equipment segments to third parties, but is being supplied to each unit through the Crushing & Conveying segment. Credit Facilities We have a $400.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (Credit Agreement) which expires November 10, 2011. Outstanding borrowings bear interest equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR Rate) (defined as applicable LIBOR Rate for the equivalent interest period plus 0.5% to 1.25%) or the Base Rate (defined as the higher of the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5%) at our option. We pay a commitment fee ranging from 0.125% to 0.25% on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility based on our credit rating. The Credit Agreement requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants including leverage and interest coverage. The Credit Agreement also restricts payments of dividends or other return of capital based on the consolidated leverage ratio. At October 31, 2008, we were in compliance with all financial covenants in the Credit Agreement and had no restrictions on the payment of dividends or return of capital. Page 34 At October 31, 2008, there were no direct borrowings under the Credit Agreement. Outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement, which count toward the $400.0 million credit limit, totaled $141.4 million. At October 31, 2008, there was $258.6 million available for borrowings under the Credit Agreement. The Continental acquisition was funded in part through the Second Amendment, which calls for quarterly principal payments of 2.5% of the initial term loan through October 31, 2011, at which time the remaining outstanding principal equal to 62.5% of the initial term loan is due. As of October 31, 2008, $161.9 million is outstanding on the term loan. Outstanding borrowings bear interest equal to the LIBOR rate which has a weighted average interest rate of 3.70%. As part of the Second Amendment, we have the option to request an increase to the term loan outstanding not to exceed $75.0 million. No changes were made to existing financial covenants in fiscal 2008. In November 2006, we issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.0% Senior Notes due 2016 and $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.625% Senior Notes due 2036 (Notes) with interest on the Notes being paid semi annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, starting on May 15, 2007. The Notes are guaranteed by each of our current and future significant domestic subsidiaries. The Notes were issued in a private placement under an exemption from registration provided by the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), as amended. In the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the Notes were exchanged for similar notes registered under the Securities Act. At our option, we may redeem some or all of the Notes at a redemption price of the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the principal amounts and the remaining scheduled interest payments using a discount rate equal to the sum of a treasury rate of a comparable treasury issue plus 0.3% for the 2016 Notes and 0.375% for the 2036 Notes. Our credit rating by both Standard and Poors and Moodys has remained consistent in fiscal 2008. Standard and Poors credit rating is BBB with an outlook of Stable. Moodys credit rating is Baa3 with a continued outlook of Stable. In the first quarter of fiscal 2009, Moodys confirmed the Baa3 rating with a positive outlook. These investment grade credit ratings provide us with greater flexibility to access financing on the open market as our business circumstances justify. Advance Payments and Progress Billings As part of the negotiation process associated with original equipment orders, there are generally advance payments obtained from our customers. As of October 31, 2008, advance payments and progress billings were $491.7 million. As orders are shipped or costs incurred, the advanced payments and progress billings are reclassified to revenue on the consolidated income statement. Stock Repurchase Program Under our original share repurchase program, management is authorized to repurchase up to $1.0 billion in shares in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions until December 31, 2008. On September 9, 2008, the Board of Directors revised the authorization to permit the repurchase of up to an additional $1.0 billion of outstanding common stock until December 31, 2011. During fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, we repurchased $307.7 million of common stock representing 6,040,727 shares and $499.7 million of common stock, representing 11,076,960 shares, respectively. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We lease various assets under operating leases. The aggregate payments under operating leases as of October 31, 2008 are disclosed in the table of Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments below. No significant changes to lease commitments have occurred since October 26, 2007. We have no other off balance sheet arrangements.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Volatility in interest rates, commodity price risk, and foreign exchange rates can impact our earnings, equity, and cash flow. From time to time we undertake transactions to hedge this impact. Under generally accepted accounting principles, a hedge instrument is considered effective if it offsets partially or completely the impact on earnings, equity, and cash flow due to fluctuations in interest, commodity, and foreign exchange rates. In accordance with our policy, we do not execute derivatives that are speculative or that increase our risk from interest rate, commodity price, or foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long term debt obligations. The interest rate environment causes volatility in our variable rate borrowings and affects the value of our fixed rate debt. We manage this risk through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate debt (See Note 4 Borrowings and Credit Facilities). At October 31, 2008 we were not party to any interest rate derivative contracts. Commodity Price Risk For most of fiscal 2008, the increased global demand for certain commodities correlated directly with the risk of higher prices for certain raw materials. As compared to fiscal 2007, the higher consumption levels of steel from emerging markets continued to increase prices we were charged. We currently manage this risk by passing on a portion of these price increases to our customers. At October 31, 2008, we are not party to any commodity forward contracts. Foreign Currency Risk Most of our foreign subsidiaries use local currencies as their functional currency. For consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities are translated at month end exchange rates. Items of income and expense are translated at average exchange rates. Translation gains and losses are not included in determining net income (loss) but are accumulated as a separate component of shareholders equity. Gains (losses) arising from foreign currency transactions are included in determining net income (loss). During fiscal 2008, we realized a gain of $3.3 million arising from foreign currency transactions. Foreign exchange derivatives at October 31, 2008 were in the form of forward exchange contracts executed over the counter. There is a concentration of these contracts held with Bank of America, N.A. which maintains an investment grade rating. Page 36 We have a risk averse Foreign Exchange Risk Management Policy under which significant exposures that impact earnings and cash flows are fully hedged. Exposures that impact only equity or do not have a cash flow impact are generally not hedged with derivatives. We hedge two categories of foreign exchange exposures: assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency, which include future committed receipts or payments denominated in a foreign currency and certain U.S. functional currency entity balance sheet accounts denominated in local currencies. These exposures normally arise from imports and exports of goods and from intercompany trade and lending activity. The fair value of our forward exchange contracts at October 31, 2008 is analyzed in the following table of dollar equivalent terms: In thousands of U.S. Dollars Fair Value Buy Sell U.S. Dollar $ 8,412 $ (6,870) Australian Dollar (8,084) 273 British Pound Sterling (26,471) 4,505 Canadian Dollar (2,319) 1,091 South African Rand (1,437) 102 Euro (99) (20) Brazilian Real (1,507) 216 Czech Koruna (22) Hungarian Forint (90) 8 Chinese Yuan (1,435) Chilean Peso (1,431) 6,284 Polish Zloty 44 The following tables present our forward exchange contract balances with an aggregate notional amount greater than $5.0 million.
