Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes. References made to years are for fiscal year periods. Dollar amounts are in thousands, except share and per share data and as indicated. The purpose of this discussion and analysis is to enhance the understanding and evaluation of the results of operations, financial position, cash flows, indebtedness, and other key financial information of Joy Global Inc. and its subsidiaries for fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007. For a more complete understanding of this discussion, please read the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. Overview We are the direct successor to businesses that have been manufacturing mining equipment for as much as 125 years. We operate in three business segments: Underground Mining Machinery, comprised of our Joy Mining Machinery business, Surface Mining Equipment, comprised of our P&H Mining Equipment business and Continental Crushing & Conveying. Joy is a leading producer of high productivity underground mining equipment used primarily for the extraction of coal. P&H is the worlds largest producer of high productivity electric mining shovels and a major producer of walking draglines and large rotary blasthole drills, used primarily for surface mining copper, coal, iron ore, oil sands, and other minerals. CCC is a worldwide leader in crushing and sizing equipment and conveyor systems for bulk material handling in mining and industrial applications. In addition to selling new equipment, we provide parts, components, repairs, rebuilds, diagnostic analysis, fabrication, training, and other aftermarket services for our installed base of machines. In the case of Surface Mining Equipment, we also provide aftermarket services for equipment manufactured by other companies, including manufacturers with which we have ongoing relationships and which we refer to as Alliance Partners. We emphasize our aftermarket products and services as an integral part of lowering our customers cost per unit of production and are focused on continuing to grow this part of our business. Operating Results Net sales for fiscal 2009 totaled $3.6 billion, compared with $3.4 billion in fiscal 2008. This $179.4 million increase in net sales was after a negative impact of $160.5 million associated with changes in foreign currency translation rates during fiscal 2009. The increase in net sales was the result of a 13% improvement in original equipment shipments and a $64.4 million benefit from including Continental sales for the full year in fiscal 2009 compared to eight months in fiscal 2008. Aftermarket net sales in fiscal 2009 were substantially the same level as they were in fiscal 2008. Net sales for the underground equipment business were up 11% in fiscal 2009 compared to a year ago, while the surface mining equipment business reported a 6% decline in net sales. Operating income totaled $702.3 million in fiscal 2009 compared to $551.2 million in fiscal 2008. The increase in operating income was the result of increased volume, favorable 2008 pricing converting to sales, improved supply chain management, the benefits from cost control initiatives and $8.5 million of cancellation income. These favorable items were partially offset by a $21.8 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation rates, $14.4 million of severance and related expenses and the effect of greater mix of original equipment sales. The 2008 fiscal year was adversely impacted by a $22.7 million charge related to the cancellation of a maintenance and repair contract in Australia, a $13.5 million higher level of purchase accounting amortization expense associated with the Continental acquisition in February 2008 and a $5.5 million charge related to a labor contract settlement. Net income was $454.7 million or $4.41 per diluted share in fiscal 2009 compared with $374.3 million or $3.45 per diluted share in fiscal 2008. Bookings for fiscal 2009 were $2.5 billion, excluding a $605.9 million reduction in the backlog made during the third quarter to reflect the companys change in new order booking policy compared to bookings of $4.8 billion in fiscal 2008. Bookings decreases were seen across most commodity and geographic markets. The decrease in bookings was made up of a $1.8 billion decline in original equipment orders, a $172.3 million reduction in aftermarket orders and included $314.1 million of cancelled orders. The decrease in original equipment orders reflect the increased ordering level of new machines which took place in the latter part of the 2008 fiscal year as customers wanted surety of equipment supply as commodity prices had risen to exceptionally high levels and then declined significantly at the beginning of the our 2009 fiscal year. A large portion of these fiscal 2008 orders were for equipment to be delivered in fiscal 2011 and beyond and substantially all of the fiscal 2009 order cancellations and backlog adjustment came from 2008 bookings. Page 27 Market Outlook Demand for mined commodities continues to be dominated by strong imports from the emerging markets, and from China and India in particular, with improving but still weak fundamentals from the industrialized countries. For the past year, China has been the major source of increased demand for commodities as it deployed a more effective stimulus program and more constructive credit policies. However, the China economy is primarily driven by exports to the United States, Europe and Japan, and continued growth in commodity demand from China requires the return of industrial production in the industrialized countries. Industrial production outside of China has improved more recently as inventory de stocking reaches completion. However, demand growth beyond the de stocking effect remains sluggish. Trends in U.S. steel production can be indicative of broader industrial trends excluding China. With steel production in the United States bottoming in April, by July, extensive de stocking had reduced steel inventories by over half. Since the completion of de stocking, steel production has improved as sales out of production replace previous sales out of inventory. Beyond the effect of completed de stocking, end use demand in the U.S. remains soft. Seaborne metallurgical coal and iron ore demand remains strong as China steel production continues at high levels and imports are starting to move into other steel producing regions. Total China met coal imports were about six times higher than last year. As a result, the seaborne met coal spot market is thin, with some producers already sold out for 2010. China imports, plus an increase in global steel production have pushed met coal spot prices well above this years benchmark. Iron ore is under similar demand pressure, with its spot prices above $100 per metric ton, off of a low in February. The thermal coal outlook varies dramatically between the seaborne markets and the U.S. market. China and India are major factors in the seaborne market, with China imports already double 2008. Imports increased significantly in 2009 due to rapidly improving electricity demand and the process of restructuring small mines in the Shanxi and Heibei provinces. Much of the increase is considered structural, with the electricity generators along the southeastern coast expected to rely increasingly on imported coal to avoid rail capacity constraints and because strong domestic prices are making imports competitive. Indias coal imports also continue to increase, with some projections showing coal imports potentially quadrupling by 2014. Based on this continued strong emerging market demand, seaborne thermal coal spot prices have risen recently. Supply shortages are expected to continue, with seaborne thermal coal being contracted for 2011 and 2012 at even higher prices. The thermal coal markets in the U.S. continue to be weak, with demand from coal fired electricity generation down year to date. There has been some seasonal improvement, and the most recent data shows coal fired generation up from its low in April. As a result, generator stockpiles were reduced in both tons and days in the most recent report. However, stockpiles remain at historically high levels, and will delay recovery in the U.S. thermal coal market for 12 to 18 months. On the positive side, higher natural gas forward month prices are reducing the economic incentive to dispatch natural gas fired plants, and 22 gigawatts of new coal fired plants should add to thermal coal demand by 2012. Copper demand has been increasing as China has strategically restocked, but with inventories high copper imports are expected to moderate. However, China imports are expected to remain above their import levels of 2007 and 2008. Based on a continued healthy demand from China and the expectation that demand from the rest of the world will turn positive later this year, the 2010 price forecast for copper has been revised up several times and is now well over $3.00, with the expectation of further supply shortages and price increases in 2011. Seaborne traded commodity prices are strong and improving based on the strength of current demand from the emerging markets, the start of demand improvement from the industrialized countries, and the realization that mining will run out of excess capacity well before the industrial sector reaches its full capacity. Mining companies see the need to restart expansion projects and have been announcing significant increases in their capital expenditure budgets for 2010. Page 28 Company Outlook We see fiscal 2009 as the cyclical floor for incoming orders based on consistency of the order rate over the past four quarters, the continuation of strong commodity demand from the emerging markets complemented by improving commodity demand from the major industrialized countries, and the limited upside in current mining capacity. Our customers are increasing their capital expenditure budgets for fiscal 2010, and are also validating equipment specifications and confirming production slots to enable them to reactivate some of the projects they previously put on hold. As such, we expect fiscal 2010 to be a year of improving order rates. We expect original equipment orders to return to their typical lumpy pattern due to the timing and size of each project. Based on commodity fundamentals and discussions with customers, we expect that copper, international coal, iron ore and oil sands to have the greatest potential for original equipment orders during fiscal 2010. Original equipment orders for the U.S. coal market will be limited to met coal demand and otherwise to machine replacements based on the higher productivity of new technology. Aftermarket orders in our second half of fiscal 2009 were up 6 percent from the first half, and we expect this trend of steady improvement to continue as our international customers bring production back on line during fiscal 2010.

The increase in net sales was the result of a $179.5 million increase in original equipment sales combined with a $6.8 million increase in the sales of aftermarket products and service. Original equipment sales in the Americas increased by $194.6 million primarily as a result of increased sales of room and pillar application equipment and roof supports used in long wall system applications. Original equipment sales also increased in South Africa by $111.0 million due to increased demand for equipment used in both room and pillar and longwall applications. Original equipment sales decreased by $74.9 million in Eurasia primarily due to decreased roof support sales while original equipment sales in China decreased by $43.8 million primarily due to lower continuous miner and armored face conveyor sales. Aftermarket sales were flat or slightly down in all markets with the exception of the United States. The surface mining equipment business was also unfavorably impacted by foreign currency translation changes during the 2009 fiscal year, with $36.2 million out of the net sales decline being attributable to the effects of foreign currency translation. The decrease in net sales for Surface Mining Equipment in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was the result of a $59.9 million decrease in original equipment sales combined with a $24.7 million decrease in aftermarket parts and service. Original equipment sales, primarily consisting of electric mining shovel sales, decreased in China and Canada, partially offset by increased sales in the United States and Australia. Reduced production activity by our customers translated into lower aftermarket products and service revenues with decreased sales of $63.4 million in the United States, partially offset by increased sales of $25.4 million and $22.7 million in Chile and Canada, respectively. The increase in net sales for Crushing & Conveying in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was the result of a $66.6 million increase in original equipment sales, offset by a $2.2 million decrease in aftermarket products and services primarily due to the Continental Conveyor acquisition made on February 14, 2008, and therefore the 2008 fiscal year only included eight and one half months of the Continental Conveyor net sales. Crushing & Conveying sales were also unfavorably impacted by $9.6 million of foreign currency translation. The eliminations represent the Stamler crushing equipment which is sold through the Underground Mining Machinery and Surface Mining Equipment segments but managed as part of the Crushing & Conveying segment. Page 30 Operating Income The following table sets forth fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 operating income as derived from our Consolidated Statement of Income: Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 Operating % Operating % In thousands Income (loss) of Net Sales Income (loss) of Net Sales Operating income (loss): Underground Mining Machinery $ 428,783 22.1 % $ 348,830 19.9 % Surface Mining Equipment 301,712 22.4 % 227,382 15.9 % Crushing & Conveying 42,410 10.5 % 27,856 8.2 % Corporate Expense (41,759 ) (34,897 ) Eliminations (28,834 ) (17,967 ) Total $ 702,312 19.5 % $ 551,204 16.1 % Operating income for Underground Mining Machinery increased to $428.8 million in fiscal 2009, or 22.1% of sales, as compared to $348.8 million in fiscal 2008, or 19.9% of sales. As was the case with net sales, operating income in fiscal 2009 was unfavorably affected by the impact of foreign currency translation rate changes. This impact reduced operating income in 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 by $25.5 million. Operating income increased in fiscal 2009 due to increased sales and improved price realization which contributed $72.0 million, lower material costs, spending control measures and the benefits associated with the companys operating excellence initiatives, partially offset by the cost incurred in connection with various cost reduction actions and the effect of a higher mix of original equipment. Operating income for Surface Mining Equipment increased to $301.7 million in fiscal 2009, or 22.4% of sales, as compared to $227.4 million in fiscal 2008, or 15.9% of sales. The increase in operating income was primarily due to favorable price realization, reduced material costs, spending control measures and $8.5 million of cancellation income. In addition, fiscal 2008 operating income was unfavorably impacted by a $22.7 million charge for the cancellation of a maintenance and repair contract in Australia and a $5.5 million charge for retiree benefit costs associated with the execution of the Steelworkers agreement in Milwaukee. Operating income for Crushing & Conveying increased to $42.4 million in fiscal 2009, or 10.5% of sales, as compared to $27.9 million in fiscal 2008, or 8.2% of sales. The increase in operating income was primarily due to a decreased amortization of $13.5 million and inclusion of the conveyor business for all of fiscal 2009 as compared to eight and a half months in fiscal 2008. Corporate expense increased by $6.9 million primarily due to increased professional service fees, recruiting and relocation fees associated with the filling of senior management positions and an increase in equity incentive based performance compensation. The eliminations represent the Stamler crushing equipment which is sold through the Underground Mining Machinery and Surface Mining Equipment segments but managed as part of the Crushing & Conveying segment. Product Development, Selling and Administrative Expense Product development, selling and administrative expense for fiscal 2009 was $454.5 million, as compared to $441.5 million for fiscal 2008. The increase in product development, selling and administrative expense was primarily due to $14.4 million of severance and other related expense associated with various cost reduction initiatives implemented during the 2009 fiscal year. The increase in corporate expense outlined previously and general inflationary increases were offset by the favorable impact of $23.7 million on spending amounts due to foreign currency translation and the spending controls put in place. Page 31 Provision for Income Taxes Income tax expense for fiscal 2009 was $228.0 million as compared to $154.0 million in fiscal 2008. The effective income tax rates from continuing operations were 33.4% and 29.2%, for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively. The main drivers of the variance in tax rates when compared to the statutory rate of 35% were the geographic mix of earnings with the corresponding net favorable differences in foreign statutory tax rates and the utilization of tax credits and tax holidays offset by increased state income taxes and tax account corrections. A discrete tax expense of $8.2 million was recorded in fiscal 2009 as compared to a discrete tax benefit of $10.4 million in fiscal 2008. A review of uncertain income tax positions was performed throughout fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 as part of the overall income tax provision and a net benefit of $1.8 million and $3.5 million, respectively, was recorded on a global basis. 2008 Compared with 2007 Sales The following table sets forth fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 net sales as derived from our Consolidated Statement of Income: Fiscal Fiscal $ % In thousands 2008 2007 Change Change Net Sales Underground Mining Machinery $ 1,750,183 $ 1,436,109 $ 314,074 21.9 % Surface Mining Equipment 1,432,297 1,126,002 306,295 27.2 % Crushing & Conveying 339,421 Eliminations (102,967 ) (14,789 ) Total $ 3,418,934 $ 2,547,322 $ 871,612 34.2 % The increase in net sales for Underground Mining Machinery in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was the result of a $208.5 million increase in original equipment combined with a $105.6 million increase in aftermarket products and service. Original equipment sales in the Americas increased by $88.2 million, primarily due to growth in the Central Appalachia region across substantially all original equipment product lines. Original equipment sales also increased in China primarily due to increased armored face conveyor and shearer sales and in Eurasia primarily due to the sale of a powered roof support system in fiscal 2008. United States aftermarket sales increased reflecting continued investment in both existing and greenfield metallurgical and thermal projects. The increase in net sales for Surface Mining Equipment in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was the result of a $142.0 million increase in original equipment combined with a $164.3 million increase in aftermarket parts and service. Increases in original equipment sales due to timing of production schedules primarily consisted of increased shovel revenue in the Canadian oil sands, the United States, Chile and China. As a result of the increasing installed base of electric mining shovels, aftermarket sales increased by $61.3 million in the United States, $60.0 million in Chile, and $48.0 million in Canada. The net sales in Crushing & Conveying represented the strength of the crushing equipment and conveying systems and aftermarket parts and services in the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom. Revenue from this segment was included from the February 14, 2008 acquisition date of N.E.S. Investment Co. The eliminations represent the Stamler crushing equipment which is sold through the Underground Mining Machinery and Surface Mining Equipment segments but managed as part of the Crushing & Conveying segment. Page 32 Operating Income The following table sets forth fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 operating income as derived from our Consolidated Statement of Income: Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 Operating % Operating % In thousands Income (loss) of Net Sales Income (loss) of Net Sales Operating income (loss): Underground Mining Machinery $ 348,830 19.9 % $ 285,860 19.9 % Surface Mining Equipment 227,382 15.9 % 217,825 19.3 % Crushing & Conveying 27,856 8.2 % Corporate Expense (34,897 ) (29,961 ) Eliminations (17,967 ) (449 ) Total $ 551,204 16.1 % $ 473,275 18.6 % Operating income for Underground Mining Machinery increased to $348.8 million in fiscal 2008, or 19.9% of sales, as compared to $285.9 million in fiscal 2007, or 19.9% of sales. The increase in operating income was principally due to the impact of higher volume of $132.0 million and lower pension expense of $12.6 million, partially offset by the impact of a greater mix of lower margin original equipment of $37.0 million, and increased performance based incentive compensation of $23.8 million. Operating income for Surface Mining Equipment increased to $227.4 million in fiscal 2008, or 15.9% of sales, as compared to $217.8 million in fiscal 2007, or 19.3% of sales. The increase in operating income was principally due to increased sales volume of $88.2 million offset by the settlement of a maintenance and repair contract in Australia of $23.0 million, increased performance based incentive compensation of $16.3 million, the retiree benefit cost associated upon the execution of the Steelworkers agreement in Milwaukee of $5.4 million and increased selling, general and administrative expenses to support the global mining infrastructure. Operating income for Crushing & Conveying included $19.6 million of purchase accounting charges in fiscal 2008. Corporate expense increased by $4.3 million due to increased performance based compensation, legal fees and severance costs. The eliminations mainly represent the Stamler crushing equipment which is sold through the Underground Mining Machinery and Surface Mining Equipment segment but managed as part of the Crushing & Conveying segment. Product Development, Selling and Administrative Expense Product development, selling and administrative expense for fiscal 2008 was $441.5 million as compared to $358.5 million for fiscal 2007. The increase in product development, selling and administrative expense was primarily due to $27.4 of additional expenses related to the Continental acquisition, $16.9 million of higher selling expenses related to increased business activity and $28.3 million increase in administrative costs due to increased incentive based compensation of $17.2 million and global infrastructure development. Page 33 Provision for Income Taxes Income tax expense for fiscal 2008 was $154.0 million as compared to $169.3 million in fiscal 2007. The effective income tax rates from continuing operations were 29.2% and 37.7%, for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. The main drivers of the variance in tax rates and income tax expense were higher utilization of U.S. foreign tax credits and the associated Subpart F earnings, tax holidays and incentives in fiscal 2008, U.S. State income taxes, mix of earnings year over year and differences in local statutory tax rates. A discrete tax benefit of $10.4 million was recorded in fiscal 2008 to reflect U.S. foreign tax credit recognition offset partially by U.S. Subpart F income not previously recognized, completion of an R&D study to validate the available credits and by the tax required on a dividend between foreign subsidiaries. Fiscal 2007 also included a discrete tax expense of $18.0 million which included taxes on dividends received from foreign subsidiaries during the fourth quarter not previously forecasted, the resolution of an R&D study which resulted in the reversing of pre bankruptcy R&D credits, and a reserve added following the quarterly evaluation of a previously disclosed contingent tax liability in South Africa. A review of uncertain income tax positions was performed throughout fiscal 2008 and 2007 as part of the overall income tax provision and a net benefit of $3.5 million and $1.3 million, respectively, was recorded on a global basis. Reorganization Items Reorganization items include income, expenses, and losses that were realized or incurred by the Predecessor Company as a result of its decision to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Net reorganization items for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 consisted of the following: Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal In thousands 2009 2008 2007 Beloit U.K. claim settlement $ $ (2,055 ) $ Beloit U.K. receivership settlement 5,665 Resolution of contingent payable 1,473 Professional fees directly related to the reorganization (605 ) (364 ) (745 ) Net reorganization income (expense) $ 5,060 $ (2,419 ) $ 728 Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to bad debts, excess inventory, warranty, intangible assets, income taxes, and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the accounting policies described below are the policies that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments, and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results of operations. Page 34 Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue on aftermarket products and services when the following criteria are satisfied: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, product delivery and title transfer has occurred or the services have been rendered, the price is fixed and determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue on long term contracts, such as for the manufacture of mining shovels, drills, draglines, roof support systems and conveyor systems, using either the percentage of completion or inventory sales method. We generally recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method for original equipment that requires a minimum of six months to produce. When using the percentage of completion method, sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion. Sales and gross profit are adjusted prospectively for revisions in estimated total contract costs and contract values. Estimated losses are recognized in full when identified. Approximately 83% of our sales in fiscal 2009 were recorded at the time of shipment of the product or delivery of the service. The remaining 17% of sales was recorded using percentage of completion accounting, a practice we follow in recognizing revenue on the sale of long lead time equipment such as electric mining shovels, walking draglines, powered roof support systems and conveyor systems. We have life cycle management contracts with customers to supply parts and service for terms of 1 to 13 years. These contracts are established based on the conditions the equipment will be operating in, the time horizon that the program will cover, and the expected operating cycle that will be required for the equipment. Based on this information, a model is created representing the projected costs and revenues of servicing the respective machines over the specified contract terms. Accounting for these contracts requires us to make various estimates, including estimates of the relevant machines long term maintenance requirements. Under these contracts, customers are generally billed monthly based on hours of operation or units of production achieved by the equipment, with the respective deferred revenues recorded when billed. Revenue is recognized in the period in which parts are supplied or services provided. These contracts are reviewed quarterly by comparison of actual results to original estimates or most recent analysis, with revenue recognition adjusted appropriately for future estimated costs. If a loss is expected at any time, the full amount of the loss is recognized immediately. In limited circumstances, we have customer agreements that are multiple element arrangements as defined by the ASC No. 605 25 Multiple Element Arrangements. The agreements are assessed for multiple elements based on the following criteria: the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis, there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item and the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor. Revenue is then allocated to each identified unit of accounting based on our estimate of their relative fair values. Revenue recognition involves judgments, including assessments of expected returns, the likelihood of nonpayment, and estimates of expected costs and profits on long term contracts. We analyze various factors, including a review of specific transactions, historical experience, credit worthiness of customers, and current market and economic conditions, in determining when to recognize revenue. Changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized with a resulting impact on the timing and amount of associated income. Inventories Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first in, first out (FIFO) method for all inventories. We evaluate the need to record valuation adjustments for inventory on a regular basis. Our policy is to evaluate all inventories including raw material, work in process, finished goods, and spare parts. Inventory in excess of our estimated usage requirements is written down to its estimated net realizable value. Inherent in the estimates of net realizable value are estimates related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, possible alternative uses, and ultimate realization of potentially excess inventory. Page 35 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Intangible assets include drawings, patents, trademarks, technology, customer relationships and other specifically identifiable assets. Indefinite lived intangible assets are not being amortized. Indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes occur that suggest impairment in carrying value, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate. As part of the impairment analysis, we use the discounted cash flow model based on royalties estimated to be derived in the future use of the asset were we to license the use of the trademark or tradename. No impairment was identified as part of our fourth quarter impairment testing of our indefinite lived intangible assets. Finite lived intangible assets are amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed, which is principally the straight line method. Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment if events or changes occur that suggest impairment in carrying value. No impairment was identified related to our finite lived intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is assigned to specific reporting units, which we have identified as our operating segments, and tested for impairment at least annually, during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that a reporting units carrying amount is greater than its fair value. Goodwill is tested for impairment using the two step approach, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other. The determination of an impairment requires the valuation of the respective reporting unit, which we estimate using the discounted cash flow model and market approach. The discounted cash flow model involves many assumptions, including operating results forecasts and discount rates. Inherent in the operating results forecasts are certain assumptions regarding revenue growth rates, projected cost saving initiatives and projected long term growth rates in the determination of terminal values. We performed our goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and no impairment was identified. A one percentage point increase in the discount rate used to determine the fair value of the reporting units would not cause the carrying value of the respective reporting unit to exceed its fair value. Accrued Warranties We record accruals for potential warranty claims based on prior claim experience. Warranty costs are accrued at the time revenue is recognized. These warranty costs are based upon managements assessment of past claims and current experience. However, actual claims could be higher or lower than amounts estimated, as the amount and value of warranty claims are subject to variation as a result of many factors that cannot be predicted with certainty. Pension and Postretirement Benefits and Costs Pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. The primary assumptions include factors such as discount rates, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates and rate of compensation increases, discussed below: Discount rates: We generally estimate the discount rate for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations using a process based on a hypothetical investment in a portfolio of high quality bonds that approximate the estimated cash flows of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. We believe this approach permits a matching of future cash outflows related to benefit payments with future cash inflows associated with bond coupons and maturities. Expected return on plan assets: Our expected return on plan assets is derived from reviews of asset allocation strategies and anticipated future long term performance of individual asset classes. Our analysis gives appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns; however, the assumptions are primarily based on long term, prospective rates of return. Mortality rates: Mortality rates are based on the RP 2000 mortality table. Page 36 Rate of compensation increase: The rate of compensation increases reflects our long term actual experience and its outlook, including consideration of expected rates of inflation. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods, and therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement plan obligations and future expense. Future changes affecting the above assumptions will change the related pension benefit or expense. As such, a 0.25% change in the discount rate and rate of return on net assets would have the following effects on projected benefit obligation and pension expense, respectively, as of and for the fiscal year ended October 30, 2009: 0.25% Increase 0.25% Decrease Expected Expected Discount long term Discount long term In thousands Rate rate of return Rate rate of return U.S Pension Plans: Net pension expense $ ( 159 ) $ (1,640 ) $ 128 $ 1,640 Projected benefit obligation (28,858 ) 29,710 Non U.S. Pension Plans: Net pension expense (349 ) (1,072 ) 506 1,072 Projected benefit obligation (19,043 ) 19,725 Other Postretirement Benefit Plans: Net pension expense (35 ) (5 ) 33 5 Projected benefit obligation (523 ) 533 Income Taxes Deferred taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using statutory tax rates. Deferred income tax provisions are based on changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities from period to period, adjusted for certain reclassifications under fresh start accounting. Additionally, we analyze our ability to recognize the net deferred tax assets created in each jurisdiction in which we operate to determine if valuation allowances are necessary based on the more likely than not criteria. As required under the application of fresh start accounting, the release of pre emergence tax valuation reserves was not recorded in the income statement but instead was treated first as a reduction of excess reorganization value until exhausted, then intangibles until exhausted, and thereafter reported as additional paid in capital. Consequently, a net tax charge will be incurred in future years when these tax assets are utilized. We will continue to monitor the appropriateness of the existing valuation allowances and determine annually the amount of valuation allowances that are required to be maintained. As of October 30, 2009, there were $68.0 million of valuation allowances against pre emergence net operating loss carryforwards. All future reversals of pre emergence valuation allowances will be recorded to additional paid in capital. We estimate the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year on an interim basis. The estimated effective tax rate contemplates the expected jurisdiction where income is earned (e.g., United States compared to non United States) as well as tax planning strategies. If the actual results are different from these estimates, adjustments to the effective tax rate may be required in the period such determination is made. Additionally, discrete items are treated separately from the effective rate analysis and are recorded separately as an income tax provision or benefit at the time they are recognized. Page 37 Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes the major elements of our working capital as of October 30, 2009 and October 31, 2008, respectively: October 30, October 31, In millions 2009 2008 Accounts receivable $ 580.6 $ 632.2 Inventories 769.8 805.2 Other current assets 127.9 99.2 Short term notes payable, including current portion of long term obligations (19.8 ) (26.5 ) Accounts payable (206.8 ) (291.8 ) Employee compensation and benefits (116.2 ) (110.0 ) Advance payments and progress billings (321.6 ) (491.7 ) Accrued warranties (58.9 ) (46.6 ) Other accrued liabilities (203.5 ) (173.8 ) Working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents 551.5 396.2 Cash and cash equivalents 471.7 201.6 Working Capital $ 1,023.2 $ 597.8 We currently use working capital and cash flow production as two financial measurements to evaluate the performance of our operations and our ability to meet our financial obligations. We require working capital investment to maintain our position as a leading manufacturer and servicer of high productivity mining equipment with the primary drivers of these requirements being production and replacement parts inventories. As part of our continuous improvement of purchasing and manufacturing processes, we continue to strive for alignment of inventory levels with customer demand and current production schedules. Cash provided by operations for fiscal 2009 was $452.0 million as compared to $577.3 million provided by operations for fiscal 2008. Cash used from decreases in customer advance payments and accounts payable were partially offset by cash generated by reductions in accounts receivable and inventories. The decrease in advance payments was due to original equipment shipments in excess of bookings, and the decrease in accounts payable resulted from lower material receipts. Accounts receivable and inventories were down as working capital management processes continue to be improved. Cash used by investment activities for fiscal 2009 was $104.0 million as compared to $328.7 million used by investment activities for fiscal 2008. Cash used by investment activities for fiscal 2009 was driven by $94.1 million of capital expenditures, mainly consisting of upgrading our facilities and machine tools. During fiscal 2009, our wholly owned subsidiary, China Mining Machinery Group SRL, acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Wuxi Shengda Machinery Co., Ltd., a Chinese manufacturer of longwall shearing machines. Cash used by investment activities in fiscal 2008 was primarily due to the $252.1 million acquisition of Continental. Capital expenditures were $84.2 million and primarily related to the upgrade of existing facilities, machines tools related to the Tianjin facility, further SAP implementations, and other projects. Page 38 Continental Acquisition On February 14, 2008 we completed the acquisition of N.E.S. Investment Co. (Parent) and thereby its subsidiary, Continental Global Group, Inc. a worldwide leader in conveyor systems for bulk material handling in mining and industrial applications. The Continental acquisition further strengthened our ability to provide a more complete mining solution to our customers. We purchased all of the outstanding shares of the Parent for an aggregate amount of $252.1 million, which was net of approximately $5.9 million of indebtedness we assumed at closing and $12.0 million of cash acquired. We also incurred $2.4 million of direct acquisition costs related to the acquisition. The purchase price was funded in part through available cash and credit resources and a new $175.0 million term loan supplement to our existing Credit Agreement (Second Amendment), as discussed below. Cash used by financing activities for fiscal 2009 was $107.6 million as compared to $180.6 million used by financing activities for fiscal 2008. Cash used by financing activities for fiscal 2009 mainly consisted of the payment of dividends. The cash used by financing activities for fiscal 2008 primarily consisted of the repurchase of outstanding stock of $307.7 million and the payment of dividends, offset by the increase of $160.9 million outstanding on our term loan supplement under the revolving credit facility. We expect fiscal 2010 capital spending to be between $90 to $100 million. Capital projects will be monitored to ensure alignment with customer needs and prevailing economic conditions. In addition to capital expenditures for the repair, replacement, and upgrading of existing facilities, we have debt service requirements, including quarterly principal payments on our term loan, commitment and letter of credit fees under our revolving credit facility and biannual interest payments due to holders of our Senior Notes issued in November 2006. We also have a net unfunded pension and other post retirement liability which we expect to contribute $70 to $100 million in fiscal 2010. In order to address these liquidity needs we have: $471.7 million of cash and cash equivalents at October 30, 2009, of which $305.2 million is held outside of the United States $243.9 million available under our unsecured revolving credit facility $1.5 billion of backlog at October 30, 2009, of which 85% 90% is expected to be recognized as revenue in fiscal 2010 Investment grade credit ratings by both Moodys and Standard and Poors We believe that cash generated from operations, together with borrowings available under our credit facility, provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our operating requirements, including pension contributions, debt service requirements and planned capital expenditures. The long term fundamentals of the commodity cycle remain positive, however, near term softness will require continuous reevaluation of new projects to ensure that we are effectively allocating resources in line with current market conditions. Credit Facilities We have a $400.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (Credit Agreement) which expires November 10, 2011. Outstanding borrowings bear interest equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) Rate (defined as applicable LIBOR rate for the equivalent interest period plus 0.5% to 1.25%) or the Base Rate (defined as the higher of the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5%) at our option. We pay a commitment fee ranging from 0.125% to 0.25% on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility based on our credit rating. The Credit Agreement requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants including leverage and interest coverage. The Credit Agreement also restricts payments of dividends or other return of capital based on the consolidated leverage ratio. At October 30, 2009, we were in compliance with all financial covenants in the Credit Agreement and had no restrictions on the payment of dividends or return of capital. At October 30, 2009, there were no direct borrowings under the Credit Agreement. Outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement, which count toward the $400.0 million credit limit, totaled $156.1 million. At October 30, 2009, there was $243.9 million available for borrowings under the Credit Agreement. The Continental acquisition was funded in part through a new $175.0 million term loan supplement to our existing Credit Agreement (the Second Amendment). The Second Amendment calls for quarterly principal payments of 2.5% of the initial term loan through October 31, 2011, at which time the remaining outstanding principal equal to 62.5% of the initial term loan is due. As of October 30, 2009, $144.4 million is outstanding on the term loan. Outstanding borrowings bear interest equal to the LIBOR rate which has a weighted average interest rate of 0.91%. As part of the Second Amendment, we have the option to request an increase to the term loan outstanding not to exceed $75.0 million. No changes were made to existing financial covenants. Page 39 In November 2006, we issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.0% Senior Notes due 2016 and $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.625% Senior Notes due 2036 (Notes) with interest on the Notes being paid semi annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, starting on May 15, 2007. The Notes are guaranteed by each of our current and future significant domestic subsidiaries. The Notes were issued in a private placement under an exemption from registration provided by the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), as amended. In the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the Notes were exchanged for similar notes registered under the Securities Act. At our option, we may redeem some or all of the Notes at a redemption price of the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the principal amounts and the remaining scheduled interest payments using a discount rate equal to the sum of a treasury rate of a comparable treasury issue plus 0.3% for the 2016 Notes and 0.375% for the 2036 Notes. Credit Rating Our credit rating by both Standard and Poors and Moodys has remained consistent in fiscal 2009. Standard and Poors credit rating is BBB with an outlook of Stable. Moodys credit rating is Baa3 with a continued outlook of Stable. These investment grade credit ratings provide us with greater flexibility to access financing on the open market as our business circumstances justify. Advance Payments and Progress Billings As part of the negotiation process associated with original equipment orders, there are generally advance payments obtained from our customers to support the procurement of inventory and other resources. As of October 30, 2009, advance payments and progress billings were $321.6 million. As orders are shipped or costs incurred, the advanced payments and progress billings are reclassified to revenue on the consolidated income statement. Retiree Benefits We sponsor pension plans in both the U.S. and other countries. The significance of the funding requirements of these plans are largely dependent on the actual value of the plan assets, the investment returns on the plan assets, actuarial assumptions, including discount rates and most importantly, the impact of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). During fiscal 2009, we contributed $26.8 million to our worldwide pension plans compared to $58.7 million during fiscal 2008. We expect to make contributions of between $70 to $100 million to our U.S. plans and Non U.S. plans in fiscal 2010. Stock Repurchase Program Under our share repurchase program, management is authorized to repurchase up to $2.0 billion in shares of common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions until December 31, 2011. During fiscal 2009 and 2008, we have repurchased approximately $13.7 million of common stock representing 608,720 shares and $307.7 million of common stock representing 6,040,727 shares. Given the current economic environment, we have set a priority for cash accumulation ahead of other discretionary uses of cash, including share repurchases, until either target cash reserves are established or until there is greater clarity in the market outlook. . Page 40 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We lease various assets under operating leases. The aggregate payments under operating leases as of October 30, 2009 are disclosed in the table of Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments below. No significant changes to lease commitments have occurred during fiscal 2009. We have no other off balance sheet arrangements.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Volatility in interest rates, commodity price risk, and foreign exchange rates can impact our earnings, equity, and cash flow. From time to time we undertake transactions to hedge this impact. Under generally accepted accounting principles, a hedge instrument is considered effective if it offsets partially or completely the impact on earnings, equity, and cash flow due to fluctuations in interest, commodity, and foreign exchange rates. In accordance with our policy, we do not execute derivatives that are speculative or that increase our risk from interest rate, commodity price, or foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long term debt obligations. The interest rate environment causes volatility in our variable rate borrowings and affects the value of our fixed rate debt. We manage this risk through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate debt (See Note 4 Borrowings and Credit Facilities). At October 30, 2009 we were not party to any interest rate derivative contracts. Commodity Price Risk We purchase certain raw materials, including steel and copper, which are subject to price volatility caused by systematic risks. Although future movements in raw material prices are unpredictable, we manage this risk through periodic purchases of raw materials and passing on some or all of the price increases to our customers. At October 30, 2009, we were not a party to any commodity forward contracts. Page 41 Foreign Currency Risk Most of our foreign subsidiaries use local currencies as their functional currency. For consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities are translated at month end exchange rates. Items of income and expense are translated at average exchange rates. Translation gains and losses are not included in determining net income (loss) but are accumulated as a separate component of shareholders equity. Gains (losses) arising from foreign currency transactions are included in determining net income (loss). During fiscal 2009, we realized a gain of $.4 million arising from foreign currency transactions. Foreign exchange derivatives at October 30, 2009 were in the form of forward exchange contracts executed over the counter. There is a concentration of these contracts held with Bank of America, N.A. which maintains an investment grade rating. We have a risk averse Foreign Exchange Risk Management Policy under which significant exposures that impact earnings and cash flows are fully hedged. Exposures that impact only equity or do not have a cash flow impact are generally not hedged with derivatives. We hedge two categories of foreign exchange exposures: assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency, which include future committed receipts or payments denominated in a foreign currency and certain U.S. functional currency entity balance sheet accounts denominated in local currencies. These exposures normally arise from imports and exports of goods and from intercompany trade and lending activity. The fair value of our forward exchange contracts at October 30, 2009 is analyzed in the following table of dollar equivalent terms: Fair Value In thousands Buy Sell Australian Dollar $ 1,391 $ 16 Brazilian Real (32 ) 91 British Pound Sterling (2,830 ) 186 Canadian Dollar (222 ) Chilean Peso 684 (5,082 ) Chinese Yuan (366 ) Euro (46 ) 160 Hungarian Forint (25 ) 4 Indian Rupee 81 (7 ) Polish Zloty (87 ) 8 Russian Ruble (335 ) South African Rand 649 20 U.S. Dollar (715 ) 1,541 Total $ (1,518 ) $ (3,398 ) The following tables present our forward exchange contract balances with an aggregate notional amount greater than $5.0 million.
