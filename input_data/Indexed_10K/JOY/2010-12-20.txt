Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes. References made to years are for fiscal year periods. Dollar amounts are in thousands, except share and per share data and as indicated. The purpose of this discussion and analysis is to enhance the understanding and evaluation of the results of operations, financial position, cash flows, indebtedness, and other key financial information of Joy Global Inc. and its subsidiaries for 2010, 2009, and 2008. For a more complete understanding of this discussion, please read the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. Overview We have been manufacturing mining equipment for over 125 years. We operate in two business segments: Underground Mining Machinery, comprised of our Joy Mining Machinery business and Surface Mining Equipment, comprised of our P&H Mining Equipment business. Joy is a leading producer of high productivity underground mining equipment used primarily for the extraction of coal. P&H is the worlds largest producer of high productivity electric mining shovels and a major producer of walking draglines and large rotary blasthole drills, used primarily for surface mining of copper, coal, iron ore, oil sands, and other minerals. In addition to selling original equipment, we provide parts, components, repairs, rebuilds, diagnostic analysis, training, and other aftermarket services for our installed base of machines. In the case of Surface Mining Equipment, we also provide aftermarket services for equipment manufactured by other companies, including manufacturers with which we have ongoing relationships and which we refer to as Alliance Partners. We emphasize our aftermarket products and services as an integral part of lowering our customers cost per unit of production and are focused on continuing to grow this part of our business. Operating Results Bookings for 2010 were $3.9 billion, an increase of 39% from $2.8 billion, excluding $250.9 million and $63.2 million of order cancellations for original equipment and aftermarket parts and service, respectively, in 2009. The 2010 bookings included the $108.9 million favorable effect of foreign currency translation. The increase in bookings consisted of a $708.6 million increase in original equipment and $385.7 million increase in aftermarket parts and service. The increase in both original equipment and aftermarket orders reflects our customers commitment to both brown field and green field projects as the global demand for commodities continues to increase, most significantly in emerging markets. Net sales for 2010 totaled $3.5 billion, compared with $3.6 billion in 2009, and included a $138.5 million favorable effect of foreign currency translation. The decrease in net sales was the result of a $201.6 million decrease in original equipment shipments, partially offset by $127.6 million increase in aftermarket parts and service. In 2009, shipments increased on declining order rates as we reduced backlog while meeting scheduled delivery dates. Net sales for the underground equipment business decreased by 6.7% in 2010 compared to 2009, while net sales for the surface mining equipment business increased by 4.0%. Operating income was $697.1 million in 2010, compared to $702.3 million in 2009 and included a $20.9 million favorable effect of foreign currency translation. The decrease in operating income was primarily the result of decreased sales volumes and increased retiree benefit costs of $36.1 million. These unfavorable items were partially offset by favorable pricing realization and the mix of products sold, decreased material input costs and elimination of severance and related expenses of $14.4 million recorded in 2009. Net income was $461.5 million or $4.40 per diluted share in 2010, compared with $454.7 million or $4.41 per diluted share in 2009. Page 25 Index Market Outlook The commodity end markets have strong fundamentals and a positive outlook despite slow economic recovery in the industrialized countries and slower growth in the emerging markets, particularly China, which results from efforts to balance economic growth while containing inflation. After recovering beginning in the second half of 2009 and continuing into 2010, copper demand hit an all time high in June of 2010 and continues to run well above its prior five year range. This was not driven by China alone, and in fact, China demand has leveled from 2009 while demand from the rest of the world has increased significantly since the beginning of 2010. Copper prices have moved steadily up during 2010 in response to both increasing demand and limited capacity to expand mine production in the near term. The longer term outlook is further impacted by the continued trend of declining ore grades. The seaborne demand for both thermal and metallurgical coal continues to be driven by China, India, and the other emerging markets. China continues to import coal at an annualized rate of more than 140.0 million metric tons, up from imports of 104.0 million metric tons last year. India also continues to import more coal, with its imports expected to triple during the next five years. In addition to emerging market demand, coal burn has been increasing in Europe and stockpiles there have been drawn down. Seaborne thermal coal prices have been increasing on the projection that continued demand growth from the emerging markets will keep supply under pressure. U. S. coal production year to date is flat with last year, but with an improving trend in more recent months. Based on the recent trend, coal demand is on pace to recover from last year. In addition, the favorable U.S. dollar exchange rate is increasing export opportunities for both thermal and metallurgical coal. U.S. coal production has been restricted by safety and permitting issues and is mostly flat while demand continues to improve. This has resulted in increasing prices across all regions since the first of this year. Similar to copper, global demand in 2010 for iron ore and metallurgical coal has come mostly from increases in steel production outside of China. Prices for both metallurgical coal and iron ore have been rising in recent months and should see continued upward pressure as demand growth resumes from the emerging markets. China has started to relax power rationing in the major steel making province of Hebei, and this resulted in steel production increases in October. In addition, Indias imports of metallurgical and thermal coal are expected to rebound after weather related slowing. Inventories in the industrial sector of the developed countries were substantially reduced during 2009 as companies adjusted to lower demand volumes, and the replenishment of those inventories will add further upside to commodity demand as economic recovery continues. In addition, China and India have included significant infrastructure programs in their next five year plans. India plans to spend $350.0 billion over the next three years for infrastructure projects. A major focus will be on power generation, with capacity additions expected to double by 2012. Chinas plan focuses on the development of the western provinces and on second and third tier cities. Fixed asset investment is targeted to gro w at 20% per year and includes the build out of the electricity grid in the western provinces, which alone could add a million tons to annual copper demand. Based on this outlook, mining companies are realizing strong demand and prices, with the expectation of significant increases in demand during the next 3 to 5 years. As a result, they are making major increases in their capital expenditures for mine expansions. Mining companies have announced capital expenditures that are up 30% to 35% this year, and are approaching the levels of 2008. In addition, announced capital expenditures for 2011 are expected to rise another 15% to 20%. Company Outlook Our outlook is defined by increases in mine production rates as the end use demand for commodities continues to improve and by significant increases in mining company capital budgets as they begin expansion programs to meet higher levels of future demand. Our order rates for original equipment are correlated with the growth in mining company capital expenditures, and therefore the increase in mining company capital budgets provides a strong outlook for mining equipment. Mining companies are transitioning their focus from expanding existing mine capacity to adding major new mines, or from brown field to green field projects, as a major part of their increased capital expenditures. The green field projects are generally larger, and often involve multiple machines, and this is increasing the list of quali fied machine prospects that we track. This list has been increasing during the year, and continued the upward trend in the fourth quarter. Green field projects have longer lead times, and are unlikely to start reaching equipment decisions until later in 2011. The transition from brown field to green field projects could constrain order rate growth over the next couple of quarters. Page 26 Index We are increasing our production schedules to keep pace with growing customer demand. Based on both market fundamentals and the discussions directly with our customers, we are confident that this is the early stage of another multi year expansion of the mining industry. Therefore we are also stepping up our own capital spending to ensure we will have the machines that our customers will need in their expansion programs. More importantly, we want to get this capacity in as early as possible to enable its utilization as industry growth unfolds. The following represents regions or countries included in our discussion within the Underground Mining Machinery Segment: Name Countries/Regions Eurasia Europe, Russia and India Australasia Australia and Indonesia Americas North and South America China China South Africa South Africa Results of Operations 2010 Compared with 2009 Sales The following table sets forth 2010 and 2009 net sales as derived from our Consolidated Statement of Income: $ % In thousands 2010 2009 Change Change Net Sales Underground Mining Machinery $ 2,126,788 $ 2,278,691 $ (151,903 ) (6.7 %) Surface Mining Equipment 1,518,605 1,460,445 58,160 4.0 % Eliminations (121,059 ) (140,822 ) 19,763 Total $ 3,524,334 $ 3,598,314 $ (73,980 ) (2.1 %) Underground Mining Machinery net sales for 2010 were $2.1 billion compared to $2.3 billion for 2009, and included a $223.2 million decrease in original equipment sales, partially offset by a $71.3 million increase in aftermarket sales. Net sales in 2010 increased by $92.9 million due to the effect of foreign currency translation. Original equipment sales decreased by $182.8 million in the United States and $61.5 million in Australasia, primarily due to decreased longwall equipment shipments in both regions. Original equipment sales also decreased in South Africa by $112.9 million, primarily due to decreased room and pillar and longwall mining equipment shipments. These decreases were partially offset by a $115.8 million increase in original equipment sales, primarily of longwall equipment, in China. Aftermarket sales were up in all regions, but most significantly in South Africa, primarily due to complete machine rebuilds. Page 27 Index Surface Mining Equipment net sales for 2010 were $1.52 billion compared to $1.46 billion for 2009, and included a $63.9 million increase in aftermarket sales, partially offset by a $5.7 million decrease in original equipment sales. Net sales in 2010 increased by $45.6 million due to the effect of foreign currency translation. The decrease in original equipment was primarily due to decreased electric mining shovel and drill sales and decreased crushing and conveying equipment sales, which were partially offset by increased alliance sales. The increase in aftermarket sales was primarily related to increased repair and rebuilds in all regions, with the exception of emerging markets. Operating Income The following table sets forth 2010 and 2009 operating income as derived from our Consolidated Statement of Income: 2010 2009 Operating % Operating % In thousands Income (loss) of Net Sales Income (loss) of Net Sales Operating income (loss): Underground Mining Machinery $ 433,902 20.4 % $ 461,019 20.2 % Surface Mining Equipment 336,236 22.1 % 322,170 22.1 % Corporate Expense (43,126 ) (41,759 ) Eliminations (29,909 ) (39,118 ) Total $ 697,103 19.8 % $ 702,312 19.5 % Operating income for Underground Mining Machinery was $433.9 million in 2010, compared to operating income of $461.0 million in 2009. Operating income was favorably impacted in 2010 by $18.5 million due to the effect of foreign currency translation. Operating income was unfavorably impacted by $46.7 million associated with lower sales volumes, $22.1 million of increased retiree benefit expense, $9.0 million of warranty and performance penalties and $5.8 million of product expense, primarily made up of research & development costs. Partially offsetting these decreases in operating income were higher margins related to price realization and the mix of products sold, favorable material input costs, and the benefit of prior year cost reduction programs. Operating income in 2009 was reduced b y $9.0 million for severance and related expenses not repeated in 2010. Operating income for Surface Mining Equipment was $336.2 million in 2010, compared to operating income of $322.2 million in 2009. Operating income was favorably impacted in 2010 by $2.5 million due to the effect of foreign currency translation. Operating income was favorably impacted by higher sales volumes, favorable material input costs of $7.1 million, and the benefit of prior year cost reduction programs. These increases were partially offset by $11.4 million of increased retiree benefit expense. In addition, cancellation income of $8.5 million was recorded in 2009 and not repeated in 2010. Product Development, Selling and Administrative Expense Product development, selling and administrative expense was $480.6 million, or 14% of sales, in 2010, compared to $454.5 million, or 13% of sales, in 2009. These expenses were unfavorably impacted by $17.8 million due to the effect of the foreign currency translation. Product development, selling and administrative expense increased in 2010 due to $22.4 million of increased retiree benefit costs and $7.2 million of increased performance based compensation, partially offset by the benefit of cost saving initiatives implemented in 2009. Administrative expense also included increased severance and related expenses of $14.4 million in 2009 that was not repeated in 2010. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense was $16.8 million in 2010, compared to $24.7 million in 2009. Net interest expense decreased primarily due to interest earned on increased cash and cash equivalents. Page 28 Index Provision for Income Taxes Income tax expense was $217.5 million in 2010, with an effective tax rate of 32.0%, compared to income tax expense of $228.0 million in 2009, with an effective tax rate of 33.4%. The main drivers of the variance in tax rates when compared to the statutory rate of 35.0% were the geographic mix of earnings and the utilization of tax credits and tax holidays offset by increased state income taxes and establishment of valuation reserves. A net discrete tax benefit of $3.4 million was recorded in 2010, compared to net discrete tax expense of $8.2 million in 2009. A review of uncertain income tax positions was performed throughout 2010 and 2009 and a net benefit of $4.4 million and $1.8 million, respectively, was recorded. 2009 Compared with 2008 Sales The following table sets forth 2009 and 2008 net sales as derived from our Consolidated Statement of Income: $ % In thousands 2009 2008 Change Change Net Sales Underground Mining Machinery $ 2,278,691 $ 2,001,166 $ 277,525 13.9 % Surface Mining Equipment 1,460,445 1,540,987 (80,542 ) (5.2 %) Eliminations (140,822 ) (123,219 ) (17,603 ) Total $ 3,598,314 $ 3,418,934 $ 179,380 5.2 % Underground Mining Machinery net sales for 2009 were $2.3 billion compared to $2.0 billion for 2008, which included a $255.3 million increase in original equipment sales and a $22.2 million increase in aftermarket sales. 2009 net sales decreased by $125.1 million due to the effect of foreign currency translation. Original equipment sales in the Americas increased by $194.6 million primarily as a result of increased sales of room and pillar application equipment and roof supports used in longwall system applications. Original equipment sales also increased in South Africa by $111.0 million due to increased demand for equipment used in both room and pillar and longwall applications and by $66.6 million associated with increased crushing an d conveying equipment sales primarily due to the Continental acquisition made on February 14, 2008. Therefore 2008 only included eight and one half months of the Continental net sales. Original equipment sales decreased by $74.9 million in Eurasia primarily due to decreased roof support sales, while original equipment sales in China decreased by $43.8 million primarily due to lower continuous miner and armored face conveyor sales. Aftermarket sales were flat or slightly down in all markets with the exception of the United States. Surface Mining Equipment net sales for 2009 were $1.5 billion which included a $43.9 million decrease in original equipment sales and a $36.7 million decrease in aftermarket sales. 2009 net sales decreased by $36.2 million due to the effect of foreign currency translation. Original equipment sales, primarily consisting of electric mining shovel sales, decreased in China and Canada, partially offset by increased sales in the United States and Australia. Reduced production activity by our customers translated into lower aftermarket products and service revenues with decreased sales of $63.4 million in the United States, partially offset by increased sales of $25.4 million and $22.7 million in Chile and Canada, respectively. Page 29 Index Operating Income The following table sets forth 2009 and 2008 operating income as derived from our Consolidated Statement of Income: 2009 2008 Operating % Operating % In thousands Income (loss) of Net Sales Income (loss) of Net Sales Operating income (loss): Underground Mining Machinery $ 461,019 20.2 % $ 364,747 18.2 % Surface Mining Equipment 322,170 22.1 % 250,093 16.2 % Corporate Expense (41,759 ) (34,897 ) Eliminations (39,118 ) (28,739 ) Total $ 702,312 19.5 % $ 551,204 16.1 % Operating income for Underground Mining Machinery was $461.0 million in 2009, compared to $364.7 million in 2008. Operating income was unfavorably impacted in 2009 by $26.7 million due to the effect of foreign currency translation. Operating income was favorably impacted in 2009 by $72.0 million of increased sales and improved price realization, $13.5 million of decreased purchase accounting related to the conveying business, lower material costs, spending control measures and the benefits associated with operating excellence initiatives, and inclusion of the conveyor business for all of 2009 as compared to eight and a half months in fiscal 2008. These increases were partially offset by the cost incurred in connection with various cost reduction actions and the effect of a higher mix of original equipm ent. Operating income for Surface Mining Equipment was $322.2 million in 2009, compared to $250.1 million in 2008. The increase in operating income was primarily due to favorable price realization, reduced material costs, spending control measures, and $8.5 million of cancellation income. In addition, 2008 operating income was unfavorably impacted by a $22.7 million charge for the cancellation of a maintenance and repair contract in Australia and a $5.5 million charge for retiree benefit costs associated with the execution of the Steelworkers agreement in Milwaukee. Corporate expense increased by $6.9 million primarily due to increased professional service fees, recruiting and relocation fees associated with the filling of senior management positions, and an increase in equity incentive based performance compensation. Product Development, Selling and Administrative Expense Product development, selling and administrative expense was $454.5 million, or 13% of sales, in 2009, as compared to $441.5 million, or 13% of sales, in 2008. The increase in product development, selling and administrative expense was primarily due to $14.4 million of severance and other related expense associated with various cost reduction initiatives implemented during 2009. The increase in corporate expense outlined previously and general inflationary increases were offset by the favorable impact of $23.7 million due to foreign currency translation and the spending controls put in place. Provision for Income Taxes Income tax expense for 2009 was $228.0 million, compared to income tax expense of $154.0 million in 2008. The effective income tax rates from continuing operations were 33.4% and 29.2%, for 2009 and 2008, respectively. The main drivers of the variance in tax rates when compared to the statutory rate of 35% were the geographic mix of earnings with the corresponding net favorable differences in foreign statutory tax rates and the utilization of tax credits and tax holidays offset by increased state income taxes and tax account corrections. Page 30 Index A net discrete tax expense of $8.2 million was recorded in 2009, as compared to a net discrete tax benefit of $10.4 million in 2008. A review of uncertain income tax positions was performed throughout 2009 and 2008 as part of the overall income tax provision and a net benefit of $1.8 million and $3.5 million, respectively, was recorded on a global basis. Reorganization Items Reorganization items include income, expenses, and losses that were realized or incurred by the Predecessor Company as a result of its decision to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Net reorganization items for 2010, 2009, and 2008 consisted of the following: In thousands 2010 2009 2008 Beloit U.K. claim settlement $ $ $ (2,055 ) Beloit U.K. receivership settlement 5,665 Professional fees directly related to the reorganization and other (1,310 ) (605 ) (364 ) Net reorganization (expense) income $ (1,310 ) $ 5,060 $ (2,419 ) Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to bad debts, excess inventory, warranty, intangible assets, income taxes, and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be re asonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the accounting policies described below are the policies that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments, and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results of operations. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue on aftermarket products and services when the following criteria are satisfied: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, product delivery and title transfer has occurred or the services have been rendered, the price is fixed and determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue on long term contracts, such as for the manufacture of mining shovels, drills, draglines, roof support systems and conveyor systems, using the percentage of completion method. We generally recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method for original equipment. When using the percentage of completion method, sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion.&#160 ; Sales and gross profit are adjusted prospectively for revisions in estimated total contract costs and contract values. Estimated losses are recognized in full when identified. Approximately 87% of our sales in 2010 were recorded at the time of shipment of the product or delivery of the service, with the remaining 13% of sales recorded using percentage of completion accounting. We have life cycle management contracts with customers to supply parts and service for terms of 1 to 13 years. These contracts are established based on the conditions the equipment will be operating in, the time horizon that the program will cover, and the expected operating cycle that will be required for the equipment. Based on this information, a model is created representing the projected costs and revenues of servicing the respective machines over the specified contract terms. Accounting for these contracts requires us to make various estimates, including estimates of the relevant machines long term maintenance requirements. Under these contracts, customers are generally billed monthly based on hours of operation or units of production achieved by the equipment, with the respecti ve deferred revenues recorded when billed. Revenue is recognized in the period in which parts are supplied or services provided. These contracts are reviewed quarterly by comparison of actual results to original estimates or most recent analysis, with revenue recognition adjusted appropriately for future estimated costs. If a loss is expected at any time, the full amount of the loss is recognized immediately. Page 31 Index We have certain customer agreements that are multiple element arrangements as defined by the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 605 25 Multiple Element Arrangements. The agreements are assessed for multiple elements based on the following criteria: the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis, there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item, and the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor. Revenue is then allocated to each identified unit of accounting based on our estimate of their relative fair values. Revenue recognition involves judgments, including assessments of expected returns, the likelihood of nonpayment, and estimates of expected costs and profits on long term contracts. We analyze various factors, including a review of specific transactions, historical experience, credit worthiness of customers, and current market and economic conditions, in determining when to recognize revenue. Changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized with a resulting impact on the timing and amount of associated income. Inventories Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first in, first out method for all inventories. We evaluate the need to record valuation adjustments for inventory on a regular basis. Our policy is to evaluate all inventories including raw material, work in process, finished goods, and spare parts. Inventory in excess of our estimated usage requirements is written down to its estimated net realizable value. Inherent in the estimates of net realizable value are estimates related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, possible alternative uses, and ultimate realization of potentially excess inventory. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Intangible assets include drawings, patents, trademarks, technology, customer relationships and other specifically identifiable assets. Indefinite lived intangible assets are not being amortized. Indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes occur that suggest impairment in carrying value, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate. As part of the impairment analysis, we use the discounted cash flow model based on royalties estimated to be derived in the future use of the asset were we to license the use of the trademark or tradename. No impairment was identified as part of our fourth quarter impairment testing of our indefinite lived intangible assets. Finite lived intangible assets are amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed, which is principally the straight line method. Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment if events or changes occur that suggest impairment in carrying value. No impairment was identified related to our finite lived intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is assigned to specific reporting units, which we have identified as our operating segments, and tested for impairment at least annually, during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that a reporting units carrying amount is greater than its fair value. Goodwill is tested for impairment using the two step approach, in accordance with ASC No. 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other. The determination of an impairment requires the valuation of the respective reporting unit, which we estimate using the discounted cash flow model and market approach. The discounted cash flow model involves many assumptions, including operating results forecasts and discount rates. Inherent in the operating results forecasts are certain assumptions regarding revenue growth rates, projected cost saving initiatives and projected long term growth rates in the determination of terminal values. We performed our goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2010 and no impairment was identified. A one percentage point increase in the discount rate used to determine the fair value of the reporting units would not cause the carrying value of the respective reporting unit to exceed its fair value. Page 32 Index Accrued Warranties We record accruals for potential warranty claims based on prior claim experience. Warranty costs are accrued at the time revenue is recognized. These warranty costs are based upon managements assessment of past claims and current experience. However, actual claims could be higher or lower than amounts estimated, as the amount and value of warranty claims are subject to variation as a result of many factors that cannot be predicted with certainty. Pension and Postretirement Benefits and Costs Pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. The primary assumptions include factors such as discount rates, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates and rate of compensation increases, discussed below: Discount rates: We generally estimate the discount rate for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations using a process based on a hypothetical investment in a portfolio of high quality bonds that approximate the estimated cash flows of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. We believe this approach permits a matching of future cash outflows related to benefit payments with future cash inflows associated with bond coupons and maturities. Expected return on plan assets: Our expected return on plan assets is derived from reviews of asset allocation strategies and anticipated future long term performance of individual asset classes. Our analysis gives appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns; however, the assumptions are primarily based on long term, prospective rates of return. Mortality rates: Mortality rates are based on the RP 2000 mortality table. Rate of compensation increase: The rate of compensation increase reflects our long term actual experience and its outlook, including consideration of expected rates of inflation. Actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods, and therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement plan obligations and future expense. Future changes affecting the above assumptions will change the related pension benefit or expense. As such, a 0.25% change in the discount rate and rate of return on net assets would have the following effects on projected benefit obligation and pension expense, respectively, as of and for the fiscal year ended October 29, 2010: 0.25% Increase 0.25% Decrease Expected Expected Discount long term Discount long term In thousands rate rate of return rate rate of return U.S Pension Plans: Net pension expense $ (2,545 ) $ (1,628 ) $ 2,573 $ 1,628 Projected benefit obligation $ (29,442 ) $ $ 30,321 $ Non U.S. Pension Plans: Net pension expense $ (1,634 ) $ (1,124 ) $ 1,652 $ 1,124 Projected benefit obligation $ (17,948 ) $ $ 18,556 $ Other Postretirement Benefit Plans: Net pension expense $ (26 ) $ (7 ) $ 30 $ 7 Projected benefit obligation $ (515 ) $ $ 525 $ Page 33 Index Income Taxes Deferred taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using statutory tax rates. Deferred income tax provisions are based on changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities from period to period. Additionally, we analyze our ability to recognize the net deferred tax assets created in each jurisdiction in which we operate to determine if valuation allowances are necessary based on the more likely than not criteria. As required under the application of fresh start accounting, the release of pre emergence tax valuation reserves was not recorded in the income statement but instead was treated first as a reduction of excess reorganization value until exhausted, then intangibles until exhausted, and thereafter reported as additional paid in capital. Consequently, a net tax charge will be incurred in future years when these tax assets are utilized. We will continue to monitor the appropriateness of the existing valuation allowances and determine annually the amount of valuation allowances that are required to be maintained. As of October 29, 2010, there were $68.8 million of valuation allowances against pre emergence net operating loss carryforwards. All future reversals of pre emergence valuation allowances will be recorded to additional paid in capital. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes the major elements of our working capital as of: In millions October 29, 2010 October 30, 2009 Accounts receivable $ 674,135 $ 580,629 Inventories 764,945 769,783 Accounts payable (291,742 ) (206,770 ) Advance payments (376,300 ) (321,629 ) Trade Working Capital $ 771,038 $ 822,013 Other current assets 107,266 127,930 Short term notes payable (1,550 ) (19,791 ) Employee compensation and benefits (128,132 ) (116,149 ) Accrued warranties (62,351 ) (58,947 ) Other current liabilities (163,249 ) (203,498 ) Working Capital Excluding Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 523,022 $ 551,558 Cash and Cash Equivalents 815,581 471,685 Working Capital $ 1,338,603 $ 1,023,243 We currently use trade working capital and cash flow from operations as two financial measurements to evaluate the performance of our operations and our ability to meet our financial obligations. We require trade working capital investment because our service model requires us to maintain certain inventory levels in order to maximize our customers machine reliability. This information also provides management with a focus on our receivable terms and collectability efforts and our ability to obtain advance payments on original equipment orders. As part of our continuous improvement of purchasing and manufacturing processes, we continue to strive for alignment of inventory levels with customer demand and current production schedules. Cash provided by operations for 2010 was $583.5 million as compared to $452.0 million provided by operations for 2009. Cash provided by operations was unfavorably impacted by increased contributions to retiree benefit plans of $86.6 million and an increase in accounts receivable primarily due to increased sales in the fourth quarter of 2010. Cash provided by operations was favorably impacted by increased customer advance payments due to original equipment bookings in excess of shipments, and increased accounts payable due to process improvements. Page 34 Index Cash used by investment activities for 2010 was $74.9 million as compared to $104.0 million used by investment activities for 2009. The decrease in cash used by investment activities for 2010 was driven by decreased capital expenditures of $20.6 million due to the delay in restarting capital projects which were put on hold during 2009 and the prior year acquisition of Wuxi Shengda Machinery Co., Ltd., a Chinese manufacturer of longwall shearing machines. Cash used by financing activities for 2010 was $185.1 million as compared to $107.6 million used by financing activities for 2009. The increase in cash used by financing activities for 2010 was driven by the $144.4 million repayment of the term loan in conjunction with execution of the new revolving credit facility, partially offset by the prior year repurchase of outstanding stock of $13.7 million. We expect 2011 capital spending to be approximately $150.0 million. Capital projects will be focused on expanding service center capabilities globally and the increase of our manufacturing capabilities in the emerging markets. In addition to capital expenditures for the repair, replacement, and upgrading of existing facilities, we have commitment and letter of credit fees under our revolving credit facility and biannual interest payments due to holders of our Senior Notes issued in November 2006. We also have a net unfunded pension and other post retirement liability of $461.1 million as of October 29, 2010. In order to address these liquidity needs we have: $815.6 million of cash and cash equivalents at October 29, 2010, of which $358.8 million is held outside of the United States $318.1 million available under our unsecured revolving credit facility $1.8 billion of backlog at October 29, 2010, of which 85% 90% is expected to be recognized as revenue in 2011 Access to credit markets We believe that cash generated from operations, together with cash and cash equivalents and borrowings available under our credit facility, provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our operating requirements, including pension contributions, debt service requirements and planned capital expenditures. Credit Facilities On October 27, 2010 we entered into a $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (Credit Agreement) set to expire on November 3, 2014. We recorded a pre tax charge of $0.3 million related to deferred financing costs associated with the termination of our $400.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that was set to expire on November 10, 2011. Under the terms of the new agreement we pay a commitment fee ranging from 0.25% to 0.5% on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility based on our credit rating. Outstanding borrowings bear interest equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) (defined as applicable LIBOR rate for the equivalent interest period plus 1.75% to 2.75%) or the Base Rate (defined as the highest of the Prime Rate, Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5%, or Eurodollar Rate plus 1.0% ) at our option. The Credit Agreement requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants including leverage and interest coverage ratios. The Credit Agreement also restricts payment of dividends or other return of capital when the consolidated leverage ratio exceeds a stated level. On October 22, 2010, we repaid the $131.3 million remaining balance of the $175.0 million term loan which was used to fund our acquisition of Continental. We recorded a pre tax charge of $0.4 million related to the deferred financing cost on the term loan that was initially due October 31, 2011. At October 29, 2010, there were no direct borrowings under the Credit Agreement. Outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement, which count toward the $500.0 million credit limit, totaled $181.9 million. At October 29, 2010, there was $318.1 million available for borrowings under the Credit Agreement. In November 2006, we issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.0% Senior Notes due 2016 and $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.625% Senior Notes due 2036 (Notes) with interest on the Notes being paid semi annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, starting on May 15, 2007. The Notes are guaranteed by each of our current and future significant domestic subsidiaries. The Notes were issued in a private placement under an exemption from registration provided by the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), as amended. In the second quarter of 2007, the Notes were exchanged for similar notes registered under the Securities Act. At our option, we may rede em some or all of the Notes at a redemption price of the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the principal amounts and the remaining scheduled interest payments using a discount rate equal to the sum of a treasury rate of a comparable treasury issue plus 0.3% for the 2016 Notes and 0.375% for the 2036 Notes. Page 35 Index Advance Payments and Progress Billings As part of the negotiation process associated with original equipment orders, there are generally advance payments obtained from our customers to support the procurement of inventory and other resources. As of October 29, 2010, advance payments and progress billings were $376.3 million. As orders are shipped or costs incurred, the advanced payments and progress billings are reclassified to revenue on the consolidated income statement. Retiree Benefits We sponsor pension plans in both the U.S. and other countries. The significance of the funding requirements of these plans are largely dependent on the actual value of the plan assets, the investment returns on the plan assets, actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, and the impact of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. During 2010, we contributed $117.4 million to our world wide retiree benefit plans compared to $30.8 million during 2009. We expect to make contributions of between $135.0 million to $145.0 million to our U.S. plans and non U.S. plans in 2011. Stock Repurchase Program Under our share repurchase program, management is authorized to repurchase up to $2.0 billion in shares of common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions until December 31, 2011. During 2010 we did not repurchase any shares, but in 2009 and 2008, we repurchased approximately $13.7 million of common stock representing 608,720 shares and $307.7 million of common stock representing 6,040,727 shares, respectively. In the future we will continue to include share repurchases as a discretionary use of cash in combination with our dividend policy and acquisition strategy. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We lease various assets under operating leases. The aggregate payments under operating leases as of October 29, 2010 are disclosed in the table of Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments below. No significant changes to lease commitments have occurred during 2010. We have no other off balance sheet arrangements.

Page 36 Index New Accounting Pronouncements Our new accounting pronouncements are set forth under Item 15 Exhibits and Financial Statements Schedules of this annual report and are incorporated herein by reference. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Volatility in commodity price risk and foreign exchange rates can impact our earnings, equity, and cash flow. From time to time we undertake transactions to hedge this impact. A hedge instrument is considered effective if it offsets partially or completely the impact on earnings, equity, and cash flow due to fluctuations in interest, commodity, and foreign exchange rates. In accordance with our policy, we do not execute derivatives that are speculative or that increase our risk from commodity price or foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Commodity Price Risk We purchase certain raw materials, including steel and copper, that are subject to price volatility caused by systematic risks. Although future movements in raw material prices are unpredictable, we manage this risk through periodic purchases of raw materials and passing some or all price increases to our customers. At October 29, 2010, we were not a party to any commodity forward contracts. Foreign Currency Risk Our significant foreign subsidiaries use local currencies as their functional currency. For consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities are translated at month end exchange rates. Items of income and expense are translated at average exchange rates. Translation gains and losses are not included in determining net income (loss) but are accumulated as a separate component of shareholders equity. Gains (losses) arising from foreign currency transactions are included in determining net income (loss). During 2010, we realized a gain of $5.7 million arising from foreign currency transactions. Foreign exchange derivatives at October 29, 2010 were in the form of forward exchange contracts executed over the counter. There is a concentration of these contract s held with Bank of America, N.A., which maintains an investment grade rating. We have a risk averse Foreign Exchange Risk Management Policy under which significant exposures that impact earnings and cash flows are fully hedged. Exposures that impact only equity or do not have a cash flow impact are generally not hedged with derivatives. We hedge two categories of foreign exchange exposures: assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency, which include future committed receipts or payments denominated in a foreign currency and certain U.S. functional currency entity balance sheet accounts denominated in local currencies. These exposures normally arise from imports and exports of goods and from intercompany trade and lending activity. The fair value of our forward exchange contracts at October 29, 2010 is analyzed in the following table of dollar equivalent terms: Fair Value In thousands Buy Sell Australian Dollar $ 894 $ (102 ) Brazilian Real (488 ) (28 ) British Pound Sterling 609 (49 ) Canadian Dollar 2 Chilean Peso 264 (572 ) Chinese Renminbi 14 Euro 189 (38 ) South African Rand 517 (34 ) U.S. Dollar (1,905 ) 7,158 Total $ 96 $ 6,335 Page 37 Index The following tables present our forward exchange contract balances with an aggregate notional amount greater than $10.0 million.
