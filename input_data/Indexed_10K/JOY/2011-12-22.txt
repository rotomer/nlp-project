Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes. References made to years are for fiscal year periods. Dollar amounts are in thousands, except share and per share data and as indicated. The purpose of this discussion and analysis is to enhance the understanding and evaluation of the results of operations, financial position, cash flows, indebtedness, and other key financial information of Joy Global Inc. and its subsidiaries for 2011, 2010, and 2009. For a more complete understanding of this discussion, please read the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. Overview We have been manufacturing mining equipment for over 125 years. We operate in two business segments: Underground Mining Machinery, comprised of our Joy Mining Machinery business and Surface Mining Equipment, comprised of our P&H Mining Equipment business. Joy is a leading producer of high productivity underground mining machinery for the extraction of coal and other bedded materials. P&H is the worlds largest producer of high productivity electric mining shovels and a major producer of rotary blasthole drills, walking draglines and large wheel loaders used primarily for surface mining of copper, coal, iron ore, oil sands, and other minerals. In addition to selling original equipment, we provide parts, components, repairs, rebuilds, diagnostic analysis, training, and other aftermarket services for our installed base of machines. In the case of Surface Mining Equipment, we also provide aftermarket services for equipment manufactured by other companies, including manufacturers with which we have ongoing relationships and which we refer to as Alliance Partners. We emphasize our aftermarket products and services as an integral part of lowering our customers cost per unit of production and are focused on continuing to grow this part of our business. LeTourneau Technologies, Inc. On June 22, 2011 we acquired LeTourneau Technologies, Inc. for approximately $1.1 billion. We purchased all of the outstanding capital stock and financed the acquisition with cash on hand and borrowings of $500.0 million under a new credit facility. LeTourneau designs, builds and supports equipment for the mining industry and has been a leader in the earthmoving equipment industry since the 1920s. LeTourneau historically operated in three business segments, mining, steel products and drilling products. The mining products business is the worlds leading manufacturer of large wheel loaders for surface mining, providing the industrys largest model sizes and payload capacities. On October 24, 2011 we completed the sale of LeTourneau Technologies Drilling Systems, Inc. to Cameron International Corporation for $375.0 million in cash, subject to a post closing working capital adjustment. In connection with this transaction, the LeTourneau facilities in Houston, Texas and Vicksburg, Mississippi have been sold while the Longview, Texas facility will remain with us. We have entered into a Transition Manufacturing and Supply Agreement to allow for the orderly transfer of drilling products work from Longview and a Steel Supply Agreement to allow the buyer time to develop other sources. In conjunction with our entrance into the Transition Manufacturing and Supply Agreement, we recognized an upfront loss and related liability of $23.3 million for manufacturing costs to be incurred that will not be reimbursed. The results of the drilling products business are included in discontinued operations on the accompanying consolidated statement of income and the assets and liabilities of the drilling products business that either transferred after our fiscal year end or remain our obligation are reflected as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The results of the mining and steel businesses (collectively the mining equipment business) are included in our Surface Mining Equipment segment. From the date of acquisition until our fiscal year end, the mining equipment business of LeTourneau had net sales of $144.9 million and operating income of $23.2 million. 26 Index International Mining Machinery On July 11, 2011 we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (SPA) with TJCC Holdings Limited, a corporation controlled by The Jordan Company, L.P., to acquire 534.8 million shares of common stock, or approximately 41.1%, of IMM, for HK$8.50 per share, or approximately $584.2 million subject to exchange rate fluctuation. IMM is a leading designer and manufacturer of underground coal mining equipment in China. On July 28, 2011, August 16, 2011 and September 2, 2011 we purchased approximately 136.5 million, 102.0 million and 127.2 million shares, respectively, of IMM for a total of $376.7 million. These shares were purchased on the open market and represent approximately 28.1% of the total outstanding shares of IMM. On December 20, 2011, MOFCOM approved the purchase of IMM shares covered by the SPA and the acquisition is expected to close on or around December 30, 2011. At such time, we will have a controlling interest of approximately 69.2% of IMMs outstanding common stock and accordingly will be required under Rule 26.1 of the Hong Kong Takeovers Code to make an unconditional cash tender offer to purchase the remaining outstanding shares and options to purchase shares at a minimum per share purchase price of HK$8.50. If all of the shares and options to purchase shares of IMM common stock are purchased, the aggregate purchase price would be approximately $456.1 million subject to exchange rate fluctuation. We expect that this investment in IMM will strengthen our presence in China and other emerging markets. IMM reported revenues of RMB 1,942 million ($306.3 million) and operating profit of RMB 417 million ($65.8 million) for its most recent fiscal year ending December 31, 2010. During fiscal 2011, our initial investment in IMM was accounted for under the equity method and we recognized estimated income of $3.4 million. Operating Results Bookings for 2011 were $5.6 billion, an increase of 44.3% from the prior year. Original equipment bookings increased $1.2 billion, or 75.1% from the prior year and were driven by electric mining shovel orders for copper in South America and coal in North America and room and pillar orders in the U.S. and longwall systems orders in Australia. Aftermarket bookings increased $522.8 million, or 22.9%, as parts and service orders remain strong across most regions for both the Underground Mining Machinery and Surface Mining Equipment segments. The increase in both original equipment and aftermarket orders reflects continued demand for mining equipment as demand for commodities remains strong. Fiscal year 2011 bookings included a $179.2 million favorable effect of foreign currency translation. Net sales for 2011 totaled $4.4 billion compared to $3.5 billion in 2010. Aftermarket sales increased $520.9 million, or 24.8%, when compared to the prior year on increased parts sales across all regions for both the Underground Mining Machinery and Surface Mining Equipment segments. Original equipment sales increased $358.6 million, or 25.1%, when compared to the prior year primarily on improved sales in the U.S., Australia and South America. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted sales by $109.3 million. Operating income was $920.2 million in 2011, compared to $697.1 million in 2010 and included an $18.7 million favorable effect of foreign currency translation. The increase in operating income was primarily the result of increased sales volumes, positive price realization, and favorable overhead absorption. These items were partially offset by increased product development, selling and administrative expenses. The results of LeTourneaus mining equipment business are included in our Surface Mining Equipment segment. From June 22, 2011 through the end of our fiscal year, LeTourneaus mining equipment business had bookings of $139.4 million, net sales of $144.9 million and operating income of $23.2 million. Operating income was reduced by $12.2 million for purchase accounting charges, of which $7.7 million was attributable to acquired inventories. Net income from continuing operations was $631.0 million or $5.92 per diluted share in 2011 compared to $461.5 million or $4.40 per diluted share in 2010. 27 Index Results of Operations 2011 Compared with 2010 Sales The following table sets forth 2011 and 2010 net sales as derived from our Consolidated Statement of Income: In thousands 2011 2010 $ Change % Change Net Sales Underground Mining Machinery $ 2,576,625 $ 2,126,788 $ 449,837 21.2 % Surface Mining Equipment 1,959,353 1,518,605 440,748 29.0 % Eliminations (132,072 ) (121,059 ) (11,013 ) (9.1 )% Total $ 4,403,906 $ 3,524,334 $ 879,572 25.0 % Underground Mining Machinery net sales for 2011 were $2.6 billion compared to $2.1 billion for 2010, and included a $287.7 million increase in aftermarket sales and a $162.1 million increase in original equipment sales. Aftermarket sales increased across all regions. Specifically, aftermarket sales increased in the U.S. and Australasia by $113.5 million and $55.6 million, respectively, primarily due to the strengthening of the parts and rebuild markets in these regions. Additionally, strong parts demand in China caused aftermarket sales to increase by 56.8%, or $52.1 million. The increase in original equipment sales was led primarily by increased room and pillar sales in both the U.S. and South Africa and by roof support sales for longwall application equipment orders in Australasia. These increases were partially offset by decreased longwall equipment volumes in Eurasia and China. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted sales by $77.4 million. Surface Mining Equipment net sales for 2011 were $2.0 billion compared to $1.5 billion for 2010, which included a $189.2 million increase in aftermarket sales, a $106.6 million increase in original equipment sales and $144.9 million in sales from the mining equipment business of LeTourneau. Aftermarket sales increased across all regions and were led by increased sales in North and South America of $64.5 million and $91.6 million, respectively. Original equipment sales of electric mining shovels and drills increased across all regions, with the exception of North America. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted sales by $31.9 million. Operating Income The following table sets forth 2011 and 2010 operating income as derived from our Consolidated Statement of Income: 2011 2010 In thousands Operating Income (loss) % of Net Sales Operating Income (loss) % of Net Sales Operating income (loss): Underground Mining Machinery $ 595,262 23.1 % $ 433,902 20.4 % Surface Mining Equipment 422,472 21.6 % 336,236 22.1 % Corporate Expense (65,693 ) (43,126 ) Eliminations (31,862 ) (29,909 ) Total $ 920,179 20.9 % $ 697,103 19.8 % 28 Index Operating income for the Underground Mining Machinery segment was $595.3 million in fiscal 2011, compared to operating income of $433.9 million in fiscal 2010. Operating income was favorably impacted by $175.1 million due to higher sales volumes, $52.2 million due to favorable manufacturing overhead absorption and $45.4 million in favorable overall price realization. These increases were partially offset by $67.9 million of unfavorable changes in material price variances due to rising steel costs and other surcharges, $49.4 million of increased product development, selling and administrative expenses and $6.6 million from a prior year foreign currency gain that was not repeated in the current year. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted operating income by $17.9 million. Operating income for the Surface Mining Equipment segment was $422.5 million in fiscal 2011, compared to operating income of $336.2 million in fiscal 2010. Operating income was favorably impacted by $172.4 million due to higher sales volumes, $17.7 million due to favorable manufacturing overhead absorption and $11.3 million of cancellation charges. Operating income in 2011 includes $23.2 million from LeTourneaus mining equipment business which includes purchase accounting charges of $12.2 million. Partially offsetting these increases were $41.1 million of unfavorable changes in material price variances due to rising material costs and surcharges and $48.0 million of increased product development, selling and administrative expense. Corporate expense increased due to acquisition transaction costs of $19.7 million. Product Development, Selling and Administrative Expense Product development, selling and administrative expense was $602.0 million, or 13.7% of sales, in 2011, compared to $480.6 million, or 13.6% of sales, in 2010. Before acquisition transaction costs of $19.7 million in 2011, product development, selling and administrative expenses totaled $582.3 million, or 13.2% of sales. Product development costs increased by $20.8 million, which is attributable to research and development activities on new or existing products and increased personnel for smart services activities. Selling costs increased by $34.0 million due to travel, warehouse costs to support increased parts volumes and the inclusion of $5.6 million from LeTourneaus mining equipment business. Administrative expenses increased primarily due to acquisition transaction costs. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense was $24.3 million in 2011, compared to $16.8 million in 2010. Net interest expense increased as a result of additional borrowings. We entered into a $500.0 million term loan dated June 16, 2011 for the acquisition of LeTourneau and issued $500.0 million of Senior Notes on October 12, 2011 in anticipation of completing the IMM transaction. Provision for Income Taxes Income tax expense for 2011 was $264.8 million, as compared to $217.5 million in 2010. The effective income tax rates from continuing operations were 29.6% and 32.0%, for 2011 and 2010, respectively. The main drivers of the variance in tax rates when compared to the statutory rate of 35% were the geographic mix of earnings with the corresponding net favorable differences in foreign statutory tax rates and the utilization of tax credits and tax holidays, offset by increased state income taxes and the establishment of valuation reserves. A net discrete tax benefit of $5.4 million was recorded in 2011 as compared to a net discrete tax benefit of $3.4 million in 2010. A review of uncertain income tax positions was performed throughout 2011 and 2010 as part of the overall income tax provision and a net benefit of $2.9 million and $4.4 million, respectively, was recorded on a global basis. 29 Index 2010 Compared with 2009 Sales The following table sets forth 2010 and 2009 net sales as derived from our Consolidated Statement of Income: In thousands 2010 2009 $ Change % Change Net Sales Underground Mining Machinery $ 2,126,788 $ 2,278,691 $ (151,903 ) (6.7 %) Surface Mining Equipment 1,518,605 1,460,445 58,160 4.0 % Eliminations (121,059 ) (140,822 ) 19,763 Total $ 3,524,334 $ 3,598,314 $ (73,980 ) (2.1 %) Underground Mining Machinery net sales for 2010 were $2.1 billion compared to $2.3 billion for 2009, and included a $223.2 million decrease in original equipment sales, partially offset by a $71.3 million increase in aftermarket sales. Net sales in 2010 increased by $92.9 million due to the effect of foreign currency translation. Original equipment sales decreased by $182.8 million in the United States and $61.5 million in Australasia, primarily due to decreased longwall equipment shipments in both regions. Original equipment sales also decreased in South Africa by $112.9 million, primarily due to decreased room and pillar and longwall mining equipment shipments. These decreases were partially offset by a $115.8 million increase in original equipment sales, primarily of longwall equipment, in China. Aftermarket sales were up in all regions, but most significantly in South Africa, primarily due to complete machine rebuilds. Surface Mining Equipment net sales for 2010 were $1.52 billion compared to $1.46 billion for 2009, and included a $63.9 million increase in aftermarket sales, partially offset by a $5.7 million decrease in original equipment sales. Net sales in 2010 increased by $45.6 million due to the effect of foreign currency translation. The decrease in original equipment was primarily due to decreased electric mining shovel and drill sales and decreased crushing and conveying equipment sales, which were partially offset by increased alliance sales. The increase in aftermarket sales was primarily related to increased repair and rebuilds in all regions, with the exception of emerging markets. Operating Income The following table sets forth 2010 and 2009 operating income as derived from our Consolidated Statement of Income: 2010 2009 In thousands Operating Income (loss) % of Net Sales Operating Income (loss) % of Net Sales Operating income (loss): Underground Mining Machinery $ 433,902 20.4 % $ 461,019 20.2 % Surface Mining Equipment 336,236 22.1 % 322,170 22.1 % Corporate Expense (43,126 ) (41,759 ) Eliminations (29,909 ) (39,118 ) Total $ 697,103 19.8 % $ 702,312 19.5 % Operating income for Underground Mining Machinery was $433.9 million in 2010, compared to operating income of $461.0 million in 2009. Operating income was favorably impacted in 2010 by $18.5 million due to the effect of foreign currency translation. Operating income was unfavorably impacted by $46.7 million associated with lower sales volumes, $22.1 million of increased retiree benefit expense, $9.0 million of warranty and performance penalties and $5.8 million of product expense, primarily made up of research & development costs. Partially offsetting these decreases in operating income were higher margins related to price realization and the mix of products sold, favorable material input costs, and the benefit of prior year cost reduction programs. Operating income in 2009 was reduced by $9.0 million for severance and related expenses not repeated in 2010. 30 Index Operating income for Surface Mining Equipment was $336.2 million in 2010, compared to operating income of $322.2 million in 2009. Operating income was favorably impacted in 2010 by $2.5 million due to the effect of foreign currency translation. Operating income was favorably impacted by higher sales volumes, favorable material input costs of $7.1 million, and the benefit of prior year cost reduction programs. These increases were partially offset by $11.4 million of increased retiree benefit expense. In addition, cancellation income of $8.5 million was recorded in 2009 and not repeated in 2010. Product Development, Selling and Administrative Expense Product development, selling and administrative expense was $480.6 million, or 14% of sales, in 2010, compared to $454.5 million, or 13% of sales, in 2009. These expenses were unfavorably impacted by $17.8 million due to the effect of the foreign currency translation. Product development, selling and administrative expense increased in 2010 due to $22.4 million of increased retiree benefit costs and $7.2 million of increased performance based compensation, partially offset by the benefit of cost saving initiatives implemented in 2009. Administrative expense also included increased severance and related expenses of $14.4 million in 2009 that was not repeated in 2010. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense was $16.8 million in 2010, compared to $24.7 million in 2009. Net interest expense decreased primarily due to interest earned on increased cash and cash equivalents. Provision for Income Taxes Income tax expense was $217.5 million in 2010, with an effective tax rate of 32.0%, compared to income tax expense of $228.0 million in 2009, with an effective tax rate of 33.4%. The main drivers of the variance in tax rates when compared to the statutory rate of 35.0% were the geographic mix of earnings and the utilization of tax credits and tax holidays offset by increased state income taxes and establishment of valuation reserves. A net discrete tax benefit of $3.4 million was recorded in 2010, compared to net discrete tax expense of $8.2 million in 2009. A review of uncertain income tax positions was performed throughout 2010 and 2009 and a net benefit of $4.4 million and $1.8 million, respectively, was recorded. Reorganization Items Reorganization items include income, expenses, and losses that were realized or incurred by the Predecessor Company as a result of its decision to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. We emerged from protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on July 12, 2001. Net reorganization items for 2011, 2010, and 2009 consisted of the following: In thousands 2011 2010 2009 Beloit U.K. receivership settlement $ $ $ 5,665 Professional fees directly related to the reorganization and other (35 ) (1,310 ) (605 ) Net reorganization (expense) income $ (35 ) $ (1,310 ) $ 5,060 31 Index Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to bad debts, excess inventory, warranty, intangible assets, income taxes, and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the accounting policies described below are the policies that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments, and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results of operations. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue on aftermarket products and services when the following criteria are satisfied: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, product delivery and title transfer has occurred or the services have been rendered, the price is fixed and determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue on long term contracts, such as for the manufacture of mining shovels, draglines, roof support systems and conveyor systems, using the percentage of completion method. When using the percentage of completion method, sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion. Sales and gross profit are adjusted prospectively for revisions in estimated total contract costs and contract values. Estimated losses are recognized in full when identified. Approximately 85% of our sales in 2011 were recorded at the time of shipment of the product or delivery of the service, with the remaining 15% of sales recorded using percentage of completion accounting. We have life cycle management contracts with customers to supply parts and service for terms of 1 to 17 years. These contracts are established based on the conditions the equipment will be operating in, the time horizon that the contracts will cover, and the expected operating cycle that will be required for the equipment. Based on this information, a model is created representing the projected costs and revenues of servicing the respective machines over the specified contract terms. Accounting for these contracts requires us to make various estimates, including estimates of the relevant machines long term maintenance requirements. Under these contracts, customers are generally billed monthly based on hours of operation or units of production achieved by the equipment, with the respective deferred revenues recorded when billed. Revenue is recognized in the period in which parts are supplied or services provided. These contracts are reviewed quarterly by comparison of actual results to original estimates or most recent analysis, with revenue recognition adjusted appropriately for future estimated costs. If a loss is expected at any time, the full amount of the loss is recognized immediately. We have certain customer agreements that are multiple element arrangements as defined by the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 605 25 Multiple Element Arrangements. The agreements are assessed for multiple elements based on the following criteria: the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis, there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item, and the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor. Revenue is then allocated to each identified unit of accounting based on our estimate of their relative fair values. Revenue recognition involves judgments, including assessments of expected returns, the likelihood of nonpayment, and estimates of expected costs and profits on long term contracts. We analyze various factors, including a review of specific transactions, historical experience, credit worthiness of customers, and current market and economic conditions, in determining when to recognize revenue. Changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized with a resulting impact on the timing and amount of associated income. 32 Index Inventories Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first in, first out method for all inventories. We evaluate the need to record valuation adjustments for inventory on a regular basis. Our policy is to evaluate all inventories including raw material, work in process, finished goods, and spare parts. Inventory in excess of our estimated usage requirements is written down to its estimated net realizable value. Inherent in the estimates of net realizable value are estimates related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, possible alternative uses, and ultimate realization of potentially excess inventory. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Intangible assets include drawings, patents, trademarks, technology, customer relationships and other specifically identifiable assets. Indefinite lived intangible assets are not being amortized. Indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes occur that suggest impairment in carrying value, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate. As part of the impairment analysis, we use the discounted cash flow model based on royalties estimated to be derived in the future use of the asset were we to license the use of the indefinite lived asset. No impairment was identified as part of our fourth quarter impairment testing of our indefinite lived intangible assets. Finite lived intangible assets are amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed, which is principally the straight line method. Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment if events or changes occur that suggest impairment in carrying value. No impairment was identified related to our finite lived intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is assigned to specific reporting units, which we have identified as our operating segments, and tested for impairment at least annually, during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that a reporting units carrying amount is greater than its fair value. Goodwill is tested for impairment using the two step approach, in accordance with ASC No. 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other. The fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the recorded book value, step one. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired and step two is not considered necessary. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the impairment test continues by comparing the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill to the implied fair value of goodwill. The implied fair value is computed by adjusting all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to current fair value with the offset adjustment to goodwill. The adjusted goodwill balance is the implied fair value of the goodwill. An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill. The discounted cash flow model involves many assumptions, including operating results forecasts and discount rates. Inherent in the operating results forecasts are certain assumptions regarding revenue growth rates, projected cost saving initiatives and projected long term growth rates in the determination of terminal values. We performed our goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2011 and no impairment was identified. A one percentage point increase in the discount rate used to determine the fair value of the reporting units would not cause the carrying value of the respective reporting unit to exceed its fair value. Accrued Warranties We record accruals for potential warranty claims based on prior claim experience. Warranty costs are accrued at the time revenue is recognized. These warranty costs are based upon managements assessment of past claims and current experience. However, actual claims could be higher or lower than amounts estimated, as the amount and value of warranty claims are subject to variation as a result of many factors that cannot be predicted with certainty. 33 Index Pension and Postretirement Benefits and Costs Pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. The primary assumptions include factors such as discount rates, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates and rate of compensation increases, discussed below: Discount rates: We generally estimate the discount rate for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations using a process based on a hypothetical investment in a portfolio of high quality bonds that approximate the estimated cash flows of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. We believe this approach permits a matching of future cash outflows related to benefit payments with future cash inflows associated with bond coupons and maturities. Expected return on plan assets: Our expected return on plan assets is derived from reviews of asset allocation strategies and anticipated future long term performance of individual asset classes weighted by the allocation of our plan assets. Our analysis gives appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns; however, the assumptions are primarily based on long term, prospective rates of return. Mortality rates: Mortality rates are based on the RP 2000 mortality table. Rate of compensation increase: The rate of compensation increase reflects our long term actual experience and its outlook, including consideration of expected rates of inflation. Actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods, and therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement plan obligations and future expense. Future changes affecting the above assumptions will change the related pension benefit or expense. As such, a 0.25% change in the discount rate and rate of return on net assets would have the following effects on projected benefit obligation and pension expense, respectively, as of and for the fiscal year ended October 28, 2011: 0.25% Increase 0.25% Decrease Discount Expected long term Discount Expected long term In thousands rate rate of return rate rate of return U.S. Pension Plans: Net pension expense $ (2,548 ) $ (1,875 ) $ 2,552 $ 1,875 Projected benefit obligation (31,490 ) 32,411 Non U.S. Pension Plans: Net pension expense (1,581 ) (1,172 ) 1,471 1,172 Projected benefit obligation (18,898 ) 19,545 Other Postretirement Benefit Plans: Net pension expense (26 ) (10 ) 28 10 Projected benefit obligation (540 ) 550 Income Taxes Deferred taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current statutory tax rates. Deferred income tax provisions are based on changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities from period to period. Additionally, we analyze our ability to recognize the net deferred tax assets created in each jurisdiction in which we operate to determine if valuation allowances are necessary based on the more likely than not criteria. 34 Index As required under the application of fresh start accounting, the release of pre emergence tax valuation reserves was not recorded in the income statement but instead was treated first as a reduction of excess reorganization value until exhausted, then intangibles until exhausted, and thereafter reported as additional paid in capital. Consequently, a net tax charge will be incurred in future years when these tax assets are utilized. We will continue to monitor the appropriateness of the existing valuation allowances and determine annually the amount of valuation allowances that are required to be maintained. As of October 28, 2011, there were $68.8 million of valuation allowances against pre emergence net operating loss carryforwards. All future reversals of pre emergence valuation allowances will be recorded to additional paid in capital. We estimate the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full year on an interim basis. The estimated effective tax rate contemplates the expected jurisdiction where income is earned (e.g., United States compared to non United States) as well as tax planning strategies. If the actual results are different from these estimates, adjustments to the effective tax rate may be required in the period such determination is made. Additionally, discrete items are treated separately from the effective rate analysis and are recorded separately as an income tax provision or benefit at the time they are recognized. To the extent recognized, these items will impact the effective tax rate in aggregate but will not adjust the amount used for future periods within the same year. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes the major elements of our working capital as of: In millions October 28, 2011 October 29, 2010 Accounts receivable $ 884,696 $ 674,135 Inventories 1,334,134 764,945 Accounts payable (452,519 ) (291,742 ) Advance payments (771,841 ) (376,300 ) Trade Working Capital $ 994,470 $ 771,038 Other current assets 190,568 107,266 Short term notes payable (35,895 ) (1,550 ) Employee compensation and benefits (147,664 ) (128,132 ) Accrued warranties (82,737 ) (62,351 ) Other current liabilities (206,588 ) (163,249 ) Working Capital Excluding Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 712,154 $ 523,022 Cash and Cash Equivalents 288,321 815,581 Working Capital $ 1,000,475 $ 1,338,603 The mining equipment business of LeTourneau added $165.4 million to trade working capital at October 28, 2011. We currently use trade working capital and cash flow from operations as two financial measurements to evaluate the performance of our operations and our ability to meet our financial obligations. We require trade working capital investment because our service model requires us to maintain certain inventory levels in order to maximize our customers machine reliability. This information also provides management with a focus on our receivable terms and collectability efforts and our ability to obtain advance payments on original equipment orders. As part of our continuous improvement of purchasing and manufacturing processes, we continue to strive for alignment of inventory levels with customer demand and current production schedules. Cash provided by continuing operations for 2011 was $499.7 million as compared to $583.5 million provided by operations for 2010. Cash provided by continuing operations was unfavorably impacted by increasing inventory levels to support our rising backlog, increases in retiree benefit plan payments over prior year, and increases in accounts receivables primarily due to improved sales in all regions in fiscal year 2011. Cash provided by continuing operations was favorably impacted by advance payments due to bookings in excess of shipments and increases in accounts payable. 35 Index Cash used by investing activities was $2.0 billion in 2011 compared to $74.9 million for 2010. The increase in cash used by investing activities for 2011 was driven by the $1.1 billion acquisition of LeTourneau, cash deposits of $866.0 million into an escrow account in anticipation of completing the IMM SPA and tender offer and $376.7 million of IMM share purchases. This was partially offset by the $375.0 million sale of the drilling products business of LeTourneau. Cash provided by financing activities for 2011 was $976.7 million compared to cash used by financing activities of $185.1 million for 2010. The change to cash being provided by financing activities for 2011 was driven by the entrance into a new $500.0 million term loan for the acquisition of LeTourneau and the issuance of $500.0 million of senior notes in anticipation of completing the IMM acquisition. We expect 2012 capital spending to be approximately $200.0 million. Capital projects will be focused on expanding service center capabilities globally and the increase of our manufacturing capabilities in the emerging markets. During each quarter of fiscal 2011 we declared a cash dividend of $0.175 per outstanding share of common stock and in fiscal 2011 we paid $73.3 million in dividends. For fiscal year 2012 we expect to contribute $180.0 million to $190.0 million to our employee pension plans. As of October 28, 2011 we have a net unfunded pension and other post retirement liability of $362.2 million. To fund our acquisition of IMM, we have $866.0 million of restricted cash in escrow, of which $375.0 million was provided by the sale of the drilling products business of LeTourneau and $491.0 million was provided by the net proceeds of the October 2011 issuance of our $500.0 million 5.125% Senior Notes due October 15, 2021 (the 2021 Notes). We also have a $250.0 million term loan commitment that we entered into on October 31, 2011 and we have a remaining commitment of $234.0 million that we may draw under the Bridge Loan Agreement dated July 11, 2011. However, if we do not receive approval from MOFCOM, the $866.0 million held in escrow will become unrestricted cash, the 2021 Notes may be redeemed, in whole, but not in part, and we would not draw upon the commitments under the October 31, 2011 term loan or the July 11, 2011 Bridge Loan Agreement. We believe our liquidity and capital resources are adequate to meet our projected needs. We have $288.3 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at October 28, 2011, of which $173.2 million is held outside of the United States, and $866.0 million of restricted cash in escrow. Requirements for working capital, dividends, pension contributions, capital spending, acquisitions and principal and interest payments on our term loan and senior notes will be adequately funded by cash on hand, continuing operations and supplemented by short and long term borrowings, as required. Credit Facilities and Senior Notes On June 21, 2011, we exercised our option under the $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility dated as of October 27, 2010 (the Credit Agreement) to increase the aggregate revolving commitment available by an additional $200.0 million. As increased, the $700.0 million Credit Agreement is set to expire November 3, 2014. In fiscal 2010 we took a pre tax charge of $0.3 million related to deferred financing costs associated with the termination of the previous $400.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that was to have expired on November 10, 2011. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement we pay a commitment fee ranging from 0.25% to 0.5% on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility based on our credit rating. Outstanding borrowings bear interest equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) (defined as applicable LIBOR rate for the equivalent interest period plus 1.75% to 2.75% depending upon our credit rating) or the Base Rate (defined as the highest of the Prime Rate, Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5%, or Eurodollar Rate plus 1.0%) at our option. The Credit Agreement requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants including leverage and interest coverage ratios. The Credit Agreement also restricts payment of dividends or other return of capital when the consolidated leverage ratio exceeds a stated amount. At October 28, 2011, we were in compliance with all financial covenants of the Credit Agreement and had no restrictions on the payment of dividends or return of capital. 36 Index At October 28, 2011, there were no direct borrowings under the Credit Agreement. Outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement, which count toward the $700.0 million credit limit, totaled $265.9 million. At October 28, 2011, there was $434.1 million available for borrowings under the Credit Agreement. In November 2006, we issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.0% Senior Notes due 2016 and $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.625% Senior Notes due 2036 (Notes) with interest on the Notes being paid semi annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, starting on May 15, 2007. The Notes are guaranteed by each of our current and future material domestic subsidiaries. The Notes were issued in a private placement under an exemption from registration provided by the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), as amended. In the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the Notes were exchanged for substantially identical notes that are registered under the Securities Act. At our option, we may redeem some or all of the Notes at a redemption price of the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the principal amounts and the remaining scheduled interest payments using a discount rate equal to the sum of a treasury rate of a comparable treasury issue plus 0.3% for the 2016 Notes and 0.375% for the 2036 Notes. The acquisition of LeTourneau was funded in part by utilizing in full a new $500.0 million term loan commitment (Term Loan) dated June 16, 2011. The Term Loan requires quarterly principal payments beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 and matures June 16, 2016. The Term Loan contains terms and conditions that are substantially similar to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement. Outstanding borrowings bear interest equal to LIBOR (defined as applicable LIBOR rate for the equivalent interest period plus 1.25% to 2.125% depending upon our credit rating) or the Base Rate (defined as the highest of the Prime Rate, Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5%, or Eurodollar Rate plus 1.0%) at our option. The Term Loan is guaranteed by each of our current and future material domestic subsidiaries and requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants, including leverage and interest coverage ratios. At October 28, 2011, we were in compliance with all financial covenants of the Term Loan. On July 11, 2011 we entered into a SPA to acquire approximately 41.1% of the outstanding common stock of IMM, a Hong Kong Stock Exchange listed designer and manufacturer of underground and coal mining equipment located in China. Pursuant to Rule 26.1 of the Hong Kong Takeovers Code, upon receipt of regulatory approval and closing of the purchase under the SPA, we will be required to make an offer for the remaining IMM shares and outstanding options to purchase IMM shares. In conjunction with the SPA, we entered into a $1.5 billion senior unsecured bridge term loan facility on July 11, 2011 (the Bridge Loan Agreement) that has subsequently been reduced under terms of the Bridge Loan Agreement by the value of open market purchases of IMM shares, cash deposits into escrow from the new 5.125% senior notes due 2021, proceeds from the closing of the sale of LeTourneaus drilling products business, and voluntary reductions. Under the original terms of the Bridge Loan Agreement, we had the ability to draw up to a maximum of $650.0 million on the closing date of the SPA and subsequently in multiple draws of no less than $10.0 million at any time during the period beginning on the commencement of the mandatory tender offer and ending on the date on which all amounts payable with respect to the tender offer have been paid. As a result of the commitment reductions outlined above, the Bridge Loan Agreement provides the ability to draw a total of $234.0 million. Under the terms of the Bridge Loan Agreement, proceeds of any advances under the commitment are to be deposited to the escrow account associated with the IMM offer. Any unused commitments of the Bridge Loan Agreement shall expire on the earlier of (i) the date on which the SPA is terminated without the purchase having been consummated, (ii) March 11, 2012, unless the purchase is consummated on or prior to such date, (iii) the date that is 90 days following the 41.1% purchase date, as defined in the Bridge Loan Agreement, (iv) the date on which all amounts payable pursuant to the tender offer have been paid, (v) the date on which the commitments are terminated, reduced or prepaid, or (vi) May 11, 2012. Outstanding borrowings bear interest equal to Eurodollar rate plus a margin that varies with our credit rating and base rate loans (defined as the higher of the prime rate, Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5% or one month Eurodollar Rate plus 1.0%) plus a margin that varies with our credit rating. We also pay a commitment fee ranging from 0.25% to 0.375% on the undrawn portion of the credit facility based on our credit rating. The Bridge Loan Agreement requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants, including leverage and interest coverage ratios that are substantially similar to those in the Credit Agreement. At October 28, 2011, no amounts were outstanding under the Bridge Loan Agreement and we were in compliance with all financial covenants of the Bridge Loan Agreement. On October 12, 2011, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% Senior Notes due October 15, 2021 (the 2021 Notes). Interest on the 2021 Notes will be paid semi annually in arrears on October 15 and April 15 of each year, starting on April 15, 2012 and the 2021 Notes are guaranteed by each of our current and future material domestic subsidiaries. At our option, we may redeem some or all of the 2021 Notes at a redemption price of the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the principal amounts and the remaining scheduled interest payments using a discount rate equal to the sum of a treasury rate of a comparable treasury issue plus 0.5%. We may redeem the 2021 Notes, in whole but not in part, in the event that (i) we do not consummate the purchase of IMM shares under the SPA by July 1, 2012, if we receive MOFCOM approval prior to such date, or by October 1, 2012, if we do not receive MOFCOM approval prior to July 1, 2012 or (ii) the IMM Purchase Agreement is terminated prior to either such date, at a redemption price equal to 101.0% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the special acquisition redemption date. 37 Index On October 31, 2011 we entered into a credit agreement that provides for a further term loan commitment (Commitment) of $250.0 million that may be drawn in a single advance up to March 1, 2012. If drawn upon the Commitment requires quarterly principal payments beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 and matures June 16, 2016. The Commitment contains terms and conditions that are substantially similar to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement and the Term Loan. Outstanding borrowings bear interest equal to the LIBOR (defined as applicable LIBOR rate for the equivalent interest period plus 1.50% to 2.50% depending on our credit rating) or the Base Rate (defined as the highest of the Prime Rate, Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5%, or Eurodollar Rate plus 1.0%) at our option. The Commitment is guaranteed by each of our current and future material domestic subsidiaries and requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants, including leverage and interest coverage ratios. Upon approval from MOFCOM and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, we intend to use the net proceeds to fund in part the acquisition of shares under the SPA and related tender offer of IMM. Any remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. Advance Payments and Progress Billings As part of the negotiation process associated with original equipment orders, we generally require advance payments and contracts generally require progress payments from our customers to support the procurement of inventory and other resources. As of October 28, 2011, advance payments and progress billings were $771.8 million. As orders are shipped or costs incurred, the advanced payments and progress billings are recognized as revenue in the consolidated income statement. Retiree Benefits We sponsor pension plans in both the U.S. and other countries. The significance of the funding requirements of these plans are largely dependent on the actual value of the plan assets, the investment returns on the plan assets, actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, and the impact of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. During 2011, we contributed $184.3 million to our worldwide retiree benefit plans compared to $117.4 million during 2010. We expect to make contributions of between $180.0 million to $190.0 million to our U.S. plans and non U.S. plans in 2012. Stock Repurchase Program Under our share repurchase program, management is authorized to repurchase up to $2.0 billion in shares of common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions until December 31, 2011. During 2011 and 2010 we did not repurchase any shares, but in 2009, we repurchased 608,720 shares of common stock for approximately $13.7 million. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We lease various assets under operating leases. The aggregate payments under operating leases as of October 28, 2011 are disclosed in the table of Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments below. No significant changes to lease commitments have occurred during 2011. We have no other off balance sheet arrangements. 38 Index Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of October 28, 2011: Less Than 1 3 3 5 More than In thousands Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Long Term Debt* $ 1,985,906 $ 81,813 $ 201,125 $ 463,625 $ 1,239,343 Capital Lease Obligations 198 150 48 Purchase Obligations 36,446 29,506 4,807 2,133 Operating Leases 99,944 29,227 40,588 15,417 14,712 Other Long Term Obligations** 106,062 78,607 6,949 6,607 13,899 $ 2,228,556 $ 219,303 $ 253,517 $ 487,782 $ 1,267,954 * Includes interest ** Includes minimum required contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans for 2011 and required contributions for our unfunded other postretirement benefit plans for 2012 and beyond. New Accounting Pronouncements Our new accounting pronouncements are set forth under Item 15 Exhibits and Financial Statements Schedules of this annual report and are incorporated herein by reference. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to fluctuations in earnings and cash flows due to volatility in interest rates, commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. We monitor our risks on a continuous basis and generally enter into derivative instruments to minimize our foreign currency exposures. We do not engage in speculation in our derivative strategy. We assess effectiveness of our hedging relationships on an ongoing basis to ensure the transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of the hedged item. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long term debt obligations. We have a combination of fixed and variable rate debt (See Note 11 Borrowings and Credit Facilities) and interest rate movements impact the value of fixed rate debt and cash flows on variable rate debt. At October 28, 2011, we were not party to any interest rate derivative contracts. Commodity Price Risk We purchase certain raw materials, including steel and copper, that are subject to price volatility caused by systematic risks. Although future movements in raw material prices are unpredictable, we manage this risk through periodic purchases of raw materials and passing some or all price increases to our customers. At October 28, 2011, we were not a party to any commodity forward contracts. 39 Index Foreign Currency Risk We have a risk averse Foreign Exchange Risk Management Policy under which significant exposures that impact earnings and cash flows are hedged. Exposures that impact only equity or do not have a cash flow impact are generally not hedged with derivatives. We hedge two categories of foreign exchange exposures: assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency, which include future committed receipts or payments denominated in a foreign currency and certain U.S. functional currency entity balance sheet accounts denominated in local currencies. These exposures normally arise from the import and export of goods and from intercompany trade and lending activity. Our significant foreign subsidiaries use local currencies as their functional currency. For consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities are translated at month end exchange rates and income and expense are translated at average exchange rates. Translation gains and losses on asset and liabilities are not included in determining net income (loss) but are accumulated as a separate component of shareholders equity. Exchange gains or losses incurred on transactions conducted by one of our operations in a currency other than the operations functional currency are included in determining net income (loss). During 2011, we realized a gain of $1.2 million arising from foreign currency transactions. Foreign exchange derivatives at October 28, 2011 were in the form of forward exchange contracts executed over the counter. There is a concentration of these contracts held with Bank of America, N.A. The fair value of our forward exchange contracts at October 28, 2011 is analyzed in the following table of dollar equivalent terms: Fair Value In thousands Buy Sell Australian Dollar $ 719 $ (5 ) Brazilian Real 401 British Pound Sterling 499 166 Chilean Peso (229 ) 658 Euro 470 (169 ) Poland Zloty 1,123 South African Rand (1,128 ) (53 ) U.S. Dollar 4 2,444 Total $ 1,859 $ 3,041 40 Index The following tables present our forward exchange contract balances with an aggregate notional amount greater than $6.0 million.
