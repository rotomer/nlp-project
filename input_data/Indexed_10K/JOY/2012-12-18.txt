Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes. References made to years are for fiscal year periods. Dollar amounts are in thousands, except share and per share data and as indicated. The purpose of this discussion and analysis is to enhance the understanding and evaluation of the results of operations, financial position, cash flows, indebtedness, and other key financial information of Joy Global Inc. and its subsidiaries for 2012, 2011, and 2010. For a more complete understanding of this discussion, please read the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. Overview We have been manufacturing mining equipment for over 125 years. We operate in two business segments: Underground Mining Machinery and Surface Mining Equipment. We are a leading manufacturer and servicer of high productivity mining equipment for the extraction of coal and other minerals and ores. Our Underground Mining Machinery segment is a major manufacturer of underground mining equipment for the extraction of coal and other bedded minerals. Our Surface Mining Equipment segment is a major producer of surface mining equipment for the extraction of ores and minerals and provides extensive operational support for many types of equipment used in surface mining. Both segments offer comprehensive service locations near major mining regions worldwide. In addition to selling original equipment, we provide parts, components, repairs, rebuilds, diagnostic analysis, training, and other aftermarket services for our installed base of machines. We also provide aftermarket services for equipment manufactured by other companies, including manufacturers with which we have ongoing relationships and which we refer to as Alliance Partners. We emphasize our aftermarket products and services as an integral part of lowering our customers cost per unit of production and are focused on continuing to grow this part of our business. LeTourneau Technologies, Inc. On June 22, 2011 we purchased LeTourneau Technologies, Inc. for approximately $1.1 billion. We purchased all of the outstanding capital stock. LeTourneau designs, builds and supports equipment for the mining industry and has been a leader in the earthmoving equipment industry since the 1920s. LeTourneau operated in three business segments, mining, steel products and drilling products. The mining products business is the worlds leading manufacturer of large wheel loaders for surface mining, providing the industrys largest model sizes and payload capacities. On October 24, 2011 we completed the sale of LeTourneau Technologies Drilling Systems, Inc. to Cameron International Corporation for $375.0 million in cash, subject to a post closing working capital adjustment of which $56.3 million was paid in 2012. The LeTourneau facilities in Houston, Texas and Vicksburg, Mississippi were sold to Cameron International Corporation in conjunction with this transaction. We entered into a Transition Manufacturing and Supply Agreement to allow for the orderly transfer of drilling products production from Longview and a Steel Supply Agreement to allow the buyer time to develop other sources. In conjunction with our entrance into the Transition Manufacturing and Supply Agreement, we recognized an upfront loss and related liability of $23.3 million in our 2011 fiscal year for unreimbursable manufacturing costs. The results of the drilling products business are included in discontinued operations on the accompanying consolidated statement of income and the assets and liabilities of the drilling products business are reflected as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The results of the mining and steel businesses (collectively the mining equipment business) are included in our Surface Mining Equipment segment. From the date of acquisition until our 2011 fiscal year end, the mining equipment business of LeTourneau had net sales of $144.9 million and operating income of $23.2 million. 2011 operating income was reduced by $8.8 million for non recurring purchase accounting charges, of which $7.7 million was attributable to acquired inventory. In fiscal year 2012, the mining equipment business of LeTourneau had net sales of $451.4 million and operating income of $73.8 million. 2012 operating income was reduced by $13.7 million for non recurring purchase accounting charges, of which $11.5 million was attributable to acquired inventory. 27 Table of Contents International Mining Machinery On July 11, 2011, we entered into an SPA with TJCC Holdings Limited, a corporation controlled by The Jordan Company, L.P., to acquire approximately 41.1%, of IMM. IMM is a leading designer and manufacturer of underground coal mining equipment in China. On July 28, 2011, August 16, 2011 and September 2, 2011 we purchased shares on the open market representing an aggregate of 28.1% of the total outstanding shares of IMM. On December 20, 2011, the Anti monopoly Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce of the Peoples Republic of China approved the purchase of IMM shares covered by the SPA and the acquisition closed on December 29, 2011. At such time, we acquired a controlling interest in IMM which, when aggregated with earlier open market purchases, was 69.2% of IMMs outstanding common stock. Upon closing, we recognized a $19.4 million gain on the re measurement of our pre existing equity interest in IMM. On January 6, 2012, in accordance with Rule 26.1 of the Hong Kong Takeovers Code, we commenced an unconditional cash tender offer to purchase the remaining outstanding IMM shares and options to purchase IMM shares that we did not own. On February 10, 2012, we completed the tender offer. As a result of the tender offer, our beneficial ownership of IMM common stock increased to 98.9%, for which we had paid aggregate consideration of approximately $1.4 billion. On July 25, 2012, we effected the compulsory acquisition of the remaining shares under applicable provisions of the Cayman Island Companies Law, under which IMM is incorporated. We paid consideration of approximately $16.2 million to complete the compulsory acquisition, using the remaining cash which had been placed in escrow to purchase IMM shares. The combined effect of these transactions resulted in our beneficial ownership of 100% of the common stock of IMM. From December 29, 2011, the date we acquired control of IMM, until our fiscal year end, IMM had net sales of $219.0 million and operating income of $9.4 million. Operating income was reduced by $27.4 million for non recurring purchase accounting charges, of which $20.9 million was attributable to acquired inventory. Operating Results Bookings for 2012 were approximately $5.1 billion, a decrease of 9.3% from the prior year. Underground original equipment bookings, which included $217.6 million from IMM, were down $316.6 million, or 20.6%, when compared to the prior year. When excluding the impact of the IMM acquisition, these bookings decreased in all regions except for Africa due to the weakening coal market in the U.S. and China, as well as significant orders from customers in Australia and Russia in the prior year that did not repeat in 2012. Underground Mining Machinery aftermarket bookings were substantially flat compared to the prior year. Increases in aftermarket bookings in China, Africa, and Australia were partially offset by declining orders in the U.S. and Eurasia. Surface Mining Equipment original equipment orders, which included an incremental $236.3 million increase from the acquisition of LeTourneau, were down $221.5 million, or 16.7%, when compared to the prior year. These bookings were down in all regions except Africa and Australia due to weaker markets and the record bookings in the prior year. Surface Mining Equipment aftermarket bookings increased $186.6 million, or 14.0%. These bookings increased in South America, Australia, and Eurasia due to increased demand for parts and services. All other regions experienced declining aftermarket orders. Compared to last year, fiscal year 2012 bookings included a $97.1 million unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation. Net sales for 2012 totaled approximately $5.7 billion compared to $4.4 billion in 2011, an increase of 28.5%. In 2012, IMM had sales of $219.0 million and LeTourneaus sales increased by $306.5 million. Aftermarket sales increased $332.4 million, or 12.7%, when compared to the prior year due to increased parts sales and machine assemblies for both the Underground Mining Machinery and Surface Mining Equipment segments. Original equipment sales increased $924.6 million, or 51.8%, when compared to the prior year due to last years strong order rate flowing to this years sales. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted sales by $51.4 million. Operating income in 2012 was $1.2 billion compared to prior year operating income of $920.2 million, an increase of 27.4%. Operating income in 2012 and 2011 was reduced by $41.1 million and $8.8 million in non recurring purchase accounting charges, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily the result of increased sales volume, offset by pension curtailment charges, restructuring costs and an increase in unfavorable manufacturing variances. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted operating income by $11.6 million. 28 Table of Contents The results of LeTourneaus mining equipment business are included in our Surface Mining Equipment segment. In fiscal year 2012, LeTourneaus mining equipment business had bookings of $495.1 million, net sales of $451.4 million and operating income of $73.8 million. Operating income was reduced by $26.1 million for purchase accounting charges. Non recurring purchase accounting charges amounted to $13.7 million, of which $11.5 million was attributable to acquired inventory. The results of IMM are included in our Underground Mining Machinery segment. From December 29, 2011 through the end of our fiscal year, IMM had bookings of $217.6 million, net sales of $219.0 million and operating income of $9.4 million, Operating income was reduced by $40.1 million for purchase accounting charges. Non recurring purchase accounting charges amounted to $27.4 million, of which $20.9 million was attributable to acquired inventories for which amortization ended in 2012. Income from continuing operations attributable to Joy Global Inc. was approximately $767.1 million, or $7.18 per diluted share, in 2012 compared to $631.0 million, or $5.92 per diluted share, in 2011. Results of Operations 2012 Compared with 2011 Sales The following table sets forth 2012 and 2011 net sales as derived from our Consolidated Statement of Income: $ % In thousands 2012 2011 Change Change Net Sales Underground Mining Machinery $ 3,107,488 $ 2,576,625 $ 530,863 20.6 % Surface Mining Equipment 2,737,488 1,959,353 778,135 39.7 % Eliminations (184,087 ) (132,072 ) (52,015 ) Total $ 5,660,889 $ 4,403,906 $ 1,256,983 28.5 % Underground Mining Machinery net sales for 2012 were $3.1 billion compared to $2.6 billion for 2011, and included a $136.2 million increase in aftermarket sales, a $175.7 million increase in original equipment sales and $219.0 million in sales from the acquisition of IMM. Aftermarket sales increased in China and Australia by $111.5 million and $46.6 million, respectively, primarily due to increased demand for parts. Original equipment sales increased in Australia and Eurasia by $214.8 million and $36.0 million, respectively, primarily due to increased roof support sales in both regions and increased bolter miner and conveyor system sales in Australia. The increase in original equipment sales from Australia and Eurasia was partially offset by decreases in sales from China and North America. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted sales by $39.7 million. Surface Mining Equipment net sales for 2012 were $2.7 billion compared to $2.0 billion for 2011, which included a $93.8 million increase in aftermarket sales, a $377.9 million increase in original equipment sales and a $306.4 million increase in sales from the acquisition of LeTourneau. Aftermarket sales increased in all regions except China primarily due to increased demand for parts. Original equipment sales increased in all regions except Africa, primarily due to last years strong order rate flowing to this years sales. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted sales by $11.7 million. 29 Table of Contents Operating Income The following table sets forth 2012 and 2011 operating income as derived from our Consolidated Statement of Income: 2012 2011 Operating % Operating % In thousands Income (loss) of Net Sales Income (loss) of Net Sales Operating income (loss): Underground Mining Machinery $ 671,797 21.6 % $ 595,262 23.1 % Surface Mining Equipment 592,687 21.7 % 422,472 21.6 % Corporate Expenses (51,079 ) (65,693 ) Eliminations (40,846 ) (31,862 ) Total $ 1,172,559 20.7 % $ 920,179 20.9 % Operating income for the Underground Mining Machinery segment was $671.8 million in fiscal 2012, compared to operating income of $595.3 million in fiscal 2011. The Underground Mining Machinery segment return on sales was reduced by 1.3 points from a year ago due to IMM, including the non recurring purchase accounting charges of $27.4 million from the acquisition. In addition to the $9.4 million attributable to IMM, operating income was favorably impacted by $127.1 million due to higher sales volumes, which was partially offset by $23.2 million of increased period costs, $6.5 million of restructuring costs, and $2.1 million due to pension curtailment and special termination benefit charges. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted operating income by $11.5 million. Operating income for the Surface Mining Equipment segment was $592.7 million in fiscal 2012, compared to operating income of $422.5 million in fiscal 2011. Operating income in 2012 increased $50.6 million from the acquisition of LeTourneau. LeTourneaus 2012 and 2011 operating income was reduced by $13.7 million and $8.8 million, respectively, for non recurring purchase accounting charges. In addition to the $50.6 million increase from LeTourneau, operating income was favorably impacted by $148.3 million due to higher sales volumes, which was partially offset by $37.2 million of increased period costs, $10.3 million due to pension curtailment and special termination benefit charges, and $2.4 million of restructuring charges. Corporate expense decreased by $14.6 million primarily due to the IMM remeasurement gain of $19.4 million upon obtaining a controlling interest in IMM in December 2011. Product Development, Selling and Administrative Expense Product development, selling and administrative expense was $736.8 million, or 13.0% of sales, in 2012, compared to $602.0 million, or 13.7% of sales, in 2011. The inclusion of LeTourneau and IMM increased product development, selling and administrative expenses by $74.6 million. In addition to the $74.6 million attributable to the acquisitions operations, product development costs increased by an additional $9.6 million driven by research and development activities on new or existing products and increased personnel for smart services activities. Selling costs increased by $13.3 million to support increased sales volumes and aftermarket infrastructure. The increase in administrative expenses of $37.1 million relates to restructuring charges of $9.9 million and increased performance based compensation of $8.0 million. 30 Table of Contents Net Interest Expense Net interest expense was $67.4 million in 2012, compared to $24.3 million in 2011. Net interest expense increased as a result of borrowings used to fund the acquisitions. We entered into a $500.0 million term loan dated June 16, 2011 for the acquisition of LeTourneau, issued $500.0 million of Senior Notes on October 12, 2011 in anticipation of completing the IMM transaction, and on February 10, 2012 we drew on an additional term loan of $250.0 million for the acquisition of IMM. Provision for Income Taxes Income tax expense for 2012 was $337.9 million as compared to $264.8 million in 2011. The effective income tax rates from continuing operations were 30.6% and 29.6% for 2012 and 2011, respectively. The main drivers of the variance in tax rates when compared to the statutory rate of 35% were the geographic mix of earnings with the corresponding net favorable differences in foreign statutory tax rates. Net discrete tax benefits of $7.6 million were recorded in 2012 as compared to net discrete tax benefits of $5.4 million in 2011. 2011 Compared with 2010 Sales The following table sets forth 2011 and 2010 net sales as derived from our Consolidated Statement of Income: $ % In thousands 2011 2010 Change Change Net Sales Underground Mining Machine $ 2,576,625 $ 2,126,788 $ 449,837 21.2 % Surface Mining Equipment 1,959,353 1,518,605 440,748 29.0 % Eliminations (132,072 ) (121,059 ) (11,013 ) Total $ 4,403,906 $ 3,524,334 $ 879,572 25.0 % Underground Mining Machinery net sales for 2011 were $2.6 billion compared to $2.1 billion for 2010, and included a $287.7 million increase in aftermarket sales and a $162.1 million increase in original equipment sales. Aftermarket sales increased across all regions. Specifically, aftermarket sales increased in the U.S. and Australasia by $113.5 million and $55.6 million, respectively, primarily due to the strengthening of the parts and rebuild markets in these regions. Additionally, strong parts demand in China caused aftermarket sales to increase by 56.8%, or $52.1 million. The increase in original equipment sales was led primarily by increased room and pillar sales in both the U.S. and South Africa and by roof support sales for longwall application equipment orders in Australasia. These increases were partially offset by decreased longwall equipment volumes in Eurasia and China. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted sales by $77.4 million. Surface Mining Equipment net sales for 2011 were $2.0 billion compared to $1.5 billion for 2010, which included a $189.2 million increase in aftermarket sales, a $106.6 million increase in original equipment sales and $144.9 million in sales from the mining equipment business of LeTourneau. Aftermarket sales increased across all regions and were led by increased sales in North and South America of $64.5 million and $91.6 million, respectively. Original equipment sales of electric mining shovels and drills increased across all regions, with the exception of North America. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted sales by $31.9 million. 31 Table of Contents Operating Income The following table sets forth 2011 and 2010 operating income as derived from our Consolidated Statement of Income: 2011 2010 Operating % Operating % In thousands Income (loss) of Net Sales Income (loss) of Net Sales Operating income (loss): Underground Mining Machinery $ 595,262 23.1 % $ 433,902 20.4 % Surface Mining Equipment 422,472 21.6 % 336,236 22.1 % Corporate Expense (65,693 ) (43,126 ) Eliminations (31,862 ) (29,909 ) Total $ 920,179 20.9 % $ 697,103 19.8 % Operating income for the Underground Mining Machinery segment was $595.3 million in fiscal 2011, compared to operating income of $433.9 million in fiscal 2010. Operating income was favorably impacted by $175.1 million due to higher sales volumes, $52.2 million due to favorable manufacturing overhead absorption and $45.4 million in favorable overall price realization. These increases were partially offset by $67.9 million of unfavorable changes in material price variances due to rising steel costs and other surcharges, $49.4 million of increased product development, selling and administrative expenses and $6.6 million from a prior year foreign currency gain that was not repeated in the current year. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted operating income by $17.9 million. Operating income for the Surface Mining Equipment segment was $422.5 million in fiscal 2011, compared to operating income of $336.2 million in fiscal 2010. Operating income was favorably impacted by $172.4 million due to higher sales volumes, $17.7 million due to favorable manufacturing overhead absorption and $11.3 million of cancellation charges. Operating income in 2011 includes $23.2 million from LeTourneaus mining equipment business which includes purchase accounting charges of $12.2 million. Partially offsetting these increases were $41.1 million of unfavorable changes in material price variances due to rising material costs and surcharges and $48.0 million of increased product development, selling and administrative expense. Corporate expense increased due to acquisition transaction costs of $19.7 million. Product Development, Selling and Administrative Expense Product development, selling and administrative expense was $602.0 million, or 13.7% of sales, in 2011, compared to $480.6 million, or 13.6% of sales, in 2010. Before acquisition transaction costs of $19.7 million in 2011, product development, selling and administrative expenses totaled $582.3 million, or 13.2% of sales. Product development costs increased by $20.8 million, which is attributable to research and development activities on new or existing products and increased personnel for smart services activities. Selling costs increased by $34.0 million due to travel, warehouse costs to support increased parts volumes and the inclusion of $5.6 million from LeTourneaus mining equipment business. Administrative expenses increased primarily due to acquisition transaction costs. 32 Table of Contents Net Interest Expense Net interest expense was $24.3 million in 2011, compared to $16.8 million in 2010. Net interest expense increased as a result of additional borrowings. We entered into a $500.0 million term loan dated June 16, 2011 for the acquisition of LeTourneau and issued $500.0 million of Senior Notes on October 12, 2011 in anticipation of completing the IMM transaction. Provision for Income Taxes Income tax expense for 2011 was $264.8 million, as compared to $217.5 million in 2010. The effective income tax rates from continuing operations were 29.6% and 32.0%, for 2011 and 2010, respectively. The main drivers of the variance in tax rates when compared to the statutory rate of 35% were the geographic mix of earnings with the corresponding net favorable differences in foreign statutory tax rates and the utilization of tax credits and tax holidays, offset by increased state income taxes and the establishment of valuation reserves. A net discrete tax benefit of $5.4 million was recorded in 2011 as compared to a net discrete tax benefit of $3.4 million in 2010. A review of uncertain income tax positions was performed throughout 2011 and 2010 as part of the overall income tax provision and a net benefit of $2.9 million and $4.4 million, respectively, was recorded on a global basis. Reorganization Items Reorganization items include income, expenses, and losses that were realized or incurred by our predecessor as a result of its decision to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. We emerged from protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on July 12, 2001. Net reorganization items for 2012, 2011, and 2010 consisted of the following: In thousands 2012 2011 2010 Professional fees directly related to the reorganization (35 ) (1,310 ) Net reorganization expense $ $ (35 ) $ (1,310 ) Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to bad debts, excess inventory, warranty, intangible assets, income taxes, and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the accounting policies described below are the policies that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments, and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results of operations. 33 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue on aftermarket products and services when the following criteria are satisfied: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, product delivery and title transfer has occurred or the services have been rendered, the price is fixed and determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue on long term contracts, such as for the manufacture of mining shovels, draglines, roof support systems and conveyor systems, using the percentage of completion method. When using the percentage of completion method, sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion. Sales and gross profit are adjusted prospectively for revisions in estimated total contract costs and contract values. Estimated losses are recognized in full when identified. Approximately 82% of our sales in 2012 were recorded at the time of shipment of the product or delivery of the service, with the remaining 18% of sales recorded using percentage of completion accounting. We have life cycle management contracts with customers to supply parts and service for terms of 1 to 17 years. These contracts are established based on the conditions the equipment will be operating in, the time horizon that the contracts will cover, and the expected operating cycle that will be required for the equipment. Based on this information, a model is created representing the projected costs and revenues of servicing the respective machines over the specified contract terms. Accounting for these contracts requires us to make various estimates, including estimates of the relevant machines long term maintenance requirements. Under these contracts, customers are generally billed monthly based on hours of operation or units of production achieved by the equipment, with the respective deferred revenues recorded when billed. Revenue is recognized in the period in which parts are supplied or services provided. These contracts are reviewed quarterly by comparison of actual results to original estimates or most recent analysis, with revenue recognition adjusted appropriately for future estimated costs. If a loss is expected at any time, the full amount of the loss is recognized immediately. We have certain customer agreements that are multiple element arrangements as defined by the Accounting Standards Codification No. 605 25, Multiple Element Arrangements. The agreements are assessed for multiple elements based on the following criteria: the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis, there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item, and the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor. Revenue is then allocated to each identified unit of accounting based on our estimate of their relative fair values. Revenue recognition involves judgments, including assessments of expected returns, the likelihood of nonpayment, and estimates of expected costs and profits on long term contracts. We analyze various factors, including a review of specific transactions, historical experience, credit worthiness of customers, and current market and economic conditions, in determining when to recognize revenue. Changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized with a resulting impact on the timing and amount of associated income. Inventories Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first in, first out method for all inventories. We evaluate the need to record valuation adjustments for inventory on a regular basis. Our policy is to evaluate all inventories including raw material, work in process, finished goods, and spare parts. Inventory in excess of our estimated usage requirements is written down to its estimated net realizable value. Inherent in the estimates of net realizable value are estimates related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, possible alternative uses, and ultimate realization of potentially excess inventory. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Intangible assets include drawings, patents, trademarks, technology, customer relationships and other specifically identifiable assets. Indefinite lived intangible assets are not being amortized. Indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes occur that suggest impairment in carrying value, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate. As part of the impairment analysis, we use the discounted cash flow model based on royalties estimated to be derived in the future use of the asset were we to license the use of the indefinite lived asset. No impairment was identified as part of 34 Table of Contents our fourth quarter impairment testing of our indefinite lived intangible assets. Finite lived intangible assets are amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed, which is principally the straight line method. Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. No impairment was identified related to our finite lived intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is assigned to specific reporting units, which we have identified as our operating segments, and tested for impairment at least annually, during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that a reporting units carrying amount is greater than its fair value. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units to their book value. We first determine, based on a qualitative assessment, whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude that this is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we determine the fair value of the reporting unit based on a discounted cash flow model. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the impairment test continues by comparing the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill to the implied fair value of goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting units identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole, as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the fair value of the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed were being determined initially. If goodwill is impaired, we recognize an impairment loss based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis. Qualitative assessments regarding goodwill involve a high degree of judgment and can entail subjective considerations. The discounted cash flow model involves many assumptions, including operating results forecasts and discount rates. Inherent in the operating results forecasts are certain assumptions regarding revenue growth rates, projected cost saving initiatives and projected long term growth rates in the determination of terminal values. We performed our goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2012 and no impairment was identified. Accrued Warranties We record accruals for potential warranty claims based on prior claim experience. Warranty costs are accrued at the time revenue is recognized. These warranty costs are based upon managements assessment of past claims and current experience. However, actual claims could be higher or lower than amounts estimated, as the amount and value of warranty claims are subject to variation as a result of many factors that cannot be predicted with certainty. Pension and Postretirement Benefits and Costs Pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. The primary assumptions include factors such as discount rates, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates and rate of compensation increases, discussed below: Discount rates: We generally estimate the discount rate for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations using a process based on a hypothetical investment in a portfolio of high quality bonds that approximate the estimated cash flows of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. We believe this approach permits a matching of future cash outflows related to benefit payments with future cash inflows associated with bond coupons and maturities. Expected return on plan assets: Our expected return on plan assets is derived from reviews of asset allocation strategies and anticipated future long term performance of individual asset classes weighted by the allocation of our plan assets. Our analysis gives appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns; however, the assumptions are primarily based on long term, prospective rates of return. 35 Table of Contents Mortality rates: Mortality rates are based on the IRS prescribed annuitant and non annuitant mortality for 2012 under the Pension Protection Act of 2006. Rate of compensation increase: The rate of compensation increase reflects our long term actual experience and its outlook, including consideration of expected rates of inflation. Actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods, and therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement plan obligations and future expense. Future changes affecting the above assumptions will change the related pension benefit or expense. As such, a 0.25% change in the discount rate and rate of return on net assets would have the following effects on projected benefit obligation and pension expense, respectively, as of and for the fiscal year ended October 26, 2012: 0.25% Increase 0.25% Decrease Expected Expected Discount long term Discount long term In thousands rate rate of return rate rate of return U.S. Pension Plans: Net pension (benefit) expense $ (1,217 ) $ (2,257 ) $ 1,190 $ 2,255 Projected (decrease) increase in benefit obligation (36,559 ) 37,662 Non U.S. Pension Plans: Net pension (benefit) expense (2,104 ) (1,299 ) 1,986 1,300 Projected (decrease) increase in benefit obligation (26,549 ) 27,599 Other Postretirement Benefit Plans: Net pension (benefit) expense (20 ) (13 ) 21 13 Projected (decrease) increase in benefit obligation (557 ) 567 Income Taxes Deferred taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current statutory tax rates. Deferred income tax provisions are based on changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities from period to period. Additionally, we analyze our ability to recognize the net deferred tax assets created in each jurisdiction in which we operate to determine if valuation allowances are necessary based on the more likely than not criteria. As required under the application of fresh start accounting, the release of pre emergence tax valuation reserves was not recorded in the income statement but instead was treated first as a reduction of excess reorganization value until exhausted, then intangibles until exhausted, and thereafter reported as additional paid in capital. Consequently, a net tax charge will be incurred in future years when these tax assets are utilized. We will continue to monitor the appropriateness of the existing valuation allowances and determine annually the amount of valuation allowances that are required to be maintained. As of October 26, 2012, there were $62.4 million of valuation allowances against pre emergence net operating loss carryforwards. All future reversals of pre emergence valuation allowances will be recorded to additional paid in capital. We estimate the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full year on an interim basis. The estimated effective tax rate contemplates the expected jurisdiction where income is earned (e.g., United States compared to non United States) as well as tax planning strategies. If the actual results are different from these estimates, adjustments to the effective tax rate may be required in the period such determination is made. Additionally, discrete items are treated separately from the effective rate analysis and are recorded 36 Table of Contents separately as an income tax provision or benefit at the time they are recognized. To the extent recognized, these items will impact the effective tax rate in aggregate but will not adjust the amount used for future periods within the same year. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes the major elements of our working capital as of: In thousands October 26, 2012 October 28, 2011 Accounts receivable $ 1,229,083 $ 884,696 Inventories 1,415,455 1,334,134 Accounts payable (452,236 ) (452,519 ) Advance payments (669,792 ) (771,841 ) Trade Working Capital $ 1,522,510 $ 994,470 Other current assets 247,666 190,568 Short term notes payable (65,316 ) (35,895 ) Employee compensation and benefits (156,867 ) (147,664 ) Accrued warranties (100,646 ) (82,737 ) Other current liabilities (322,813 ) (206,588 ) Working Capital Excluding Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 1,124,534 $ 712,154 Cash and Cash Equivalents 263,873 288,321 Working Capital $ 1,388,407 $ 1,000,475 IMM added $173.6 million to trade working capital at October 26, 2012. We currently use trade working capital and cash flow from operations as two financial measurements to evaluate the performance of our operations and our ability to meet our financial obligations. We require trade working capital investment because our service model requires us to maintain certain inventory levels in order to maximize our customers machine availability. This information also provides management with a focus on our receivable terms and collectability efforts and our ability to obtain advance payments on original equipment orders. As part of our continuous improvement of purchasing and manufacturing processes, we continue to strive for alignment of inventory levels with customer demand and current production schedules. Cash provided by continuing operations for 2012 was $463.9 million as compared to $499.7 million provided by operations for 2011. The decrease in cash provided by continuing operations was the result of increases in accounts receivables due to the timing of sales, increased inventory to support the strong sales activity, reduced accounts payable and by a reduction in advance payments resulting from a decline in new original equipment order activity. Cash provided by continuing operations was favorably impacted by increases in accrued liabilities due to a change in the timing of tax payments. Cash used by investing activities was $378.3 million in 2012 compared to $2.0 billion used by investing activities for 2011. Investing activities in 2012 primarily related to the $955.9 million investment in IMM, which was funded in the prior year with a $866.0 million cash deposit that was placed into an escrow account in anticipation of completing the IMM transaction. Investing activities in 2011 primarily related to the $1.0 billion acquisition of LeTourneau, the $376.7 million investment in IMM shares, and the $866.0 million escrow deposit for the anticipated acquisition of IMM, partially offset by the $375.0 million sale of the LeTourneau drilling business. Cash used by financing activities for 2012 was $81.6 million compared to cash provided by financing activities of $976.7 million for 2011. The difference was driven by the prior year entrance into a new $500.0 million term loan for the acquisition of LeTourneau and the prior year issuance of $500.0 million of senior notes in anticipation of completing the IMM acquisition. In 2012, financing activities consisted primarily of the borrowing and subsequent repayment of a $250.0 million note for the acquisition of IMM, as well as the payment of $74.0 million in dividends. 37 Table of Contents We expect 2013 capital spending to be approximately $200 million. Capital projects will be focused on expanding service center capabilities globally and the increase of our manufacturing capabilities in the emerging markets. During each quarter of fiscal 2012 we declared a cash dividend of $0.175 per outstanding share of common stock and we paid $74.0 million in dividends during the fiscal year. For fiscal year 2013 we expect to contribute $180.0 million to $190.0 million to our employee pension plans. As of October 26, 2012 we have a net unfunded pension and other postretirement liability of $367.0 million. We believe our liquidity and capital resources are adequate to meet our projected needs. We have $263.9 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at October 26, 2012, of which $253.7 million is held for foreign entities. We expect to meet our U.S. funding needs without repatriating undistributed profits that are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Requirements for working capital, dividends, pension contributions, capital spending, acquisitions and principal and interest payments on our term loan and senior notes will be adequately funded by cash on hand, continuing operations and supplemented by short and long term borrowings, as required. Credit Facilities and Senior Notes On October 12, 2012, we entered into a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that matures on November 12, 2017 (the Credit Agreement). Under the Credit Agreement, we also may request an increase of up to $250.0 million of additional aggregate revolving commitments, subject to terms and conditions contained in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement simultaneously replaced the $700.0 million revolving credit agreement, dated as of October 27, 2010 (the Prior Credit Agreement) that was to have matured in November 2014. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement we pay a commitment fee ranging from 0.10% to 0.325% on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility based on our credit rating. Letters of credit issued under applicable provisions of the Credit Agreement represent an unfunded utilization of the Credit Agreement for purposes of calculating the periodic commitment fee due. Eurodollar Rate Loans will bear interest for a period from the applicable borrowing date until a date one week, two weeks or one, two, three or six months thereafter, as selected by us, at the corresponding Eurodollar rate plus a margin of 1.00% to 2.00% depending upon our credit rating, and Base Rate Loans will bear interest from the applicable borrowing date at a rate equal to (i) the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, (b) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced by the administrative agent as its prime rate, and (c) a daily rate equal to the one month Eurodollar rate plus 1.0%, plus (ii) a margin that varies according to our credit rating. Swing Line Loans will bear interest at either the Base Rate described above or the Daily Floating Eurodollar Rate, which is a one month Eurodollar rate plus the applicable margin, as selected by us. The Credit Agreement requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants including leverage and interest coverage ratios. The Credit Agreement also restricts payment of dividends or other return of capital when the consolidated leverage ratio exceeds a stated level amount. At October 26, 2012, we were in compliance with all financial covenants of the Credit Agreement and had no restrictions on the payment of dividends or return of capital. In connection with our entry into the Credit Agreement, we terminated the Prior Credit Agreement and used a portion of the proceeds available under the Credit Agreement to repay our $250.0 million term loan credit agreement, dated as of October 31, 2011 (the Further Term Loan), which was to have matured in June 2016. The Further Term Loan was drawn in full on February 10, 2012, in conjunction with the settlement of the IMM tender offer. Following our entry into the Credit Agreement, all amounts outstanding under the Prior Credit Agreement and Further Term Loan were repaid in full. At October 26, 2012, there were no direct borrowings under the Credit Agreement. Outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement, which count toward the $1.0 billion credit limit, totaled $279.0 million. At October 26, 2012, there was $721.0 million available for borrowings under the Credit Agreement. 38 Table of Contents On June 16, 2011, we entered into a credit agreement, which matures June 16, 2016, and provided for a $500.0 million term loan commitment (the Term Loan), which was drawn in full to partially finance the acquisition of LeTourneau. The Term Loan requires quarterly principal payments that began in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011. The Term Loan contains terms and conditions that are substantially similar to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement. The Term Loan is guaranteed by each of our current and future material domestic subsidiaries and requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants, including leverage and interest coverage ratios. At October 26, 2012, we were in compliance with all financial covenants of the Term Loan. On October 12, 2011, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 5.125% Senior Notes due in 2021 (the 2021 Notes) at a discount of $4.2 million in an offering that was registered under the Securities Act. Interest on the 2021 Notes is paid semi annually in arrears on October 15 and April 15 of each year and the 2021 Notes are guaranteed by each of our current and future material domestic subsidiaries. At our option, we may redeem some or all of the 2021 Notes at a redemption price of the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the principal amounts and the remaining scheduled interest payments using a discount rate equal to the sum of a Treasury rate of a comparable Treasury issue plus 0.5%. In November 2006, we issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.0% Senior Notes due 2016 and $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.625% Senior Notes due 2036 (Notes). Interest on the Notes is paid semi annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year and the Notes are guaranteed by each of our current and future material domestic subsidiaries. The Notes were issued in a private placement under an exemption from registration provided by the Securities Act. In the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the Notes were exchanged for substantially identical notes in an exchange that was registered under the Securities Act. At our option, we may redeem some or all of the Notes at a redemption price of the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the principal amounts and the remaining scheduled interest payments using a discount rate equal to the sum of a treasury rate of a comparable treasury issue plus 0.3% for the 2016 Notes and 0.375% for the 2036 Notes. Advance Payments and Progress Billings As part of the negotiation process associated with original equipment orders, advance payments and contracts generally require progress payments from our customers to support the procurement of inventory and other resources. As of October 26, 2012, advance payments and progress billings were $669.8 million. As orders are shipped or costs incurred, the advanced payments and progress billings are recognized as revenue in the consolidated income statement. Retiree Benefits We sponsor pension plans in both the U.S. and other countries. The significance of the funding requirements of these plans are largely dependent on the actual value of the plan assets, the investment returns on the plan assets, actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, and the impact of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. In the second quarter of 2012 a modification was made to the Joy Global Pension Plan freezing benefits for all salaried and non bargained hourly participants effective May 1, 2012. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2012 a modification was made to the Joy Global Pension Plan freezing benefits for certain bargained hourly participants effective in 2013. We recorded curtailment charges of $1.1 million and $10.4 million in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2012, respectively, in conjunction with the freezes. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We lease various assets under operating leases. The aggregate payments under operating leases as of October 26, 2012 are disclosed in the table of Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments below. No significant changes to lease commitments have occurred during 2012. We have no other off balance sheet arrangements. 39 Table of Contents Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of October 26, 2012: Less Than 1 3 3 5 More than In thousands Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Long Term Debt* $ 1,905,731 $ 100,988 $ 202,048 $ 656,414 $ 946,281 Capital Lease Obligations* 45 45 Purchase Obligations 84,480 56,802 27,054 624 Operating Leases 121,392 34,613 48,340 23,071 15,368 Other Long Term Obligations** 89,166 72,943 4,382 3,981 7,860 $ 2,200,814 $ 265,391 $ 281,824 $ 684,090 $ 969,509 * Includes interest ** Includes minimum required contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans and required contributions for our unfunded other postretirement benefit plans. New Accounting Pronouncements Our new accounting pronouncements are set forth under Item 15 Exhibits and Financial Statements Schedules of this annual report and are incorporated herein by reference. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to fluctuations in earnings and cash flows due to volatility in interest rates, commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. We monitor our risks on a continuous basis and generally enter into derivative instruments to minimize our foreign currency exposures. We do not engage in speculation in our derivative strategy. We assess effectiveness of our hedging relationships on an ongoing basis to ensure the transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of the hedged item. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long term debt obligations. We have a combination of fixed and variable rate debt (See Note 10, Borrowings and Credit Facilities) and interest rate movements impact the value of fixed rate debt and cash flows on variable rate debt. At October 26, 2012, we were not party to any interest rate derivative contracts. Commodity Price Risk We purchase certain raw materials, including steel and copper, that are subject to price volatility caused by systematic risks. Although future movements in raw material prices are unpredictable, we manage this risk through periodic purchases of raw materials and passing some or all price increases to our customers. At October 26, 2012, we were not a party to any commodity forward contracts. 40 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Risk We have a risk averse Foreign Exchange Risk Management Policy under which significant exposures that impact earnings and cash flows are hedged. Exposures that impact only equity or do not have a cash flow impact are generally not hedged with derivatives. We hedge two categories of foreign exchange exposures: assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency, which include future committed receipts or payments denominated in a foreign currency, and certain U.S. functional currency entity balance sheet accounts denominated in local currencies. These exposures normally arise from the import and export of goods and from intercompany trade and lending activity. For consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities are translated at month end exchange rates and income and expense are translated at average exchange rates. Translation gains and losses on asset and liabilities are not included in determining net income (loss) but are accumulated as a separate component of shareholders equity. Exchange gains or losses incurred on transactions conducted by one of our operations in a currency other than the operations functional currency are included in determining net income (loss). During 2012, we realized a loss of $1.4 million arising from foreign currency transactions. Foreign exchange derivatives at October 26, 2012 were in the form of forward exchange contracts executed over the counter. The fair value of our forward exchange contracts at October 26, 2012 is analyzed in the following table of dollar equivalent terms: Fair Value In thousands Buy Sell Australian Dollar $ 5 $ 11 British Pound Sterling 4,466 (1,124 ) Canadian Dollar (6 ) 274 Chilean Peso (19 ) 791 Euro 118 16 Japanese Yen (20 ) Polish Zloty 230 South African Rand (735 ) 109 U.S. Dollar 460 5,110 Total $ 4,499 $ 5,187 41 Table of Contents
