Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The information required under this item is included in the following section of the Companys 2001 Annual Report to Shareholders, which section is incorporated by reference herein from Exhibit 13.1 of this report: Managements Discussion and Analysis Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates. In seeking to minimize risk, the Company manages exposure through its regular operating and financing activities. The Company does not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and is not party to any leveraged financial instruments. The Company manages interest rate exposure through its mix of fixed and variable rate borrowings. Short term borrowing and investing activities generally bear interest at variable rates, but because they have maturities of three months or less, the Company believes that the risk of material loss is low, and that the carrying amount approximates fair value. In addition, the Company has outstanding at January 31, 2002 a variable rate construction loan obligation and $300 million of 8.95% fixed rate debt converted to variable rate through the use of an interest rate swap. The Company is currently refinancing the construction loan obligation and expects the agreement to close in April 2002 with a fixed interest rate. The interest rate swap reduces interest payments on the Companys highest fixed rate debt by taking advantage of the current low interest rates. A shift in future interest rates could adversely affect the amount of interest paid through this swap agreement. 10 of 22 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (continued) The majority of the Companys revenue, expense and capital expenditures are transacted in United States dollars. However, the Company periodically enters into foreign currency purchase orders for apparel and shoes denominated in Euros.
