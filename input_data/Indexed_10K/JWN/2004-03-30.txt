Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. The information required under this item is included in the following section of our 2003 Annual Report to Shareholders, which section is incorporated by reference herein from Exhibit 13.1 of this report: Managements Discussion and Analysis Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates. In seeking to minimize risk, we manage exposure through our regular operating and financing activities. We do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and are not party to any leveraged financial instruments. Interest rate exposure is managed through our mix of fixed and variable rate borrowings. Short term borrowing and investing activities generally bear interest at variable rates, but because they have maturities of three months or less, we believe that the risk of material loss is low, and that the carrying amount approximated fair value. During 2003, we converted our $250 million 5.63% fixed rate debt to variable rate through the use of an interest rate swap. Under the agreement, we received a fixed rate of 5.63% and paid a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a margin of 2.3% set at six month intervals (3.945% at January 31, 2004). The swap will expire in 2009. Page 10 of 30 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (continued) In 2002 and 2003, we received $4.9 million and $2.3 million for the sale of two interest rate swaps. The first swap converted our $300 million, 8.95% fixed rate debt to variable rate, while the second swap converted our $250 million, 5.63% fixed rate debt to variable rate. The cash proceeds from each of the swaps will be recognized as interest income evenly over the remaining life of the related debt. The table below presents information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, which consist of debt obligations and interest rate swaps for the year ended January 31, 2004. For debt obligations, the table presents principal amounts, at book value, by maturity date, and related weighted average interest rates. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected (contractual) maturity dates. Notional amounts are the predetermined dollar principal on which the exchanged interest payments are based.

However, we periodically enter into foreign currency purchase orders for apparel and shoes denominated in Euros. We use forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices. The fair value of our outstanding forward contracts at January 31, 2004 was not material. The use of derivatives is limited to only those financial instruments that have been authorized by our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. In addition, the functional currency of Faonnable, S.A.S. of Nice, France is the Euro. Assets and liabilities of Faonnable are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing at the end of the period. Income and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars at an average exchange rate during the period. Foreign currency gains and losses from the translation of Faonnables balance sheet and income statement are included in other comprehensive earnings. Foreign currency gains or losses from certain intercompany loans are recorded in service charge income and other, net. We considered the potential impact of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates and we believe that such a change would not have a material impact on our cash flows of financial instruments that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange risk. The model measured the change in cash flows arising from the 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates, and covered long term debt denominated in Euros. Page 11 of 30 Table of Contents Item 7A.
