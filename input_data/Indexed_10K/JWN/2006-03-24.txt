Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. Nordstrom is a fashion specialty retailer offering high quality apparel, shoes, cosmetics and accessories for women, men and children. We offer a wide selection of brand name and private label merchandise. We offer our products through multiple retail channels including our Full Line Nordstrom stores, our discount Nordstrom Rack stores, our Faonnable boutiques, our catalogs and on the Internet at www.nordstrom.com. Our stores are located throughout the United States and we have 32 Faonnable boutiques located in France, Portugal, and Belgium. In addition, we offer our customers a variety of payment products and services including our loyalty program. STRATEGIC INITIATIVES FOR 2006 Our long term goal is to deliver industry leading performance, and we continue to focus on driving top line growth, gaining operational efficiencies and developing leaders for future growth. This mindset has served us well over the last few years as we have generated same store sales growth and improved our gross profit and selling, general, and administrative rates. Our 2006 initiatives maintain the same focus but also recognize the developments in our business and the marketplace. Drive Top Line Growth Our top priority is to gain market share through existing stores and channels, as well as from new Full Line stores. Our success in accomplishing this goal starts and ends with the experience each customer has in our stores. We believe the essence of this experience is desirable products coupled with personalized service. Our ongoing focus revolves around these two key elements of our business as we believe they are an integral part of long term success. For 2006, we have identified three specific areas of focus to drive top line growth: re energizing womens apparel, multi channel integration and enhancing our designer business. Womens Apparel Womens apparel represents about one third of our total sales and serves a wide range of individual tastes and styles. In 2005, we started to develop more targeted merchandising strategies for our womens departments. A thorough analysis of objective customer information combined with the feedback from our selling floor has helped us to better understand our customers needs and shopping priorities in terms of style, price, fit and occasion. We have carefully reorganized our merchant teams and are in the process of fine tuning our offerings to better serve our customers. Multi Channel Integration Our goal is to create a more integrated, consistent merchandise offering for our customers, whether they choose to shop in our Full Line stores, on the Internet or through our catalogs. As described in Multi Channel Strategy Execution on page 6, we initiated the integration in 2005. In 2006 we will begin migrating the Direct inventory system onto our Full Line store platform, creating a one company view of inventory resulting in a more seamless merchandise offering and experience for our customer. This process is expected to continue through 2008. Designer Our womens designer category has been a strong performer and contributes significantly to the aspirational nature of our brand. Our goal is to have a complete designer offering in at least one store for every major market we serve. In addition, we are focused on enhancing and aligning our designer offering across all major merchandise categories. In August 2005, we purchased a majority interest in Jeffrey, a luxury specialty store business with stores in New York City and Atlanta, and named the founder, President and CEO of Jeffrey, Mr. Jeffrey Kalinsky, Director of Designer Merchandising at Nordstrom. Along with our merchant team, were utilizing Mr. Kalinskys expertise and creativity in the designer business to further our current designer strategies. Additionally, we launched a designer Web site in February 2006, which offers designer apparel, footwear and accessories. Continue to Gain Operational Efficiencies As we drive top line growth, we seek to expand our gross profit and reduce our selling, general and administrative rates by minimizing the increases to our buying, occupancy, general and administrative costs. This approach has been successful over the past three years, as we have controlled these costs while we supported our same store sales growth. We are committed to keeping our technology investments current and relevant to our business needs. This includes investing in ongoing maintenance and system enhancements as well as replacing older applications as the opportunities present themselves. This is an ongoing part of our overall technology investment strategy. We anticipate additional rate improvement from our buying and corporate organization as we enhance our processes and expand the use of our systems to support our future sales growth. Leadership Development and Succession Planning At Nordstrom, we are committed to developing the best talent in retail. The training and development of our future leaders is critical to our long term growth. To that end, we have identified potential successors for all major leadership roles. We have also piloted with 35 executives a leadership development program designed to increase specifically identified leadership skills. This program includes identifying each leaders development needs and includes personal coaching as well as interactive group learning. This program will be rolled out to approximately 90 leaders by the end of 2006 with plans to train more individuals over the next few years. 14 Table of Contents OVERVIEW In 2005, our same store sales increased 6.0% on top of our 8.5% increase in 2004. These increases are our two highest annual same store sales growth results in the past 10 years. Some other retailers who combine an offering of compelling merchandise and customer service have also experienced positive sales growth. Our merchandise and selling costs increased in line with our same store sales, but our other costs, including buying and occupancy costs and non selling labor, remained relatively consistent with last year. As a result of our same store sales growth and expense performance, we experienced a significant increase in our operating income. Our earnings before income tax expense as a percentage of net sales was 11.5% in 2005, the first year that it exceeded 10.0% since we first issued stock to the public in 1971. In addition, our diluted earnings per share increased 43.5% to $1.98. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales (Dollars in Millions) Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Net sales $7,722.9 $7,131.4 $6,448.7 Net sales increase 8.3% 10.6% 8.5% Same store sales increase 6.0% 8.5% 4.1% Percentage of net sales by merchandise category: Womens apparel 35% 36% 36% Shoes 21% 20% 20% Cosmetics and womens accessories 20% 20% 19% Mens apparel 18% 18% 17% Childrens apparel 3% 3% 4% Other 3% 3% 4% 2005 VS 2004 NET SALES In our Full Line stores, our accessories, cosmetics and mens apparel merchandise categories experienced the largest same store sales increases. Our shoe divisions had same store sales increases. Our womens apparel merchandise category had mixed same store sales performance; womens intimate, junior and contemporary apparel were the leaders in the womens category, while womens special sizes, better and bridge apparel had same store sales decreases in 2005. Our Rack same store sales increased 14.8% in 2005, on top of last years 13.2% increase. Our sales increase was driven by the Racks merchandise mix, especially our ability to offer customers branded merchandise. Nordstrom Directs 2005 sales, including shipping revenue, decreased by 2.5%. Internet sales increased 40.7%. In February 2005, we reduced our shipping fees, which drove additional Internet sales but reduced our overall shipping revenue. Nordstrom Directs 2005 sales, excluding shipping revenue, improved by 2.4% compared to 2004. As part of the multi channel strategy (see page 6), we reduced our Direct catalog mailings significantly beginning in July 2005 and we shifted the merchandise offering to be more aligned with the Full Line stores. The decrease in the number of Direct catalog mailings, along with a continuing shift of catalog customers to the Internet, resulted in a drop in catalog sales in 2005. Total net sales increased as a result of our same store sales increases as well as from the six Full Line stores opened since February 2004. 2004 VS 2003 NET SALES Our net sales increased as our customers responded positively to our merchandise offerings. Both our Full Line and Rack stores had overall and same store sales increases. All of our geographic regions and major merchandise categories also reported overall and same store sales increases. The strongest performing areas were accessories, womens shoes and womens better apparel, followed by womens designer and mens apparel. Total net sales also benefited from the six Full Line stores and two Rack stores opened since February 2003, increasing our retail square footage 5% during the last two years. Sales at Nordstrom Direct increased 30.9% due to Internet customer order growth and an improved customer order fulfillment rate. Internet sales increased 53.1% due to an increase in the rate of Web site visits that result in sales and increased Internet advertising. Catalog net sales decreased in 2004 by 3%, which is consistent with our strategy to shift catalog customers to the Internet. 2006 FORECAST OF SAME STORE SALES In March 2006, we opened one Full Line store; later in 2006, we plan to open one Rack store and relocate one existing Full Line store, increasing retail square footage by approximately 1%. We expect 2006 same store sales to increase 1% to 3%. Nordstrom, Inc. and subsidiaries 15 Table of Contents Gross Profit (Dollars in Millions Except Per Square Foot Amounts) Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Gross profit $2,834.8 $2,572.0 $2,233.1 Gross profit rate 36.7% 36.1% 34.6% Average inventory per square foot $51.25 $52.46 $54.81 Inventory turnover 4.84 4.51 4.10 2005 VS 2004 GROSS PROFIT While we showed growth in our same store sales, we held buying and occupancy costs relatively consistent with last year. In addition, our merchandise costs increased in line with our sales increases. As a result, we drove a gross profit rate improvement of 60 basis points. We continue our efforts to improve inventory management while providing fresh and compelling merchandise to our customers. We utilized existing and new technology to gain greater visibility into our sales trends and inventory position. Our merchant teams used these tools to expand their analysis of our sales and on hand content to drive sales growth and increase our inventory turnover rate. 2004 VS 2003 GROSS PROFIT In 2004, the improvement in our gross profit rate was primarily a result of meeting our customers desire for fresh, compelling merchandise, which increased the sales of regular priced merchandise. In addition, gross profit benefited from our ongoing improvement in managing inventory and by holding buying costs and the fixed portion of occupancy expenses flat. Contributing to our gross profit rate improvement was the continuous improvement we are making utilizing our perpetual inventory system investment, which we made in 2003. We have better visibility into sales trends and on hand content, allowing us to more effectively manage our merchandise; the result was a significant improvement in our inventory turnover rate. Increased sell through of regular priced merchandise reduced the markdowns necessary to sell slow moving goods. We maintained our inventory at levels consistent with the prior year, even though our sales and square footage grew in 2004. The overall improvements in merchandise management have generated higher margins on our inventory investments. 2006 FORECAST OF GROSS PROFIT In 2006, if we achieve our planned same store sales growth, we expect a net 10 to 20 basis point improvement in our gross profit rate from continued sales leverage on buying and occupancy costs. This includes an estimated 15 basis point decrease to our 2006 gross profit rate when we adopt SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (Dollars in Millions) Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Selling, general and administrative expenses $2,100.7 $2,020.2 $1,899.1 Selling, general and administrative rate 27.2% 28.3% 29.4% 2005 VS 2004 SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES The primary component of our selling, general and administrative expenses that varies with our same store sales is our selling costs. Most of our other expenses do not fluctuate with changes in our same store sales. In 2005, as our same store sales increased 6.0%, we held our general and administrative expenses essentially in line with 2004, which resulted in a 110 basis point decrease in our selling, general and administrative rate. This is our second year in a row that the combination of our net sales increases and control of our general and administrative costs has given us an improvement in the selling, general and administrative rate of over 100 basis points. 2004 VS 2003 SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES We continued to use our infrastructure to support increased sales. In 2004, our selling, general and administrative rate improved 110 basis points. We were able to control and leverage our fixed general and administrative expenses, especially non selling labor. While selling expense increased in 2004, primarily from higher costs linked to increased sales, we experienced a slight rate improvement in selling expense as a percentage of net sales. 2006 FORECAST OF SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES In 2006, our selling, general and administrative rate is expected to improve overall by 10 to 20 basis points, primarily from continued sales leverage on general and administrative expenses. This includes an estimated 20 basis point increase to our 2006 selling, general and administrative rate when we adopt SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. 16 Table of Contents Interest Expense, Net (Dollars in Millions) Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Interest expense, net $45.3 $77.4 $91.0 2005 VS 2004 INTEREST EXPENSE, NET Interest expense, net decreased $32.1 million in 2005 compared to 2004. The decrease is primarily due to debt prepayment costs of $20.9 million incurred in 2004 in connection with a $198.2 million debt buyback. We did not incur similar costs in 2005. 2004 VS 2003 INTEREST EXPENSE, NET We prepaid debt of $198.2 million in 2004 and $105.7 million in 2003. We incurred debt prepayment costs of $20.9 million in 2004 and $14.3 million in 2003. The decrease in our interest expense, net in 2004 was due to the reduction in our 2004 average outstanding debt, partially offset by the increase in the prepayment costs. 2006 FORECAST OF INTEREST EXPENSE, NET We expect a reduction in interest expense, net of approximately $8 to $10 million due to higher interest income. This forecasted interest expense can vary based upon the rate of our share repurchases, which affects our cash on hand and the related interest income, and the variable portion of our long term debt. Although the majority of our debt has fixed interest rates, we currently hold an interest rate swap agreement on our $250.0 million 5.625% senior notes due in January 2009, where we receive a fixed rate of 5.625% and pay a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a margin of 2.3% set at six month intervals (7.09% at January 28, 2006). Other Income Including Finance Charges, Net (Dollars in Millions) Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Other income including finance charges, net $196.4 $172.9 $155.1 Other income including finance charges, net as a percentage of net sales 2.5% 2.4% 2.4% 2005 VS 2004 OTHER INCOME INCLUDING FINANCE CHARGES, NET Other income including finance charges, net increased $23.4 million, due to earnings growth in the Nordstrom fsb co branded VISA credit card program and our gift card breakage income of $8.0 million. The principal balances of receivables in the VISA credit card, which are held by a separate trust in which we hold a certificated interest, increased 20.6% during 2005. The receivables growth increase, which is mostly funded by our operating cash flows, produces an increase in the trusts earnings. Our income from the program increased primarily because of this growth in the co branded receivables program. Gift card breakage income is a new component of income in 2005. Unclaimed property legislation changed in 2004 to allow us to retain unused balances on gift cards. We analyzed the experience of our program since it was introduced in 1999, and we determined that balances remaining on cards issued five years ago are unlikely to be redeemed. The breakage income recognized in 2005 includes $2.6 million and $5.4 million for cards issued in 1999 and 2000; in both cases, the breakage income is 3.4% of the amount issued as gift cards in those years. 2004 VS 2003 OTHER INCOME INCLUDING FINANCE CHARGES, NET Our overall other income including finance charges, net increased $17.9 million, primarily from our co branded VISA credit card program growth. Since 2002, we marketed this credit card to our in store customers and the inactive Nordstrom private label credit card holders. These marketing efforts showed success in 2004, as the co branded VISA credit card holders used the cards more extensively in 2004, resulting in a 45.7% volume increase. 2006 FORECAST OF OTHER INCOME INCLUDING FINANCE CHARGES, NET In 2006, other income including finance charges, net is expected to increase approximately $25 to $30 million as we continue to see growth in our VISA credit card program and corresponding income. Nordstrom, Inc. and subsidiaries 17 Table of Contents Income Tax Expense (Dollars in Millions) Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Income tax expense $333.9 $253.8 $155.3 Effective tax rate 37.7% 39.2% 39.0% 2005 VS 2004 INCOME TAX EXPENSE Our expected effective tax rate, considering the federal tax rate of 35.0% and the net effect of state income taxes, is 38.5%. In 2005, our actual effective tax rate was below this rate because our 2004 tax expense, which was finalized in the third quarter of 2005, was less than we expected; we reduced our reserve when the audits of our 2000 and 2001 federal tax returns were completed; and, we utilized a larger than previously estimated amount of our capital loss carryforward. 2004 VS 2003 INCOME TAX EXPENSE Our effective tax rate in 2004 increased from the 2003 rate because we recorded a valuation allowance for a portion of a capital loss carryforward which we deemed to be unrealizable. 2006 FORECAST OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE In 2006, we expect our effective tax rate to be 38.5%. Net Earnings and Diluted Earnings Per Share (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Net earnings $551.3 $393.5 $242.8 Net earnings as a percentage of net sales 7.1% 5.5% 3.8% Diluted earnings per share $1.98 $1.38 $0.88 2005 VS 2004 NET EARNINGS AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE In 2005, net earnings increased 40.1% and diluted earnings per share increased 43.5% as a result of our same store sales growth and sales leverage on buying and occupancy and general and administrative expenses. In 2004, we incurred prepayment costs and wrote off deferred debt costs totaling $20.9 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, upon prepayment of $198.2 million of long term debt. We did not incur similar costs in 2005. 2004 VS 2003 NET EARNINGS AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE In 2004, earnings per share increased to $1.38 from $0.88 in 2003. This increase was driven by a strong increase in overall and same store sales, improvements in gross profit through better inventory management, and sales leverage on buying and occupancy and selling, general and administrative expenses. 2006 FORECAST OF DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE We expect our diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.15 to $2.23 in 2006, which includes an estimated annual expense of $0.06 per diluted share from the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment in the first quarter of 2006. Fourth Quarter Results Net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2005 were $190.4 million compared with $140.0 million in 2004. Total sales for the quarter increased 9.3% to $2.3 billion and same store sales increased by 5.8%. Our cosmetics, accessories and mens apparel merchandise categories experienced the largest same store sales increases. Our shoe divisions had same store sales increases. Our womens apparel merchandise categories had mixed same store sales performance. Womens intimate and contemporary apparel were the leaders in the womens category, while womens special sizes, bridge and better apparel had same store sales decreases in 2005. Our gross profit rate increased to 37.5% from 36.6% last year. Our womens apparel category experienced a reduction in gross profit rate, but this was offset by improvement in the mens apparel and accessories categories. The quarterly improvement in our gross profit rate resulted from leverage on our buying and occupancy expenses. Our selling, general and administrative rate improved 70 basis points from 26.9% to 26.2%, primarily from leverage on our general and administrative expenses. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overall, cash increased by $102.0 million to $462.7 million as of January 28, 2006 due primarily to the increase in our net earnings in 2005. We utilized our cash flow from operations for capital expenditures, to repay debt and to return capital to our shareholders through dividends and repurchases of our common stock. 18 Table of Contents Operating Activities 2005 VS 2004 OPERATING ACTIVITIES Net cash flow from operating activities increased from $606.3 million to $776.2 million, an increase of $169.9 million primarily due to the growth in our net earnings. We continue to see growth in our co branded VISA credit card program, and as a result we have increased the capital we allocate to fund this program. Under our co branded VISA program, we earn interchange and finance charge income and we offer card holders merchandise certificates, which can be redeemed in our stores, similar to a gift certificate. Our operating cash flows have been sufficient over the past three years to support the annual growth of this program, and we expect additional growth in 2006 also will be funded from our operations. A key tool that we use to manage our inventory is our perpetual inventory system. In 2005, we reduced our average inventory per square foot by 2.3%. We use our perpetual inventory system to identify sales trends quickly, so we can enhance additional sales opportunities and increase inventory turnover. In the course of negotiating for store locations, some developers offer up front cash payments to defray our capital expenditures in exchange for our commitment to operate a store in their development. In 2005, we received $49.5 million of these incentives, which is a $29.6 million increase over 2004. Property incentive receipts vary year to year, depending on the number of our store openings and remodels and the arrangements we negotiate with developers. 2004 VS 2003 OPERATING ACTIVITIES In 2004, net cash flow from operating activities increased to $606.3 million, a $7.1 million increase. Higher net earnings was offset by our merchandise purchase and payment flow changes in 2004 as compared to 2003 and the timing of income tax payments. Toward the end of 2003 and into 2004, we achieved a more even flow of merchandise purchases in relation to our sales trends. Our 2004 inventory turns have improved over the prior year; the payables leverage we achieved in 2004 is consistent with our merchandise purchase plan. Income tax payments have increased in 2004 as a result of our earnings growth. 2006 FORECAST FOR OPERATING ACTIVITIES In 2006, cash flows provided by operating activities are expected to increase slightly as a result of increased net earnings. Investing Activities In the past three years, we have had two principal types of investing activities: capital expenditures and short term investments. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES The changes in the level of our capital expenditures from year to year partially correlate to the number of stores opened in each year: Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Capital expenditures (in millions) $271.7 $246.9 $258.3 Stores opened: Full Line 4 2 4 Rack 2 In 2005, we opened four Full Line stores: at Phipps Plaza in Atlanta, Georgia; at The Shops at La Cantera in San Antonio, Texas; at the Irvine Spectrum Center in Irvine, California; and at the NorthPark Center in Dallas, Texas. Gross square footage for the year increased approximately 3.5%, from 19,397,000 to 20,070,000. In 2005, 40% of our capital expenditures was for new stores and 30% was for remodels. In addition, 15% of our capital expenditures was for information technology and 15% for other routine projects. Our capital expenditures over the last three years totaled $776.8 million. These capital expenditures were offset by property incentives of $115.3 million. With these capital expenditures, we added stores, enhanced existing facilities and improved our information systems. More than 1.6 million square feet of retail store space have been added during this period, representing an increase of 9% since January 31, 2003. We expect that our capital expenditures will be $1.5 billion over the next three years, with $319 million planned for 2006. These future capital expenditures are expected to be offset partially by property incentives of $230 million. We plan to use 50% of this investment to build new stores, 25% on remodels, 10% on information technology and 15% for smaller, store related improvements. Compared to the previous three years, capital expenditures will increase 94%, with increased spending allocated to new stores. The estimated capital project spending does not include potential investments in new stores resulting from the current industry consolidation. We believe we have the capacity to address additional capital investments should opportunities arise. As of January 28, 2006, we were contractually committed to spend $567.5 million for constructing new stores, remodeling existing stores, and other capital projects. Nordstrom, Inc. and subsidiaries 19 Table of Contents SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS We reduced our holdings of our short term investments in 2004 when we repurchased $198.2 million of long term debt. In 2005, our short term investment balances have been more consistent. We evaluate a number of short term investment options, with a variety of yields and liquidity restrictions. Consistent with our investment policy, we invest our excess cash in high quality short term investments. Some of these investments are classified as cash equivalents while others are classified as short term investments; changes in the investment mix, while not significant to our overall short term investing activities, can impact our net cash flows from investing activities. Financing Activities Over the past three years, our net operating cash flows have exceeded our net investing activities, and we used this excess cash flow to repay long term debt, pay dividends, and to repurchase our common stock in 2004 and 2005. Over this three year period, the price of our common stock has increased, which spurred stock option exercises that also increased our net cash. We have not utilized our short term borrowing facilities during the past three years. DEBT REPURCHASE The following table outlines our debt retirement activity (in millions): Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Principal repaid or retired: Senior notes, 8.95%, due 2005 $196.8 $103.2 Notes payable, 6.7%, due 2005 $96.0 $1.5 $2.5 Total $96.0 $198.3 $105.7 Total cash payment $96.0 $220.1 $120.8 We repaid the remaining $96.0 million of our 6.7% medium term notes when they matured in 2005. The cash payments in 2004 and 2003 that exceeded the principal retired represent early prepayment premiums. In October 2006, our $300.0 million 4.82% Private Label Securitization will mature. We intend to borrow the funds necessary to repay the Securitization with a combination of our existing borrowing capacity and additional borrowing capacity that we expect to put in place before October 2006. In the first quarter of 2007, we intend to establish a new securitization program that includes the private label and co branded Visa cards. SHARE REPURCHASE In August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized $300.0 million of share repurchases, replacing a previous share repurchase authorization. By the end of 2004, we purchased 13.8 million shares in the open market for the entire authorized amount of $300.0 million at an average price of $21.71 per share. In February 2005, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $500.0 million of share repurchases. The actual number and timing of share repurchases will be subject to market conditions and applicable SEC rules. We entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with Goldman, Sachs Co. in September 2005 to repurchase shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $100.0 million. We purchased 2.6 million shares of our common stock on September 8, 2005 at $38.77 per share. Under the terms of the agreement, we received 0.1 million additional shares in March 2006 based on the volume weighted average price of our common stock from September 8, 2005 to March 3, 2006. Overall for 2005, we purchased 8.5 million shares for $287.1 million at an average price of $33.80 per share. We expect to utilize the remaining authorization of $212.9 million in the first half of 2006. Debt to Capital Ratio Our recent favorable operating results increased our shareholders equity and allowed us to reduce our long term debt, which contributed to a decrease in our debt to capital ratio from 43.0% at the end of 2003 to 30.9% at the end of 2005. We believe that a debt to capital ratio in the range of 25% to 40% results in favorable debt ratings and provides appropriate flexibility and a reasonable cost of capital. Off Balance Sheet Financing We transfer our Nordstrom co branded VISA credit card receivables to a third party trust that issued $200 million of VISA receivable backed securities to third parties in 2002; those securities mature in April 2007. The outstanding balance of the co branded VISA credit card receivables exceeds the receivable backed securities balance. As a result, we hold securities that represent our beneficial interests in the trust, recorded as investment in asset backed securities in our consolidated balance sheets. We do not record the $200.0 million of VISA receivable backed securities or the co branded Nordstrom VISA credit card receivables transferred to the trust on our consolidated balance sheets. In the past, this off balance sheet financing provided us a cost effective source of capital. See Note 8 for a further description of our off balance sheet financing activities, including the amounts of income and cash flows arising from the arrangement and the amounts of our beneficial interests. 20 Table of Contents Interest Rate Swaps To manage our interest rate risk, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in 2003, which had a $250.0 million notional amount expiring in January 2009. Under the agreement, we receive a fixed rate of 5.63% and pay a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a margin of 2.3% set at six month intervals (7.09% at January 28, 2006). The interest rate swap agreement had a fair value of $(11.1) million and $(7.8) million at the end of 2005 and 2004. Contractual Obligations (Dollars in Millions) The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and the expected effect on our liquidity and cash flows. We expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business and credit available to us under existing and potential future facilities. Less than More than Total 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years 5 years Long term debt $1,136.1 $305.8 $461.5 $11.0 $357.8 Capital lease obligations 15.5 2.0 3.9 2.6 7.0 Operating leases 680.6 73.4 143.8 131.4 332.0 Purchase obligations 1,469.9 996.6 379.0 71.2 23.1 Other long term liabilities 196.9 30.0 39.9 19.2 107.8 Total $3,499.0 $1,407.8 $1,028.1 $235.4 $827.7 Long term debt includes financing related to the $200.0 million off balance sheet receivable backed securities due in April 2007. In addition to the required debt repayments disclosed above, we estimate total interest payments of approximately $576.6 million as of January 28, 2006, payable over the remaining life of the debts. Purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for unreceived goods or services and capital expenditure commitments. Other long term liabilities consist of workers compensation and general liability insurance reserves and postretirement benefits. The repayment amounts presented above were determined based on historical payment trends. Other long term liabilities not requiring cash payments, such as deferred property incentives, were excluded from the table above. This table also excludes the short term liabilities, other than the current portion of long term debt, disclosed on our 2005 balance sheet as the amounts recorded for these items will be paid in the next year. Credit Capacity and Commitments The following table summarizes our amount of commitment expiration per period (in millions): Total Amounts Less than More than Committed 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years 5 years Other commercial commitments $500.0 unsecured line of credit, none outstanding $150.0 variable funding note, none outstanding Standby letters of credit $11.2 $11.2 Import letters of credit $19.5 $19.5 Total $30.7 $30.7 In November 2005, we replaced our existing $350.0 million unsecured line of credit with a $500.0 million unsecured line of credit, which is available as liquidity support for our commercial paper program. Under the terms of the agreement, we pay a variable rate of interest and a commitment fee based on our debt rating. Based upon our current debt rating, we pay a variable rate of interest of LIBOR plus a margin of 0.225% (4.793% at January 28, 2006) on the outstanding balance and an annual commitment fee of 0.075% on the total capacity. The variable rate of interest increases to LIBOR plus a margin of 0.325% if more than $250.0 million is outstanding on the facility. The line of credit expires in November 2010, and contains restrictive covenants, which include maintaining a leverage ratio. We have a variable funding note backed by Nordstrom private label card and VISA credit card receivables with a borrowing capacity of $150.0 million. The annual renewal of this note requires both our approval and our issuing banks approval and interest is paid based on the actual cost of commercial paper plus specified fees of 0.15% (4.66% as of January 28, 2006). We also pay a commitment fee of 0.15% for the note based on the amount of the commitment. The facility can be cancelled or not renewed if our debt ratings fall below Standard and Poors BB rating or Moodys Ba1 rating. We did not make any borrowings under our unsecured line of credit or our variable funding note backed by Nordstrom private label card receivables during the three years ended January 28, 2006. We also have universal shelf registrations on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to offer an additional $450.0 million of securities to the public. These registration statements allow us to issue various types of securities, including debt, common stock, warrants to purchase common stock, warrants to purchase debt securities and warrants to purchase or sell foreign currency. Nordstrom, Inc. and subsidiaries 21 Table of Contents Debt Ratings The following table shows our credit ratings at the date of this report: Standard Credit Ratings Moodys and Poors Senior unsecured debt Baa1 A Commercial paper P 2 A 2 Outlook Stable Positive watch These ratings could change depending on our performance and other factors. Our outstanding debt is not subject to termination or interest rate adjustments based on changes in our credit ratings. Dividends In 2005, we paid dividends of $0.32 per share, the ninth consecutive year that our annual dividends increased. We paid dividends of $0.24 and $0.205 in 2004 and 2003. In determining the amount of dividends to pay, we analyze our dividend payout ratio and our dividend yield and balance the dividend payment with our operating performance and capital resources. We target a dividend payout ratio of approximately 18% to 20% of net income, although the ratio has been slightly lower the last two years as a result of the significant increase in our net earnings. For the dividend yield, which is calculated as our dividends per share divided by our stock price, we target a 1% long term yield. While we plan to increase dividends over time, we will balance future increases with our operating performance and available capital resources. Liquidity We maintain a level of liquidity to allow us to cover our seasonal cash needs and to minimize our need for short term borrowings. We believe that our operating cash flows, existing cash and available credit facilities are sufficient to finance our cash requirements for the next 12 months. In October 2006, we plan to repay our $300.0 million 4.82% Private Label Securitization with proceeds from a combination of our existing borrowing capacity and additional borrowing capacity that we expect to put in place before October 2006. Over the long term, we manage our cash and capital structure to maximize shareholder return, strengthen our financial position and maintain flexibility for future strategic initiatives. We continuously assess our debt and leverage levels, capital expenditure requirements, principal debt payments, dividend payouts, potential share repurchases, and future investments or acquisitions. We believe our operating cash flows, existing cash and available credit facilities, as well as any potential future borrowing facilities will be sufficient to fund these scheduled future payments and potential long term initiatives. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The following discussion highlights the policies we feel are critical. Off Balance Sheet Financing Our co branded Nordstrom VISA credit card receivables are transferred to a third party trust on a daily basis. The balance of the receivables transferred to the trust fluctuates as new receivables are generated and old receivables are retired (through payments received, charge offs, or credits from merchandise returns). The trust issues securities that are backed by the receivables. Certain of these securities or beneficial interests are sold to third party investors and those remaining securities are issued to us. We recognize gains or losses on the sale of the co branded Nordstrom VISA receivables to the trust based on the difference between the face value of the receivables sold and the estimated fair value of the assets created in the securitization process. The fair value of the assets is calculated as the present value of their expected cash flows. The discount rate used to calculate fair value represents the volatility and risk of the assets. Assumptions and judgments are made to estimate the fair value of our investment in asset backed securities. We have no other off balance sheet transactions. Inventory Our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method (first in, first out basis). Under the retail method, the valuation of inventories and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of ending inventory. To determine if the retail value of our inventory should be marked down, we considered current and anticipated demand, customer preferences, age of the merchandise and fashion trends. As our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. We also reserve for obsolescence based on historical trends and specific identification. Shrinkage is estimated as a percentage of net sales for the period from the most recent semi annual inventory count based on historical shrinkage results. 22 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition We recognize revenues net of estimated returns and we exclude sales taxes. Our retail stores record revenue at the point of sale. Our catalog and Internet sales include shipping revenue and are recorded upon estimated delivery to the customer. As part of the normal sales cycle, we receive customer merchandise returns. To recognize the financial impact of sales returns, we estimate the amount of goods that will be returned and reduce sales and cost of sales accordingly. We utilize historical return patterns, which have remained consistent year over year, to estimate our expected returns. Vendor Allowances We receive allowances from merchandise vendors for purchase price adjustments, cooperative advertising programs, cosmetic selling expenses and vendor sponsored contests. Purchase price adjustments are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales after an agreement with the vendor is executed and the related merchandise has been sold. Allowances for cooperative advertising programs and vendor sponsored contests are recorded in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses as a reduction to the related cost when incurred. Allowances for cosmetic selling expenses are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses as a reduction to the related cost when incurred. Any allowances in excess of actual costs incurred that are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales. Self Insurance We retain a portion of the risk for certain losses related to health and welfare, workers compensation and general liability claims. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both losses reported and losses incurred but not yet reported. We estimate our ultimate cost based on internal analysis of historical data and independent actuarial estimates. We experienced an increase in our California workers compensation costs in 2002 and 2003 and declining costs in 2005. Our total workers compensation costs over the last three years have been $12,804, $29,263, and $33,782 in 2005, 2004, and 2003. Allowance For Doubtful Accounts Our allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of the losses inherent in our private label credit card receivable as of the balance sheet date. We evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on several factors, including historical trends of aging of accounts, write off experience and expectations of future performance. We recognize finance charges on delinquent accounts until the account is written off. Delinquent accounts are written off when they are determined to be uncollectible, usually after the passage of 151 days without receiving a full scheduled monthly payment. Accounts are written off sooner in the event of customer bankruptcy or other circumstances that make further collection unlikely. Our write off experience and aging trends have improved each of the last three years. Intangible Asset Impairment Testing We review our goodwill and acquired tradename annually for impairment in the first quarter or when circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. The goodwill and acquired tradename associated with our Faonnable business are our largest impairment risk. In 2005, we engaged an independent valuation specialist to estimate the reporting units fair value. Leases We lease the land or the land and building at many of our Full Line stores, and we lease the building at many of our Rack stores. Additionally, we lease office facilities, warehouses and equipment. We recognize lease expense on a straight line basis over the minimum lease term. In 2004, we corrected our lease accounting policy to recognize lease expense, net of property incentives, from the time that we control the leased property. We recorded a charge of $7.8 million ($4.7 million net of tax) in the fourth quarter of 2004 to correct this accounting policy. The impact of this change was immaterial to prior periods. Many of our leases include options that allow us to extend the lease term beyond the initial commitment period, subject to terms agreed to at lease inception. For leases that contain rent holiday periods and scheduled rent increases, we record the difference between the rent expense and the rental amount payable under the leases in liabilities. Some leases require additional payments based on sales and are recorded in rent expense when the contingent rent is probable. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS No. 151 amends ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material should be recognized as current period charges. In addition, this statement requires that fixed overhead production be allocated to the costs of conversion based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No. 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005, and should be applied prospectively. We do not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 151 will have a material impact on our financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment. SFAS No. 123R requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award. That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award. We expect to adopt SFAS No. 123R in the first quarter of 2006 under the modified prospective method. We believe adoption of SFAS No. 123R will reduce our 2006 diluted earnings per share by $0.06. Nordstrom, Inc. and subsidiaries 23 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. INTEREST RATE RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates. In seeking to minimize risk, we manage exposure through our regular operating and financing activities. We do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and are not party to any leveraged financial instruments. Interest rate exposure is managed through our mix of fixed and variable rate borrowings. Short term borrowing and investing activities generally bear interest at variable rates, but because they have maturities of three months or less, we believe that the risk of material loss was low, and that the carrying amount approximated fair value. The table below presents information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, which consist of debt obligations and interest rate swaps for the year ended January 28, 2006. For debt obligations, the table presents principal amounts, at book value, by maturity date, and related weighted average interest rates. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected (contractual) maturity dates. Notional amounts are the predetermined dollar principal on which the exchanged interest payments are based. Total at Fair value at January 28, January 28, Dollars in thousands 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter 2006 2006 Long term debt Fixed $306,618 $6,709 $256,858 $6,958 $5,419 $362,882 $945,444 $963,092 Avg. int. rate 4.9% 8.1% 5.7% 7.8% 8.9% 7.2% 6.0% Interest rate swap Fixed to variable $250,000 $250,000 $(11,050) Avg. pay rate 7.09% 7.09% Avg. receive rate 5.63% 5.63% FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK The majority of our revenue, expense and capital expenditures are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, we periodically enter into foreign currency purchase orders denominated in Euros for apparel, accessories and shoes. We use forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices. The fair value of our outstanding forward contracts at January 28, 2006 was not material. In addition, the functional currency of Faonnable, S.A.S. of Nice, France is the Euro. Assets and liabilities of Faonnable are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing at the end of the period. Income and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars at an average exchange rate during the period. Foreign currency gains and losses from the translation of Faonnables balance sheet and income statement are included in other comprehensive earnings. Foreign currency gains or losses from certain intercompany loans are recorded in other income including finance charges, net. We considered the potential impact of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates and we believe that such a change would not have a material impact on our cash flows of financial instruments that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange risk. The model measured the change in cash flows arising from the 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates, and covered long term debt denominated in Euros. 24 Table of Contents

STRATEGIC INITIATIVES FOR 2006 Our long term goal is to deliver industry leading performance, and we continue to focus on driving top line growth, gaining operational efficiencies and developing leaders for future growth. This mindset has served us well over the last few years as we have generated same store sales growth and improved our gross profit and selling, general, and administrative rates. Our 2006 initiatives maintain the same focus but also recognize the developments in our business and the marketplace. Drive Top Line Growth Our top priority is to gain market share through existing stores and channels, as well as from new Full Line stores. Our success in accomplishing this goal starts and ends with the experience each customer has in our stores. We believe the essence of this experience is desirable products coupled with personalized service. Our ongoing focus revolves around these two key elements of our business as we believe they are an integral part of long term success. For 2006, we have identified three specific areas of focus to drive top line growth: re energizing womens apparel, multi channel integration and enhancing our designer business. Womens Apparel Womens apparel represents about one third of our total sales and serves a wide range of individual tastes and styles. In 2005, we started to develop more targeted merchandising strategies for our womens departments. A thorough analysis of objective customer information combined with the feedback from our selling floor has helped us to better understand our customers needs and shopping priorities in terms of style, price, fit and occasion. We have carefully reorganized our merchant teams and are in the process of fine tuning our offerings to better serve our customers. Multi Channel Integration Our goal is to create a more integrated, consistent merchandise offering for our customers, whether they choose to shop in our Full Line stores, on the Internet or through our catalogs. As described in Multi Channel Strategy Execution on page 6, we initiated the integration in 2005. In 2006 we will begin migrating the Direct inventory system onto our Full Line store platform, creating a one company view of inventory resulting in a more seamless merchandise offering and experience for our customer. This process is expected to continue through 2008. Designer Our womens designer category has been a strong performer and contributes significantly to the aspirational nature of our brand. Our goal is to have a complete designer offering in at least one store for every major market we serve. In addition, we are focused on enhancing and aligning our designer offering across all major merchandise categories. In August 2005, we purchased a majority interest in Jeffrey, a luxury specialty store business with stores in New York City and Atlanta, and named the founder, President and CEO of Jeffrey, Mr. Jeffrey Kalinsky, Director of Designer Merchandising at Nordstrom. Along with our merchant team, were utilizing Mr. Kalinskys expertise and creativity in the designer business to further our current designer strategies. Additionally, we launched a designer Web site in February 2006, which offers designer apparel, footwear and accessories. Continue to Gain Operational Efficiencies As we drive top line growth, we seek to expand our gross profit and reduce our selling, general and administrative rates by minimizing the increases to our buying, occupancy, general and administrative costs. This approach has been successful over the past three years, as we have controlled these costs while we supported our same store sales growth. We are committed to keeping our technology investments current and relevant to our business needs. This includes investing in ongoing maintenance and system enhancements as well as replacing older applications as the opportunities present themselves. This is an ongoing part of our overall technology investment strategy. We anticipate additional rate improvement from our buying and corporate organization as we enhance our processes and expand the use of our systems to support our future sales growth. Leadership Development and Succession Planning At Nordstrom, we are committed to developing the best talent in retail. The training and development of our future leaders is critical to our long term growth. To that end, we have identified potential successors for all major leadership roles. We have also piloted with 35 executives a leadership development program designed to increase specifically identified leadership skills. This program includes identifying each leaders development needs and includes personal coaching as well as interactive group learning. This program will be rolled out to approximately 90 leaders by the end of 2006 with plans to train more individuals over the next few years. 14 Table of Contents OVERVIEW In 2005, our same store sales increased 6.0% on top of our 8.5% increase in 2004. These increases are our two highest annual same store sales growth results in the past 10 years. Some other retailers who combine an offering of compelling merchandise and customer service have also experienced positive sales growth. Our merchandise and selling costs increased in line with our same store sales, but our other costs, including buying and occupancy costs and non selling labor, remained relatively consistent with last year. As a result of our same store sales growth and expense performance, we experienced a significant increase in our operating income. Our earnings before income tax expense as a percentage of net sales was 11.5% in 2005, the first year that it exceeded 10.0% since we first issued stock to the public in 1971. In addition, our diluted earnings per share increased 43.5% to $1.98. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales (Dollars in Millions) Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Net sales $7,722.9 $7,131.4 $6,448.7 Net sales increase 8.3% 10.6% 8.5% Same store sales increase 6.0% 8.5% 4.1% Percentage of net sales by merchandise category: Womens apparel 35% 36% 36% Shoes 21% 20% 20% Cosmetics and womens accessories 20% 20% 19% Mens apparel 18% 18% 17% Childrens apparel 3% 3% 4% Other 3% 3% 4% 2005 VS 2004 NET SALES In our Full Line stores, our accessories, cosmetics and mens apparel merchandise categories experienced the largest same store sales increases. Our shoe divisions had same store sales increases. Our womens apparel merchandise category had mixed same store sales performance; womens intimate, junior and contemporary apparel were the leaders in the womens category, while womens special sizes, better and bridge apparel had same store sales decreases in 2005. Our Rack same store sales increased 14.8% in 2005, on top of last years 13.2% increase. Our sales increase was driven by the Racks merchandise mix, especially our ability to offer customers branded merchandise. Nordstrom Directs 2005 sales, including shipping revenue, decreased by 2.5%. Internet sales increased 40.7%. In February 2005, we reduced our shipping fees, which drove additional Internet sales but reduced our overall shipping revenue. Nordstrom Directs 2005 sales, excluding shipping revenue, improved by 2.4% compared to 2004. As part of the multi channel strategy (see page 6), we reduced our Direct catalog mailings significantly beginning in July 2005 and we shifted the merchandise offering to be more aligned with the Full Line stores. The decrease in the number of Direct catalog mailings, along with a continuing shift of catalog customers to the Internet, resulted in a drop in catalog sales in 2005. Total net sales increased as a result of our same store sales increases as well as from the six Full Line stores opened since February 2004. 2004 VS 2003 NET SALES Our net sales increased as our customers responded positively to our merchandise offerings. Both our Full Line and Rack stores had overall and same store sales increases. All of our geographic regions and major merchandise categories also reported overall and same store sales increases. The strongest performing areas were accessories, womens shoes and womens better apparel, followed by womens designer and mens apparel. Total net sales also benefited from the six Full Line stores and two Rack stores opened since February 2003, increasing our retail square footage 5% during the last two years. Sales at Nordstrom Direct increased 30.9% due to Internet customer order growth and an improved customer order fulfillment rate. Internet sales increased 53.1% due to an increase in the rate of Web site visits that result in sales and increased Internet advertising. Catalog net sales decreased in 2004 by 3%, which is consistent with our strategy to shift catalog customers to the Internet. 2006 FORECAST OF SAME STORE SALES In March 2006, we opened one Full Line store; later in 2006, we plan to open one Rack store and relocate one existing Full Line store, increasing retail square footage by approximately 1%. We expect 2006 same store sales to increase 1% to 3%. Nordstrom, Inc. and subsidiaries 15 Table of Contents Gross Profit (Dollars in Millions Except Per Square Foot Amounts) Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Gross profit $2,834.8 $2,572.0 $2,233.1 Gross profit rate 36.7% 36.1% 34.6% Average inventory per square foot $51.25 $52.46 $54.81 Inventory turnover 4.84 4.51 4.10 2005 VS 2004 GROSS PROFIT While we showed growth in our same store sales, we held buying and occupancy costs relatively consistent with last year. In addition, our merchandise costs increased in line with our sales increases. As a result, we drove a gross profit rate improvement of 60 basis points. We continue our efforts to improve inventory management while providing fresh and compelling merchandise to our customers. We utilized existing and new technology to gain greater visibility into our sales trends and inventory position. Our merchant teams used these tools to expand their analysis of our sales and on hand content to drive sales growth and increase our inventory turnover rate. 2004 VS 2003 GROSS PROFIT In 2004, the improvement in our gross profit rate was primarily a result of meeting our customers desire for fresh, compelling merchandise, which increased the sales of regular priced merchandise. In addition, gross profit benefited from our ongoing improvement in managing inventory and by holding buying costs and the fixed portion of occupancy expenses flat. Contributing to our gross profit rate improvement was the continuous improvement we are making utilizing our perpetual inventory system investment, which we made in 2003. We have better visibility into sales trends and on hand content, allowing us to more effectively manage our merchandise; the result was a significant improvement in our inventory turnover rate. Increased sell through of regular priced merchandise reduced the markdowns necessary to sell slow moving goods. We maintained our inventory at levels consistent with the prior year, even though our sales and square footage grew in 2004. The overall improvements in merchandise management have generated higher margins on our inventory investments. 2006 FORECAST OF GROSS PROFIT In 2006, if we achieve our planned same store sales growth, we expect a net 10 to 20 basis point improvement in our gross profit rate from continued sales leverage on buying and occupancy costs. This includes an estimated 15 basis point decrease to our 2006 gross profit rate when we adopt SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (Dollars in Millions) Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Selling, general and administrative expenses $2,100.7 $2,020.2 $1,899.1 Selling, general and administrative rate 27.2% 28.3% 29.4% 2005 VS 2004 SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES The primary component of our selling, general and administrative expenses that varies with our same store sales is our selling costs. Most of our other expenses do not fluctuate with changes in our same store sales. In 2005, as our same store sales increased 6.0%, we held our general and administrative expenses essentially in line with 2004, which resulted in a 110 basis point decrease in our selling, general and administrative rate. This is our second year in a row that the combination of our net sales increases and control of our general and administrative costs has given us an improvement in the selling, general and administrative rate of over 100 basis points. 2004 VS 2003 SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES We continued to use our infrastructure to support increased sales. In 2004, our selling, general and administrative rate improved 110 basis points. We were able to control and leverage our fixed general and administrative expenses, especially non selling labor. While selling expense increased in 2004, primarily from higher costs linked to increased sales, we experienced a slight rate improvement in selling expense as a percentage of net sales. 2006 FORECAST OF SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES In 2006, our selling, general and administrative rate is expected to improve overall by 10 to 20 basis points, primarily from continued sales leverage on general and administrative expenses. This includes an estimated 20 basis point increase to our 2006 selling, general and administrative rate when we adopt SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. 16 Table of Contents Interest Expense, Net (Dollars in Millions) Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Interest expense, net $45.3 $77.4 $91.0 2005 VS 2004 INTEREST EXPENSE, NET Interest expense, net decreased $32.1 million in 2005 compared to 2004. The decrease is primarily due to debt prepayment costs of $20.9 million incurred in 2004 in connection with a $198.2 million debt buyback. We did not incur similar costs in 2005. 2004 VS 2003 INTEREST EXPENSE, NET We prepaid debt of $198.2 million in 2004 and $105.7 million in 2003. We incurred debt prepayment costs of $20.9 million in 2004 and $14.3 million in 2003. The decrease in our interest expense, net in 2004 was due to the reduction in our 2004 average outstanding debt, partially offset by the increase in the prepayment costs. 2006 FORECAST OF INTEREST EXPENSE, NET We expect a reduction in interest expense, net of approximately $8 to $10 million due to higher interest income. This forecasted interest expense can vary based upon the rate of our share repurchases, which affects our cash on hand and the related interest income, and the variable portion of our long term debt. Although the majority of our debt has fixed interest rates, we currently hold an interest rate swap agreement on our $250.0 million 5.625% senior notes due in January 2009, where we receive a fixed rate of 5.625% and pay a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a margin of 2.3% set at six month intervals (7.09% at January 28, 2006). Other Income Including Finance Charges, Net (Dollars in Millions) Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Other income including finance charges, net $196.4 $172.9 $155.1 Other income including finance charges, net as a percentage of net sales 2.5% 2.4% 2.4% 2005 VS 2004 OTHER INCOME INCLUDING FINANCE CHARGES, NET Other income including finance charges, net increased $23.4 million, due to earnings growth in the Nordstrom fsb co branded VISA credit card program and our gift card breakage income of $8.0 million. The principal balances of receivables in the VISA credit card, which are held by a separate trust in which we hold a certificated interest, increased 20.6% during 2005. The receivables growth increase, which is mostly funded by our operating cash flows, produces an increase in the trusts earnings. Our income from the program increased primarily because of this growth in the co branded receivables program. Gift card breakage income is a new component of income in 2005. Unclaimed property legislation changed in 2004 to allow us to retain unused balances on gift cards. We analyzed the experience of our program since it was introduced in 1999, and we determined that balances remaining on cards issued five years ago are unlikely to be redeemed. The breakage income recognized in 2005 includes $2.6 million and $5.4 million for cards issued in 1999 and 2000; in both cases, the breakage income is 3.4% of the amount issued as gift cards in those years. 2004 VS 2003 OTHER INCOME INCLUDING FINANCE CHARGES, NET Our overall other income including finance charges, net increased $17.9 million, primarily from our co branded VISA credit card program growth. Since 2002, we marketed this credit card to our in store customers and the inactive Nordstrom private label credit card holders. These marketing efforts showed success in 2004, as the co branded VISA credit card holders used the cards more extensively in 2004, resulting in a 45.7% volume increase. 2006 FORECAST OF OTHER INCOME INCLUDING FINANCE CHARGES, NET In 2006, other income including finance charges, net is expected to increase approximately $25 to $30 million as we continue to see growth in our VISA credit card program and corresponding income. Nordstrom, Inc. and subsidiaries 17 Table of Contents Income Tax Expense (Dollars in Millions) Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Income tax expense $333.9 $253.8 $155.3 Effective tax rate 37.7% 39.2% 39.0% 2005 VS 2004 INCOME TAX EXPENSE Our expected effective tax rate, considering the federal tax rate of 35.0% and the net effect of state income taxes, is 38.5%. In 2005, our actual effective tax rate was below this rate because our 2004 tax expense, which was finalized in the third quarter of 2005, was less than we expected; we reduced our reserve when the audits of our 2000 and 2001 federal tax returns were completed; and, we utilized a larger than previously estimated amount of our capital loss carryforward. 2004 VS 2003 INCOME TAX EXPENSE Our effective tax rate in 2004 increased from the 2003 rate because we recorded a valuation allowance for a portion of a capital loss carryforward which we deemed to be unrealizable. 2006 FORECAST OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE In 2006, we expect our effective tax rate to be 38.5%. Net Earnings and Diluted Earnings Per Share (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Net earnings $551.3 $393.5 $242.8 Net earnings as a percentage of net sales 7.1% 5.5% 3.8% Diluted earnings per share $1.98 $1.38 $0.88 2005 VS 2004 NET EARNINGS AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE In 2005, net earnings increased 40.1% and diluted earnings per share increased 43.5% as a result of our same store sales growth and sales leverage on buying and occupancy and general and administrative expenses. In 2004, we incurred prepayment costs and wrote off deferred debt costs totaling $20.9 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, upon prepayment of $198.2 million of long term debt. We did not incur similar costs in 2005. 2004 VS 2003 NET EARNINGS AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE In 2004, earnings per share increased to $1.38 from $0.88 in 2003. This increase was driven by a strong increase in overall and same store sales, improvements in gross profit through better inventory management, and sales leverage on buying and occupancy and selling, general and administrative expenses. 2006 FORECAST OF DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE We expect our diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.15 to $2.23 in 2006, which includes an estimated annual expense of $0.06 per diluted share from the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment in the first quarter of 2006. Fourth Quarter Results Net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2005 were $190.4 million compared with $140.0 million in 2004. Total sales for the quarter increased 9.3% to $2.3 billion and same store sales increased by 5.8%. Our cosmetics, accessories and mens apparel merchandise categories experienced the largest same store sales increases. Our shoe divisions had same store sales increases. Our womens apparel merchandise categories had mixed same store sales performance. Womens intimate and contemporary apparel were the leaders in the womens category, while womens special sizes, bridge and better apparel had same store sales decreases in 2005. Our gross profit rate increased to 37.5% from 36.6% last year. Our womens apparel category experienced a reduction in gross profit rate, but this was offset by improvement in the mens apparel and accessories categories. The quarterly improvement in our gross profit rate resulted from leverage on our buying and occupancy expenses. Our selling, general and administrative rate improved 70 basis points from 26.9% to 26.2%, primarily from leverage on our general and administrative expenses. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overall, cash increased by $102.0 million to $462.7 million as of January 28, 2006 due primarily to the increase in our net earnings in 2005. We utilized our cash flow from operations for capital expenditures, to repay debt and to return capital to our shareholders through dividends and repurchases of our common stock. 18 Table of Contents Operating Activities 2005 VS 2004 OPERATING ACTIVITIES Net cash flow from operating activities increased from $606.3 million to $776.2 million, an increase of $169.9 million primarily due to the growth in our net earnings. We continue to see growth in our co branded VISA credit card program, and as a result we have increased the capital we allocate to fund this program. Under our co branded VISA program, we earn interchange and finance charge income and we offer card holders merchandise certificates, which can be redeemed in our stores, similar to a gift certificate. Our operating cash flows have been sufficient over the past three years to support the annual growth of this program, and we expect additional growth in 2006 also will be funded from our operations. A key tool that we use to manage our inventory is our perpetual inventory system. In 2005, we reduced our average inventory per square foot by 2.3%. We use our perpetual inventory system to identify sales trends quickly, so we can enhance additional sales opportunities and increase inventory turnover. In the course of negotiating for store locations, some developers offer up front cash payments to defray our capital expenditures in exchange for our commitment to operate a store in their development. In 2005, we received $49.5 million of these incentives, which is a $29.6 million increase over 2004. Property incentive receipts vary year to year, depending on the number of our store openings and remodels and the arrangements we negotiate with developers. 2004 VS 2003 OPERATING ACTIVITIES In 2004, net cash flow from operating activities increased to $606.3 million, a $7.1 million increase. Higher net earnings was offset by our merchandise purchase and payment flow changes in 2004 as compared to 2003 and the timing of income tax payments. Toward the end of 2003 and into 2004, we achieved a more even flow of merchandise purchases in relation to our sales trends. Our 2004 inventory turns have improved over the prior year; the payables leverage we achieved in 2004 is consistent with our merchandise purchase plan. Income tax payments have increased in 2004 as a result of our earnings growth. 2006 FORECAST FOR OPERATING ACTIVITIES In 2006, cash flows provided by operating activities are expected to increase slightly as a result of increased net earnings. Investing Activities In the past three years, we have had two principal types of investing activities: capital expenditures and short term investments. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES The changes in the level of our capital expenditures from year to year partially correlate to the number of stores opened in each year: Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Capital expenditures (in millions) $271.7 $246.9 $258.3 Stores opened: Full Line 4 2 4 Rack 2 In 2005, we opened four Full Line stores: at Phipps Plaza in Atlanta, Georgia; at The Shops at La Cantera in San Antonio, Texas; at the Irvine Spectrum Center in Irvine, California; and at the NorthPark Center in Dallas, Texas. Gross square footage for the year increased approximately 3.5%, from 19,397,000 to 20,070,000. In 2005, 40% of our capital expenditures was for new stores and 30% was for remodels. In addition, 15% of our capital expenditures was for information technology and 15% for other routine projects. Our capital expenditures over the last three years totaled $776.8 million. These capital expenditures were offset by property incentives of $115.3 million. With these capital expenditures, we added stores, enhanced existing facilities and improved our information systems. More than 1.6 million square feet of retail store space have been added during this period, representing an increase of 9% since January 31, 2003. We expect that our capital expenditures will be $1.5 billion over the next three years, with $319 million planned for 2006. These future capital expenditures are expected to be offset partially by property incentives of $230 million. We plan to use 50% of this investment to build new stores, 25% on remodels, 10% on information technology and 15% for smaller, store related improvements. Compared to the previous three years, capital expenditures will increase 94%, with increased spending allocated to new stores. The estimated capital project spending does not include potential investments in new stores resulting from the current industry consolidation. We believe we have the capacity to address additional capital investments should opportunities arise. As of January 28, 2006, we were contractually committed to spend $567.5 million for constructing new stores, remodeling existing stores, and other capital projects. Nordstrom, Inc. and subsidiaries 19 Table of Contents SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS We reduced our holdings of our short term investments in 2004 when we repurchased $198.2 million of long term debt. In 2005, our short term investment balances have been more consistent. We evaluate a number of short term investment options, with a variety of yields and liquidity restrictions. Consistent with our investment policy, we invest our excess cash in high quality short term investments. Some of these investments are classified as cash equivalents while others are classified as short term investments; changes in the investment mix, while not significant to our overall short term investing activities, can impact our net cash flows from investing activities. Financing Activities Over the past three years, our net operating cash flows have exceeded our net investing activities, and we used this excess cash flow to repay long term debt, pay dividends, and to repurchase our common stock in 2004 and 2005. Over this three year period, the price of our common stock has increased, which spurred stock option exercises that also increased our net cash. We have not utilized our short term borrowing facilities during the past three years. DEBT REPURCHASE The following table outlines our debt retirement activity (in millions): Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Principal repaid or retired: Senior notes, 8.95%, due 2005 $196.8 $103.2 Notes payable, 6.7%, due 2005 $96.0 $1.5 $2.5 Total $96.0 $198.3 $105.7 Total cash payment $96.0 $220.1 $120.8 We repaid the remaining $96.0 million of our 6.7% medium term notes when they matured in 2005. The cash payments in 2004 and 2003 that exceeded the principal retired represent early prepayment premiums. In October 2006, our $300.0 million 4.82% Private Label Securitization will mature. We intend to borrow the funds necessary to repay the Securitization with a combination of our existing borrowing capacity and additional borrowing capacity that we expect to put in place before October 2006. In the first quarter of 2007, we intend to establish a new securitization program that includes the private label and co branded Visa cards. SHARE REPURCHASE In August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized $300.0 million of share repurchases, replacing a previous share repurchase authorization. By the end of 2004, we purchased 13.8 million shares in the open market for the entire authorized amount of $300.0 million at an average price of $21.71 per share. In February 2005, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $500.0 million of share repurchases. The actual number and timing of share repurchases will be subject to market conditions and applicable SEC rules. We entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with Goldman, Sachs Co. in September 2005 to repurchase shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $100.0 million. We purchased 2.6 million shares of our common stock on September 8, 2005 at $38.77 per share. Under the terms of the agreement, we received 0.1 million additional shares in March 2006 based on the volume weighted average price of our common stock from September 8, 2005 to March 3, 2006. Overall for 2005, we purchased 8.5 million shares for $287.1 million at an average price of $33.80 per share. We expect to utilize the remaining authorization of $212.9 million in the first half of 2006. Debt to Capital Ratio Our recent favorable operating results increased our shareholders equity and allowed us to reduce our long term debt, which contributed to a decrease in our debt to capital ratio from 43.0% at the end of 2003 to 30.9% at the end of 2005. We believe that a debt to capital ratio in the range of 25% to 40% results in favorable debt ratings and provides appropriate flexibility and a reasonable cost of capital. Off Balance Sheet Financing We transfer our Nordstrom co branded VISA credit card receivables to a third party trust that issued $200 million of VISA receivable backed securities to third parties in 2002; those securities mature in April 2007. The outstanding balance of the co branded VISA credit card receivables exceeds the receivable backed securities balance. As a result, we hold securities that represent our beneficial interests in the trust, recorded as investment in asset backed securities in our consolidated balance sheets. We do not record the $200.0 million of VISA receivable backed securities or the co branded Nordstrom VISA credit card receivables transferred to the trust on our consolidated balance sheets. In the past, this off balance sheet financing provided us a cost effective source of capital. See Note 8 for a further description of our off balance sheet financing activities, including the amounts of income and cash flows arising from the arrangement and the amounts of our beneficial interests. 20 Table of Contents Interest Rate Swaps To manage our interest rate risk, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in 2003, which had a $250.0 million notional amount expiring in January 2009. Under the agreement, we receive a fixed rate of 5.63% and pay a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a margin of 2.3% set at six month intervals (7.09% at January 28, 2006). The interest rate swap agreement had a fair value of $(11.1) million and $(7.8) million at the end of 2005 and 2004. Contractual Obligations (Dollars in Millions) The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and the expected effect on our liquidity and cash flows. We expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business and credit available to us under existing and potential future facilities. Less than More than Total 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years 5 years Long term debt $1,136.1 $305.8 $461.5 $11.0 $357.8 Capital lease obligations 15.5 2.0 3.9 2.6 7.0 Operating leases 680.6 73.4 143.8 131.4 332.0 Purchase obligations 1,469.9 996.6 379.0 71.2 23.1 Other long term liabilities 196.9 30.0 39.9 19.2 107.8 Total $3,499.0 $1,407.8 $1,028.1 $235.4 $827.7 Long term debt includes financing related to the $200.0 million off balance sheet receivable backed securities due in April 2007. In addition to the required debt repayments disclosed above, we estimate total interest payments of approximately $576.6 million as of January 28, 2006, payable over the remaining life of the debts. Purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for unreceived goods or services and capital expenditure commitments. Other long term liabilities consist of workers compensation and general liability insurance reserves and postretirement benefits. The repayment amounts presented above were determined based on historical payment trends. Other long term liabilities not requiring cash payments, such as deferred property incentives, were excluded from the table above. This table also excludes the short term liabilities, other than the current portion of long term debt, disclosed on our 2005 balance sheet as the amounts recorded for these items will be paid in the next year. Credit Capacity and Commitments The following table summarizes our amount of commitment expiration per period (in millions): Total Amounts Less than More than Committed 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years 5 years Other commercial commitments $500.0 unsecured line of credit, none outstanding $150.0 variable funding note, none outstanding Standby letters of credit $11.2 $11.2 Import letters of credit $19.5 $19.5 Total $30.7 $30.7 In November 2005, we replaced our existing $350.0 million unsecured line of credit with a $500.0 million unsecured line of credit, which is available as liquidity support for our commercial paper program. Under the terms of the agreement, we pay a variable rate of interest and a commitment fee based on our debt rating. Based upon our current debt rating, we pay a variable rate of interest of LIBOR plus a margin of 0.225% (4.793% at January 28, 2006) on the outstanding balance and an annual commitment fee of 0.075% on the total capacity. The variable rate of interest increases to LIBOR plus a margin of 0.325% if more than $250.0 million is outstanding on the facility. The line of credit expires in November 2010, and contains restrictive covenants, which include maintaining a leverage ratio. We have a variable funding note backed by Nordstrom private label card and VISA credit card receivables with a borrowing capacity of $150.0 million. The annual renewal of this note requires both our approval and our issuing banks approval and interest is paid based on the actual cost of commercial paper plus specified fees of 0.15% (4.66% as of January 28, 2006). We also pay a commitment fee of 0.15% for the note based on the amount of the commitment. The facility can be cancelled or not renewed if our debt ratings fall below Standard and Poors BB rating or Moodys Ba1 rating. We did not make any borrowings under our unsecured line of credit or our variable funding note backed by Nordstrom private label card receivables during the three years ended January 28, 2006. We also have universal shelf registrations on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to offer an additional $450.0 million of securities to the public. These registration statements allow us to issue various types of securities, including debt, common stock, warrants to purchase common stock, warrants to purchase debt securities and warrants to purchase or sell foreign currency. Nordstrom, Inc. and subsidiaries 21 Table of Contents Debt Ratings The following table shows our credit ratings at the date of this report: Standard Credit Ratings Moodys and Poors Senior unsecured debt Baa1 A Commercial paper P 2 A 2 Outlook Stable Positive watch These ratings could change depending on our performance and other factors. Our outstanding debt is not subject to termination or interest rate adjustments based on changes in our credit ratings. Dividends In 2005, we paid dividends of $0.32 per share, the ninth consecutive year that our annual dividends increased. We paid dividends of $0.24 and $0.205 in 2004 and 2003. In determining the amount of dividends to pay, we analyze our dividend payout ratio and our dividend yield and balance the dividend payment with our operating performance and capital resources. We target a dividend payout ratio of approximately 18% to 20% of net income, although the ratio has been slightly lower the last two years as a result of the significant increase in our net earnings. For the dividend yield, which is calculated as our dividends per share divided by our stock price, we target a 1% long term yield. While we plan to increase dividends over time, we will balance future increases with our operating performance and available capital resources. Liquidity We maintain a level of liquidity to allow us to cover our seasonal cash needs and to minimize our need for short term borrowings. We believe that our operating cash flows, existing cash and available credit facilities are sufficient to finance our cash requirements for the next 12 months. In October 2006, we plan to repay our $300.0 million 4.82% Private Label Securitization with proceeds from a combination of our existing borrowing capacity and additional borrowing capacity that we expect to put in place before October 2006. Over the long term, we manage our cash and capital structure to maximize shareholder return, strengthen our financial position and maintain flexibility for future strategic initiatives. We continuously assess our debt and leverage levels, capital expenditure requirements, principal debt payments, dividend payouts, potential share repurchases, and future investments or acquisitions. We believe our operating cash flows, existing cash and available credit facilities, as well as any potential future borrowing facilities will be sufficient to fund these scheduled future payments and potential long term initiatives. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The following discussion highlights the policies we feel are critical. Off Balance Sheet Financing Our co branded Nordstrom VISA credit card receivables are transferred to a third party trust on a daily basis. The balance of the receivables transferred to the trust fluctuates as new receivables are generated and old receivables are retired (through payments received, charge offs, or credits from merchandise returns). The trust issues securities that are backed by the receivables. Certain of these securities or beneficial interests are sold to third party investors and those remaining securities are issued to us. We recognize gains or losses on the sale of the co branded Nordstrom VISA receivables to the trust based on the difference between the face value of the receivables sold and the estimated fair value of the assets created in the securitization process. The fair value of the assets is calculated as the present value of their expected cash flows. The discount rate used to calculate fair value represents the volatility and risk of the assets. Assumptions and judgments are made to estimate the fair value of our investment in asset backed securities. We have no other off balance sheet transactions. Inventory Our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method (first in, first out basis). Under the retail method, the valuation of inventories and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of ending inventory. To determine if the retail value of our inventory should be marked down, we considered current and anticipated demand, customer preferences, age of the merchandise and fashion trends. As our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. We also reserve for obsolescence based on historical trends and specific identification. Shrinkage is estimated as a percentage of net sales for the period from the most recent semi annual inventory count based on historical shrinkage results. 22 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition We recognize revenues net of estimated returns and we exclude sales taxes. Our retail stores record revenue at the point of sale. Our catalog and Internet sales include shipping revenue and are recorded upon estimated delivery to the customer. As part of the normal sales cycle, we receive customer merchandise returns. To recognize the financial impact of sales returns, we estimate the amount of goods that will be returned and reduce sales and cost of sales accordingly. We utilize historical return patterns, which have remained consistent year over year, to estimate our expected returns. Vendor Allowances We receive allowances from merchandise vendors for purchase price adjustments, cooperative advertising programs, cosmetic selling expenses and vendor sponsored contests. Purchase price adjustments are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales after an agreement with the vendor is executed and the related merchandise has been sold. Allowances for cooperative advertising programs and vendor sponsored contests are recorded in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses as a reduction to the related cost when incurred. Allowances for cosmetic selling expenses are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses as a reduction to the related cost when incurred. Any allowances in excess of actual costs incurred that are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales. Self Insurance We retain a portion of the risk for certain losses related to health and welfare, workers compensation and general liability claims. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both losses reported and losses incurred but not yet reported. We estimate our ultimate cost based on internal analysis of historical data and independent actuarial estimates. We experienced an increase in our California workers compensation costs in 2002 and 2003 and declining costs in 2005. Our total workers compensation costs over the last three years have been $12,804, $29,263, and $33,782 in 2005, 2004, and 2003. Allowance For Doubtful Accounts Our allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of the losses inherent in our private label credit card receivable as of the balance sheet date. We evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on several factors, including historical trends of aging of accounts, write off experience and expectations of future performance. We recognize finance charges on delinquent accounts until the account is written off. Delinquent accounts are written off when they are determined to be uncollectible, usually after the passage of 151 days without receiving a full scheduled monthly payment. Accounts are written off sooner in the event of customer bankruptcy or other circumstances that make further collection unlikely. Our write off experience and aging trends have improved each of the last three years. Intangible Asset Impairment Testing We review our goodwill and acquired tradename annually for impairment in the first quarter or when circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. The goodwill and acquired tradename associated with our Faonnable business are our largest impairment risk. In 2005, we engaged an independent valuation specialist to estimate the reporting units fair value. Leases We lease the land or the land and building at many of our Full Line stores, and we lease the building at many of our Rack stores. Additionally, we lease office facilities, warehouses and equipment. We recognize lease expense on a straight line basis over the minimum lease term. In 2004, we corrected our lease accounting policy to recognize lease expense, net of property incentives, from the time that we control the leased property. We recorded a charge of $7.8 million ($4.7 million net of tax) in the fourth quarter of 2004 to correct this accounting policy. The impact of this change was immaterial to prior periods. Many of our leases include options that allow us to extend the lease term beyond the initial commitment period, subject to terms agreed to at lease inception. For leases that contain rent holiday periods and scheduled rent increases, we record the difference between the rent expense and the rental amount payable under the leases in liabilities. Some leases require additional payments based on sales and are recorded in rent expense when the contingent rent is probable. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS No. 151 amends ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material should be recognized as current period charges. In addition, this statement requires that fixed overhead production be allocated to the costs of conversion based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No. 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005, and should be applied prospectively. We do not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 151 will have a material impact on our financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment. SFAS No. 123R requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award. That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award. We expect to adopt SFAS No. 123R in the first quarter of 2006 under the modified prospective method. We believe adoption of SFAS No. 123R will reduce our 2006 diluted earnings per share by $0.06. Nordstrom, Inc. and subsidiaries 23 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. INTEREST RATE RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates. In seeking to minimize risk, we manage exposure through our regular operating and financing activities. We do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and are not party to any leveraged financial instruments. Interest rate exposure is managed through our mix of fixed and variable rate borrowings. Short term borrowing and investing activities generally bear interest at variable rates, but because they have maturities of three months or less, we believe that the risk of material loss was low, and that the carrying amount approximated fair value. The table below presents information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, which consist of debt obligations and interest rate swaps for the year ended January 28, 2006. For debt obligations, the table presents principal amounts, at book value, by maturity date, and related weighted average interest rates. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected (contractual) maturity dates. Notional amounts are the predetermined dollar principal on which the exchanged interest payments are based.

However, we periodically enter into foreign currency purchase orders denominated in Euros for apparel, accessories and shoes. We use forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices. The fair value of our outstanding forward contracts at January 28, 2006 was not material. In addition, the functional currency of Faonnable, S.A.S. of Nice, France is the Euro. Assets and liabilities of Faonnable are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing at the end of the period. Income and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars at an average exchange rate during the period. Foreign currency gains and losses from the translation of Faonnables balance sheet and income statement are included in other comprehensive earnings. Foreign currency gains or losses from certain intercompany loans are recorded in other income including finance charges, net. We considered the potential impact of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates and we believe that such a change would not have a material impact on our cash flows of financial instruments that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange risk. The model measured the change in cash flows arising from the 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates, and covered long term debt denominated in Euros. 24 Table of Contents
