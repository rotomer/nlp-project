We purchased the outstanding shares of Nordstrom.com, Inc. series C preferred stock for $70,000. The minority interest purchase and reintegration costs resulted in a one time charge of $53,168. No tax benefit was recognized as there was no possibility of a future tax benefit. When we adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, our initial impairment test of the Faonnable Business Unit resulted in an impairment charge to acquired tradename of $16,133 and to goodwill of $5,767. The impairment charge is reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change ($13,359, net of tax). 5 In 2002, earnings before income tax expense and earnings before income tax expense as a percentage of net sales do not include the cumulative effect of an accounting change of $13,359, net of tax of $8,541. 12 Table of Contents (Dollars in thousands except sales per square foot and per share amounts) Fiscal Year 20004 19995 1998 1997 1996 Operations Net sales $5,511,908 $5,144,754 $5,049,182 $4,864,604 $4,457,931 Same store sales percentage increase (decrease)1 0.3% (1.1% ) (2.7% ) 4.0% 0.6% Gross profit 1,854,220 1,781,929 1,704,237 1,568,791 1,378,472 Gross profit rate2 33.6% 34.6% 33.8% 32.2% 30.9% Selling, general, and administrative expenses (1,722,247 ) (1,516,259 ) (1,429,837 ) (1,338,235 ) (1,232,860 ) Selling, general, and administrative rate3 31.2% 29.5% 28.3% 27.5% 27.7% Operating income 131,973 265,670 274,400 230,556 145,612 Interest expense, net (62,698 ) (50,396 ) (47,091 ) (34,250 ) (39,400 ) Other income including finance charges, net 130,600 116,783 110,414 110,907 135,331 Earnings before income tax expense 167,018 332,057 337,723 307,213 241,543 Earnings before income tax expense as a percentage of net sales 3.0% 6.5% 6.7% 6.3% 5.4% Net earnings 101,918 202,557 206,723 186,213 146,316 Net earnings as a percentage of net sales 1.8% 3.9% 4.1% 3.8% 3.3% Earnings per diluted share $0.39 $0.73 $0.70 $0.60 $0.45 Dividends per share $0.175 $0.16 $0.15 $0.1325 $0.125 Return on average shareholders equity 8.4% 16.3% 15.0% 12.8% 10.2% Sales per square foot $341 $349 $362 $384 $377 Financial Position (at year end) Customer accounts receivable, net $649,504 $557,190 $560,564 $621,704 $661,332 Investment in asset backed securities 50,183 38,830 7,097 20,158 31,791 Merchandise inventories 945,687 797,845 750,269 826,045 719,919 Current assets 1,812,982 1,564,648 1,668,689 1,613,492 1,549,819 Current liabilities 950,568 866,509 794,490 979,031 795,321 Land, buildings and equipment, net 1,599,938 1,429,492 1,378,006 1,252,513 1,152,454 Long term debt, including current portion 1,112,296 804,982 868,234 420,865 380,632 Shareholders equity 1,233,445 1,185,614 1,300,545 1,458,950 1,457,084 Debt to capital ratio 49.2% 42.5% 42.1% 31.9% 27.2% Book value per share 4.61 4.48 4.58 4.78 4.57 Total assets 3,608,503 3,062,081 3,103,689 2,890,664 2,726,495 Store Information (at year end) Full Line stores 77 71 67 65 62 Rack and other stores 43 33 30 27 21 International Faonnable boutiques 20 0 0 0 0 Total square footage 16,056,000 14,487,000 13,593,000 12,614,000 11,754,000 1 Same stores include stores that have been open at least one full year at the beginning of the year. 2 Gross profit rate is calculated as the gross profit as a percentage of net sales. 3 Selling, general, and administrative rate is calculated as the selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales. 4 2000 The items below amounted to a net $56,084 charge ($34,211, net of tax, or $0.13 per diluted share): Selling, general and administrative expenses included a charge of $13,000 for certain severance and other costs related to a change in management.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Nordstrom is a fashion specialty retailer offering high quality apparel, shoes, cosmetics and accessories for women, men and children. We offer a wide selection of brand name and private label merchandise. We offer our products through multiple retail channels including our Full Line Nordstrom stores, our discount Nordstrom Rack stores, our Faonnable boutiques, our catalogs and on the Internet at www.nordstrom.com. Our stores are located throughout the United States and we have 36 Faonnable boutiques located in France, Portugal, and Belgium. In addition, we offer our customers a variety of payment products and services including our loyalty program. STRATEGIC INITIATIVES We believe we are well positioned to grow the value of our business by executing our strategy through the following key initiatives: enhancing our merchandise offering within our existing product categories, improving the shopping experience for our customers across all channels, and continuing to increase our presence where our customers shop. Merchandise Strategies Weve found that theres a great deal of opportunity to grow our sales in existing stores simply by earning a greater share of our customers business across multiple product categories. Our new systems and merchandising disciplines have helped us begin to take advantage of opportunities for increased sales by enhancing our ability to keep inventories fresh and turn them more rapidly. Customers are responding favorably to newness across all merchandise categories, leading to meaningful gains in areas such as mens apparel, accessories, womens and kids shoes and cosmetics throughout 2006. A consistently strong performer in 2006 was our designer category, including apparel, shoes and accessories merchandise. We are continuing to expand our offering of designer merchandise. Multi Channel Shopping Experience Our future success continues to depend upon our ability to provide our customers with a superior and fully integrated shopping experience. As a multi channel retailer, we are uniquely positioned to respond to evolving customer needs and expectations. The necessary resources have been committed and critical projects are underway in this effort. We are installing a new inventory system, and we are expanding both our fulfillment and call centers in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Our online store is essential to creating relationships with many of our most active and loyal customers. Many customers who start shopping with us online migrate to our stores. By giving customers a more similar shopping experience in store and online, were making progress to become more relevant to todays shoppers. Increase Our Presence Given the industry consolidation impacting many of our competitors, we see potential to gain market share and grow our business by increasing our presence where our customers live. Fortunately, we are in an advantageous position to reach new customers through building stores and enhancing our current ones. Weve recently launched a $2.8 billion capital plan, with 80% of the dollars allocated to customer facing investments, primarily new stores, remodels and relocations. We will continue with a disciplined approach to real estate acquisitions, adding new stores when and where they pass our criteria. Our current strategy calls for a 4% to 5% increase in square footage growth through 2011 with 26 new or relocated stores announced through 2011. OVERVIEW For the first time in our history, our earnings before income tax expense exceeded $1 billion in 2006. This result was driven primarily by the combination of continued sales growth, gross profit rate expansion and leverage of selling, general and administrative expenses. Key highlights include: We achieved positive same store sales growth for the fifth year in a row. Same store sales increased 7.5% on top of our 6.0% increase in 2005 and our 8.5% increase in 2004. Our gross profit rate increased 75 basis points primarily due to merchandise margin expansion. With the sales growth mentioned above, we leveraged our overhead costs, resulting in a 37 basis point improvement in our selling, general and administrative expense rate. Full year earnings per diluted share increased 28.8% over last year to $2.55. Like many other retailers, Nordstrom follows the retail 4 5 4 reporting calendar, which included an extra week in fiscal 2006 (the 53rd week). The 53rd week is not included in same store sales calculations. 14 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales (Dollars in Millions) Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Net sales $8,560.7 $7,722.9 $7,131.4 Net sales increase 10.8% 8.3% 10.6% Same store sales increase 7.5% 6.0% 8.5% Percentage of net sales by merchandise category: Womens apparel 35% 35% 36% Shoes 20% 21% 20% Mens apparel 18% 18% 18% Cosmetics 11% 11% 11% Womens accessories 10% 9% 9% Childrens apparel 3% 3% 3% Other 3% 3% 3% 2006 VS 2005 NET SALES All of our Full Line store regions and most of our Full Line store merchandise categories had same store sales increases. Our Full Line stores had a 5.9% same store sales increase, ahead of last years result of 5.4%. Some other retailers who combine an offering of high end merchandise and customer service continued to experience positive sales growth in 2006. Our largest same store sales increases came from our accessories, cosmetics and mens apparel merchandise categories. Womens apparel experienced same store sales decreases in the first half of the year, but had same store sales increases in the second half, resulting in a low single digit increase for the full year. The designer category, which benefited from additional investment because it is an important component of our merchandise strategy, had a double digit same store sales increase. Our Rack same store sales increased 10.9% in 2006, on top of last years 14.8% increase. Rack purchases the majority of its merchandise from third parties and serves as a clearance channel for our Full Line stores. The sales growth came from all regions and merchandise categories. Our online store sales drove Nordstrom Directs 2006 total net sales increase of 23.0%. Our online sales benefited from the overall Internet marketplace expansion, driven by the continued adoption of higher speed Internet connections which allow for convenient and efficient shopping, as well as utilization of the Internet as a tool for research and information before making a purchase decision. Catalog sales experienced an overall decline because we reduced our catalog mailings beginning in the middle of 2005. Total net sales increased 10.8% as a result of our same store sales increases as well as from the five Full Line stores and one Rack store opened since February 2005. We also relocated one Full Line store and expanded one Rack store, which contributed to our increase in total net sales. In the 53rd week, we had sales of $117.7. Sales for the 53rd week represented 1.5% of the total percentage increase versus the prior year. 2005 VS 2004 NET SALES In our Full Line stores, our accessories, cosmetics and mens apparel merchandise categories experienced the largest same store sales increases. Our shoes division had same store sales increases. Our womens apparel merchandise category had mixed same store sales performance; womens intimate, junior and contemporary apparel were the leaders in the womens category, while womens special sizes, better and bridge apparel had same store sales decreases in 2005. Our Rack same store sales increased 14.8% in 2005, on top of an increase of 13.2% in 2004. Our sales increase was driven by the Racks merchandise mix, especially our ability to offer customers branded merchandise. Nordstrom Directs 2005 sales, including shipping revenue, increased by 1.1%. Online store sales had a double digit increase. In February 2005, we reduced our shipping fees, which drove additional online sales but reduced our overall shipping revenue. As part of the multi channel strategy (see page 6), we reduced our Direct catalog mailings significantly beginning in July 2005 and we shifted the merchandise offering to be more aligned with the Full Line stores. The decrease in the number of Direct catalog mailings, along with a continuing shift of catalog customers to our online store, resulted in a drop in catalog sales in 2005. Total net sales also increased as a result of our same store sales increases as well as from the six Full Line stores opened since February 2004. 2007 FORECAST OF SAME STORE SALES In 2007, we plan to open three Full Line stores and one Rack store, increasing retail square footage by approximately 2.4%. We are assuming low single digit same store sales growth in our Full Line and Rack stores, with a higher growth rate for Nordstrom Direct. In total, we expect 2007 same store sales to increase 3% to 4%. Nordstrom, Inc. and subsidiaries 15 Table of Contents Gross Profit (Dollars in Millions Except Per Square Foot Amounts) Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Gross profit $3,206.7 $2,834.8 $2,572.0 Gross profit rate 37.5% 36.7% 36.1% Average inventory per square foot $52.37 $51.25 $52.46 Inventory turnover rate* 5.06 4.84 4.51 * Inventory turnover rate calculated as 5 quarter average inventory divided by annual cost of sales. 2006 VS 2005 GROSS PROFIT Our gross profit rate improved 75 basis points, driven primarily by expansion of our merchandise margin rate. All major merchandise categories contributed to this rate expansion, in part due to an increase of regular price merchandise sales. Our womens apparel category experienced significant rate expansion in the second half of the year due to strategy changes that brought a sharper focus to our merchandise offering. For the first time, this year our buying and occupancy costs included expenses related to stock options awarded primarily to our merchant and product development groups. These costs were $11.9 and impacted our gross profit rate by 14 basis points. Despite this additional expense, we leveraged our buying and occupancy costs on sales growth. Sales growth and continued inventory discipline resulted in improvement in our inventory turnover rate, which increased 4.5%. 2005 VS 2004 GROSS PROFIT While we showed growth in our same store sales in 2005, we held buying and occupancy costs relatively consistent with 2004. In addition, our merchandise costs increased in line with our sales increases. As a result, we drove a gross profit rate improvement of 60 basis points. Our inventory turnover rate improved 7.3% in 2005, indicating that our merchandise planning and execution have continued to improve. 2007 FORECAST OF GROSS PROFIT In 2007, if we achieve our planned same store sales growth, we expect a net 30 to 40 basis point improvement in our gross profit rate from continued sales leverage on buying and occupancy costs along with improved merchandise margin. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (Dollars in Millions) Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Selling, general and administrative expenses $2,296.9 $2,100.7 $2,020.2 Selling, general and administrative rate 26.8% 27.2% 28.3% 2006 VS 2005 SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES We expect our selling, general and administrative rate to decrease when sales increase as we gain leverage on our fixed overhead costs. This rate decreased in 2006, but the decrease was less than the 2005 improvement. In 2005, our selling, general, and administrative rate was reduced by 24 basis points for favorable developments in our workers compensation reserve. In 2006, our selling, general and administrative rate was unfavorably impacted by 20 basis points for new stock option expenses from the adoption of Statement No. 123(R), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)). 2005 VS 2004 SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES The primary component of our selling, general and administrative expenses that varies with our same store sales is our selling costs. Most of our other expenses do not fluctuate with changes in our same store sales. In 2005, as our same store sales increased 6.0%, our general and administrative expenses were essentially in line with 2004 and we benefited from a favorable adjustment to our workers compensation reserve. These factors combined to give us a 110 basis point decrease in our selling, general and administrative rate. 2007 FORECAST OF SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES In 2007, our selling, general and administrative rate is expected to increase by 5 to 15 basis points due to the impact of an upcoming securitization transaction (see Off Balance Sheet Financing on page 21) and incremental new store pre opening costs (see Investing Activities on page 20). These two factors, which are expected to increase our selling, general and administrative expenses by $37 to $47, or 45 to 55 basis points, will offset the expected 35 to 45 basis points of rate improvement from additional sales leverage on fixed overhead costs. 16 Table of Contents Interest Expense, Net (Dollars in Millions) Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Interest expense, net $42.8 $45.3 $77.4 2006 VS 2005 INTEREST EXPENSE, NET Interest expense, net decreased $2.5 in 2006 compared to 2005. The decrease is primarily due to increased interest income from higher average cash investment balances. 2005 VS 2004 INTEREST EXPENSE, NET Interest expense, net decreased $32.1 in 2005 compared to 2004. The decrease is primarily due to debt prepayment costs of $20.9 incurred in 2004 in connection with a $198.2 debt buyback. We did not incur similar costs in 2005. 2007 FORECAST OF INTEREST EXPENSE, NET We expect interest expense, net to be flat in 2007 due to the upcoming securitization transaction (see Off Balance Sheet Financing on page 21). Other Income Including Finance Charges, Net (Dollars in Millions) Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Other income including finance charges, net $238.5 $196.4 $172.9 Other income including finance charges, net as a percentage of net sales 2.8% 2.5% 2.4% 2006 VS 2005 OTHER INCOME INCLUDING FINANCE CHARGES, NET Other income including finance charges, net increased $42.2, primarily due to growth in the co branded VISA credit card program. The principal balances of receivables in the VISA credit card, which are held by a separate trust in which we hold a certificated interest, increased 22.9% during 2006. The receivables growth increase produces an increase in the trusts earnings and our income. In addition, income from finance charges on our private label card has increased due to program growth. In July 2006, we received $5.6 of proceeds from the VISA Check/Master Money Antitrust Litigation. These proceeds were recorded as a gain in the second quarter of 2006 in other income including finance charges, net. 2005 VS 2004 OTHER INCOME INCLUDING FINANCE CHARGES, NET Other income including finance charges, net increased $23.4, due to earnings growth in the Nordstrom fsb co branded VISA credit card program and our gift card breakage income of $8.0. The principal balances of receivables in the VISA credit card, which are held by a separate trust in which we hold a certificated interest, increased 20.6% during 2005. Gift card breakage income was a new component of income in 2005. Unclaimed property legislation changed in 2004 to allow us to retain unused balances on gift cards. We analyzed the experience of our program since it was introduced in 1999, and we determined that balances remaining on cards issued five years ago are unlikely to be redeemed. The breakage income recognized in 2005 includes $2.6 and $5.4 for cards issued in 1999 and 2000. Breakage income is approximately 3.5% of the amount of initially issued gift cards. 2007 FORECAST OF OTHER INCOME INCLUDING FINANCE CHARGES, NET In 2007, other income including finance charges, net is expected to increase approximately $25.0 to $35.0. The co branded VISA receivables will be recorded on the balance sheet initially at fair value with no allowance for credit losses. Normal write offs for uncollectible VISA receivables, estimated at $19 along with other costs net at $4, will be recorded in other income including finance charges, net over the eight month period following the transaction. Nordstrom, Inc. and subsidiaries 17 Table of Contents Income Tax Expense (Dollars in Millions) Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Income tax expense $427.7 $333.9 $253.8 Effective tax rate 38.7% 37.7% 39.2% 2006 VS 2005 INCOME TAX EXPENSE Our expected effective tax rate, considering the federal tax rate of 35.0% and the net effect of state income taxes, is 38.5%. Our actual effective tax rate was slightly higher than our expected rate because our estimates of the taxes due for prior years increased based on recent developments. 2005 VS 2004 INCOME TAX EXPENSE In 2005, our actual effective tax rate was below our expected 38.5% because our 2004 tax expense, which was finalized in the third quarter of 2005, was less than we planned; we reduced our reserve when the audits of our 2000 and 2001 federal tax returns were completed; and, we utilized a larger than previously estimated amount of our capital loss carryforward. 2007 FORECAST OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE In 2007, we expect our effective tax rate to be 38.5%. Net Earnings and Earnings per Diluted Share (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Net earnings $678.0 $551.3 $393.5 Net earnings as a percentage of net sales 7.9% 7.1% 5.5% Earnings per diluted share $2.55 $1.98 $1.38 2006 VS 2005 NET EARNINGS AND EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE Our 7.5% same store sales increase combined with gross profit rate improvement and sales leverage on selling, general and administrative expenses drove net earnings of $678.0 and earnings per diluted share of $2.55. During the year, we repurchased 16.5 million shares of our common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by $0.10. The 53rd week contributed $0.02 to earnings per diluted share. 2005 VS 2004 NET EARNINGS AND EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE In 2005, net earnings increased 40.1% and earnings per diluted share increased 43.5% as a result of our same store sales growth and sales leverage on buying and occupancy and general and administrative expenses. In 2004, we incurred prepayment costs and wrote off deferred debt costs totaling $20.9, or $0.05 per diluted share, upon prepayment of $198.2 of long term debt. We did not incur similar costs in 2005. 2007 FORECAST OF EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE We expect our earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.78 to $2.84 in 2007. The securitization transaction is expected to impact earnings per diluted share by $0.05 and the incremental pre opening costs for new stores are expected to impact earnings per diluted share by $0.03. Fourth Quarter Results (Dollars in Millions) Net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2006 were $232.3 compared with $190.4 in 2005. Total sales for the quarter increased 14.6% to $2,630.9 and same store sales increased by 8.3%. Sales in the 53rd week of $117.7 represented 5.1% of the total percentage increase versus the prior year. Strong regular price sales across all major merchandise categories throughout the quarter and a successful holiday season resulted in same store sales growth above our overall sales plan. Our designer apparel, accessories, mens apparel, and cosmetics merchandise categories experienced the largest same store sales increases. As it did in the third quarter, our womens apparel category had a mid single digit increase. Our gross profit rate increased to 38.3% from 37.5% last year. Merchandise margin improved versus the prior year, driven mainly by lower markdowns and higher sell through of inventory, especially in womens apparel. Our selling, general and administrative rate improved 20 basis points from 26.2% to 26.0%. Overall, expenses during the fourth quarter trended in line with the improved performance in sales and gross profit compared to last year. Performance based incentive compensation costs driven by goals for total year results and share price appreciation accelerated above plan, as fiscal 2006 sales, gross profit, and earnings before income tax expense results exceeded our plan. 18 Table of Contents Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) (Non GAAP financial measure) (Dollars in Millions) In the past two years, we have incorporated Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) into our key financial metrics, and since 2005 have used it as an executive incentive measure. Overall performance as measured by ROIC correlates directly to shareholders return over the long term. For the 12 fiscal months ended February 3, 2007, we improved our ROIC to 20.9% compared to 16.9% for the 12 months ended January 28, 2006. Our ROIC improved primarily from increased earnings before interest and taxes. See our GAAP ROIC reconciliation below. The closest GAAP measure is return on assets, which improved to 14.0% from 11.5% for the last 12 months ended February 3, 2007 compared to the 12 months ended January 28, 2006. We define ROIC as follows: ROIC Net Operating Profit after Taxes (NOPAT) Average Invested Capital Numerator NOPAT Denominator Average Invested Capital Net earnings Average total assets Income tax expense average non interest bearing current liabilities Interest expense, net average deferred property incentives EBIT average estimated asset base of capitalized operating leases Rent expense Average invested capital Estimated depreciation on capitalized operating leases Net operating profit Estimated income tax expense NOPAT 12 fiscal months ended February 3, 2007 January 28, 2006 Net earnings $678.0 $551.3 Add: income tax expense 427.7 333.9 Add: interest expense, net 42.7 45.3 Earnings before interest and income tax expense 1,148.4 930.5 Add: rent expense 47.6 41.5 Less: estimated depreciation on capitalized operating leases1 (25.4 ) (22.1 ) Net operating profit 1,170.6 949.9 Estimated income tax expense (452.4 ) (358.7 ) Net operating profit after taxes $718.2 $591.2 Average total assets2 $4,854.1 $4,800.7 Less: average non interest bearing current liabilities3 (1,424.0 ) (1,320.6 ) Less: average deferred property incentives2 (357.9 ) (364.5 ) Add: average estimated asset base of capitalized operating leases4 361.6 384.7 Average invested capital $3,433.8 $3,500.3 Return on assets 14.0% 11.5% ROIC 20.9% 16.9% 1 Depreciation based upon estimated asset base of capitalized operating leases as described in Note 4 below. 2 Based upon the trailing 12 month average. 3 Based upon the trailing 12 month average for accounts payable, accrued salaries, wages and related benefits, other current liabilities and income taxes payable. 4 Based upon the trailing 12 month average of the monthly asset base which is calculated as the trailing 12 months rent expense multiplied by 8. Nordstrom, Inc. and subsidiaries 19 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (Dollars in Millions) Overall, cash decreased by $60.1 to $402.6 as of February 3, 2007. Over the course of the year, we sold $350.0 of our interest in the co branded VISA receivables primarily to retire $300.0 of debt, and we repurchased $621.5 worth of stock. Our strong cash flow and low debt levels place us in a position of flexibility to support our value growth plan. Operating Activities (Dollars in Millions) 2006 VS 2005 OPERATING ACTIVITIES Net cash flow from operating activities increased from $776.2 to $1,142.4, an increase of $366.2 primarily because we reduced our investment in asset backed securities by $350.0 to fund the repayment of $300.0 of private label securitization debt. Also, we were successful in expanding our private label charge card and co branded Nordstrom VISA credit card programs, which increased our investment in these programs but provided increased earnings. 2005 VS 2004 OPERATING ACTIVITIES Net cash flow from operating activities increased from $606.3 to $776.2, an increase of $169.9 primarily due to the growth in our net earnings. Our co branded VISA credit card program continued to grow in 2005 as we increased the capital we allocate to fund this program. Under our co branded VISA program, we earn interchange and finance charge income and we offer card holders merchandise certificates, which can be redeemed in our stores, similar to a gift certificate. In the course of negotiating for store locations, some developers offer up front cash payments to defray our capital expenditures in exchange for our commitment to operate a store in their development. In 2005, we received incentives totaling $49.5, which is an increase of $29.6 over 2004. Property incentive receipts vary year to year, depending on the number of our store openings and remodels and the arrangements we negotiate with developers. 2007 FORECAST FOR OPERATING ACTIVITIES In 2007, we will move the co branded VISA receivables onto our balance sheet as part of the securitization transition (see Off Balance Sheet Financing on page 21). We expect operating cash flows to decrease due to this change and receivable growth. Increased net earnings are expected to partially offset this decrease. Investing Activities (Dollars in Millions) In the past three years, we have had two principal types of investing activities: capital expenditures and short term investments. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Our annual capital expenditures ranged from $246.9 to $271.7 between 2004 and 2006. The largest components of these expenditures were for new or relocated stores and store remodels. In 2006 we opened one Full Line store at The Gardens Mall in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, we relocated our Topanga store in Canoga Park, California and we opened one Rack store at Grand Plaza in San Marcos, California. Together these openings increased our gross square footage approximately 1.2%. Our total square footage as of February 3, 2007 was 20.2 million. In 2006, 35% of our capital expenditures were for new or relocated stores, 32% were for major remodels and 7% were for minor remodels. In addition, 13% of our capital expenditures were for information technology and 13% were for other projects. Our capital expenditures over the last three years totaled $782.9. These capital expenditures were offset by property incentives of $100.0. With these capital expenditures, we added stores, enhanced existing facilities and improved our information systems. More than 1.0 million square feet of retail store space have been added during this period, representing an increase of 5.4% since January 31, 2004. We expect that our capital expenditures will be approximately $2,800.0 over the next five years, with $520.0 to $540.0 planned for 2007. We plan to use 52% of this investment to build new stores, 27% on remodels, 9% on information technology and 12% for minor remodels and other projects. Compared to the previous five years, capital expenditures will increase 138%, with increased spending allocated to new stores. Our current strategy calls for a 4% to 5% annual increase in square footage growth, with 26 new or relocated stores announced through 2011; over half of these stores will be in our Northeast and Midwest regions. The estimated capital project spending does not include potential investments in new stores resulting from the current industry consolidation. We believe we have the capacity to address additional capital investments should opportunities arise. In the second half of 2007, we expect to open three new Full Line stores and one Rack store, and in the first quarter of 2008, we expect to open four new Full Line stores. We typically incur the majority of our pre opening costs in the six months prior to opening. In 2007, new store pre opening costs, which will be recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, are expected to impact our earnings per diluted share by $0.03. As of February 3, 2007, we were contractually committed to spend $32.2 for constructing new stores, remodeling existing stores, and other capital projects. SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS In 2006, we sold our short term investments and primarily used the proceeds for common stock repurchases. 20 Table of Contents Financing Activities (Dollars in Millions) Over the past three years, our net operating cash inflows have exceeded our net investing cash outflows, and we used this excess cash flow to repay long term debt, pay dividends, and to repurchase our common stock. Over this three year period, the price of our common stock has increased, which spurred stock option exercises that also increased our net cash. DEBT RETIREMENT The following table outlines our debt retirement activity: Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Principal repaid or retired: Private Label Securitization, 4.82%, due 2006 $300.0 Senior notes, 8.95%, due 2005 $196.8 Notes payable, 6.7%, due 2005 $96.0 $1.5 Total $300.0 $96.0 $198.3 Total cash payment $300.0 $96.0 $220.1 We retired the $300.0, 4.82% Private Label Securitization debt when it matured in October 2006. We repaid the remaining $96.0 of our 6.7% medium term notes when they matured in 2005. The cash payments in 2004 that exceeded the principal retired represent early prepayment premiums. SHARE REPURCHASE In August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized $300.0 of share repurchases, replacing a previous share repurchase authorization. By the end of 2004, we purchased 13.8 million shares in the open market for the entire authorized amount of $300.0 at an average price of $21.71 per share. In February 2005, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $500.0 of share repurchases. Overall for 2005, we purchased 8.5 million shares for $287.1 at an average price of $33.80 per share. We utilized the remaining authorization of $212.9 in February and March of 2006, purchasing 5.4 million shares at an average price of $39.27 per share. Our Board of Directors authorized an additional $1,000.0 of share repurchases in May 2006. During the remainder of the year we repurchased 11.1 million shares for $408.6 at an average price of $36.74. As of February 3, 2007 the unused authorization was $591.4. The actual amount and timing of future share repurchases will be subject to market conditions and applicable SEC rules. Debt to Capital Ratio Our recent favorable operating results increased our shareholders equity and allowed us to reduce our long term debt, which contributed to a decrease in our debt to capital ratio from 36.5% at the end of 2004 to 22.5% at the end of 2006. In the third quarter of 2006, we repaid $300.0 of long term debt by selling a portion of our interest in the co branded Nordstrom VISA receivable trust. This arrangement put us below our target debt to capital range of 25% to 40%. In the first quarter of 2007, we will be increasing our debt and asset levels as a result of a new co branded Nordstrom VISA securitization transaction. Both the co branded Nordstrom VISA receivables and the debt backed by those receivables will be recorded on our balance sheet. In anticipation of this new securitization structure, we are adjusting our target debt to capital ratio range to 30% to 45% going forward. Off Balance Sheet Financing (Dollars in Millions) Through our wholly owned federal savings bank, Nordstrom fsb, we offer a private label charge card and two co branded Nordstrom VISA credit cards. The private label charge card receivables are held in a trust, which may issue third party debt that is securitized by the private label receivables; the private label program is treated as on balance sheet, with the receivables, net of bad debt allowance, and debt, if any, recorded on our balance sheet, the finance charge income recorded in other income including finance charges, net, and the bad debt expense recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. The co branded Nordstrom VISA credit card receivables are held in a separate trust (the VISA Trust), which may issue third party debt that is securitized by the co branded Nordstrom VISA credit card receivables. The co branded Nordstrom VISA credit card program is treated as off balance sheet. We record the fair value of our interest in the VISA Trust on our balance sheet, gains on the sale of receivables to the VISA Trust and our share of the VISA Trusts finance income in other income including finance charges, net. As of February 3, 2007, the VISA Trust had co branded Nordstrom VISA credit card receivables with a total face amount of $908.0 and had outstanding two series of notes held by third parties: $200.0 of 2002 Class AB notes that mature in April 2007, and $350.0 of 2004 2 variable funding notes that may be renewed in August 2007. In fiscal 2006, the co branded Nordstrom VISA credit card receivables had an average gross yield of 16.8% and average annual credit losses of 2.8%. The weighted average interest rate on the third party notes was 5.3%. Following the repayment of the VISA Trusts $200.0 notes in April 2007, we plan to merge the private label charge card and co branded VISA programs into one securitization program. The advantage of a combined program is that it will provide us with greater borrowing flexibility as we will be able to borrow funds based on the outstanding balance of the combined receivables, it will lower our administrative costs, and will give us one method of accounting for these similar programs on balance sheet. When we combine these programs, we plan to also increase our borrowing against these combined receivables to a range of $800.0 to $900.0. Nordstrom, Inc. and subsidiaries 21 Table of Contents In the first quarter, the VISA Trust requires that cash receipts be used to establish a pre funding account to repay the 2002 AB Notes; this pre funding balance reduces the overall yield in the VISA Trust, which is expected to reduce our earnings by $7.0. After we combine the securitization programs in April 2007, our investment in the VISA Trust will be reclassified from available for sale securities to receivables, at fair value with no allowance for credit losses. Based on past payment patterns, these receivables will be repaid within eight months. During that time, we expect to record incremental bad debt write offs and certain finance charge income as an adjustment to the fair value of the receivables acquired, reducing the yield of these receivables; these costs are expected to be $16.0 and will be recorded over the eight month repayment period. Following the recognition of the $7.0 yield reduction in the first quarter and the $16.0 of other adjustments through the remainder of 2007, the private label charge card receivables and the co branded VISA credit card receivables will be recorded at historical cost, net of bad debt allowances, on our balance sheet. As card holders continue to use their co branded VISA credit cards, new receivables will be recorded. Those new receivables will be recorded at historical cost; as those receivables age, we will establish an allowance for bad debts based on historical write off experience. We expect to record $25.0 to $35.0 of bad debt provision in selling, general and administrative expenses from these new receivables. The classification of this expense is different because these receivables are on balance sheet, in the past, the write off experience was considered in our investment yield and reflected in other income including finance charges, net. We do not expect the co branded VISA credit card receivable write off experience to be impacted by the transition in the accounting treatment, only the classification of this expense will change. As noted above, all debt issued by the combined trust will be recorded on our balance sheet, so the related interest expense will be recorded in interest expense, net. Currently, the interest expense of the debt issued by the VISA Trust reduces our overall yield from our investment and is recognized in other income including finance charges, net. With the bad debt and interest expense impacts shifting out of other income including finance charges, net, we expect our other income line item on our earnings statement to increase by $45.0 to $55.0. We expect our earnings before income tax expense to be reduced by $23.0, or $0.05 per diluted share, for the transition from fair value to historical cost. The other earnings statement classification changes associated with the accounting treatment for the combined securitization program are not expected to impact our earnings before income tax expense. In the future, our ROIC rate will be reduced because we will recognize additional invested capital from the securitization program transition. Interest Rate Swaps (Dollars in Millions) To manage our interest rate risk, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in 2003, which had a $250.0 notional amount expiring in January 2009. Under the agreement, we receive a fixed rate of 5.63% and pay a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a margin of 2.3% set at six month intervals (7.70% at February 3, 2007). The interest rate swap agreement had a fair value of $(8.9) and $(11.1) at the end of 2006 and 2005. Contractual Obligations (Dollars in Millions) The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and the expected effect on our liquidity and cash flows as of February 3, 2007. We expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business and credit available to us under existing and potential future facilities. Less than More than Total 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years 5 years Long term debt $630.9 $5.9 $262.3 $9.9 $352.8 Capital lease obligations 13.5 1.9 3.3 2.4 5.9 Other long term liabilities 222.3 30.8 40.3 20.2 131.0 Operating leases 650.2 78.0 148.1 130.5 293.6 Purchase obligations 1,070.0 1,056.1 12.7 1.0 0.2 Total $2,586.9 $1,172.7 $466.7 $164.0 $783.5 In addition to the required debt repayments disclosed above, we estimate total interest payments of approximately $512.6 as of February 3, 2007, payable over the remaining life of the debts. Other long term liabilities consist of workers compensation and general liability insurance reserves and postretirement benefits. The repayment amounts presented above were determined based on historical payment trends. Other long term liabilities not requiring cash payments, such as deferred property incentives, were excluded from the table above. Purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for unreceived goods or services and capital expenditure commitments. This table also excludes the short term liabilities, other than the current portion of long term debt, disclosed on our 2006 balance sheet, as the amounts recorded for these items will be paid in the next year. Long term debt excludes debt issued by the VISA Trust, including $200.0 off balance sheet receivable backed securities due in April 2007 and $350.0 variable funding note that can be renewed in August 2007. 22 Table of Contents Credit Capacity and Commitments (Dollars in Millions) The following table summarizes our amount of commitment expiration per period: Total Amounts Less than More than Committed 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years 5 years Other commercial commitments $600.0 variable funding note $350.0 $350.0 $500.0 unsecured line of credit, none outstanding Standby letters of credit Import letters of credit 9.8 9.8 Total $359.8 $359.8 In June and October 2006, we amended our existing variable funding facility backed by Nordstrom private label card and VISA credit card receivables to increase the capacity of this facility to $600.0. Borrowings under the facility will incur interest based upon the actual cost of commercial paper plus specified fees ranging from 0.075% to 0.15%. As of February 3, 2007, the facilitys interest rate was 5.42%. We pay a commitment fee ranging from 0.125% to 0.15% for the note based on the amount of the commitment. Fee rates decrease if more than $50,000 is outstanding on the facility. The facility can be cancelled or not renewed if our debt ratings fall below Standard and Poors BB rating or Moodys Ba1 rating. In November 2005, we replaced our existing $350.0 unsecured line of credit with a $500.0 unsecured line of credit, which is available as liquidity support for our commercial paper program. Under the terms of the agreement, we pay a variable rate of interest and a commitment fee based on our debt rating. Based upon our current debt rating, we pay a variable rate of interest of LIBOR plus a margin of 0.225% (5.62% at February 3, 2007) on the outstanding balance and an annual commitment fee of 0.075% on the total capacity. The variable rate of interest increases to LIBOR plus a margin of 0.325% if more than $250.0 is outstanding on the facility. The line of credit expires in November 2010, and contains restrictive covenants, which include maintaining a leverage ratio. We did not make any borrowings under this unsecured line of credit during the last three fiscal years. We also have universal shelf registrations on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to offer an additional $450.0 of securities to the public. These registration statements allow us to issue various types of securities, including debt, common stock, warrants to purchase common stock, warrants to purchase debt securities and warrants to purchase or sell foreign currency. Debt Ratings The following table shows our credit ratings at the date of this report: Standard Credit Ratings Moodys and Poors Senior unsecured debt Baa1 A Commercial paper P 2 A 1 Outlook Positive Stable These ratings could change depending on our performance and other factors. Our outstanding debt is not subject to termination or interest rate adjustments based on changes in our credit ratings. Dividends In February 2007 we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.135 per share, increased from $0.105 per share in the prior year. In 2006, we paid dividends of $0.42 per share, the tenth consecutive year that our annual dividends increased. We paid dividends of $0.32 and $0.24 in 2005 and 2004. In determining the amount of dividends to pay, we analyze our dividend payout ratio, dividend yield and balance the dividend payment with our operating performance and capital resources. We target a dividend payout ratio of approximately 18% to 20% of net income, although the ratio has been slightly lower the last two years as a result of the significant increase in our net earnings. For the dividend yield, which is calculated as our dividends per share divided by our stock price, we target a 1% long term yield. While we plan to increase dividends over time, we will balance future increases with our operating performance and available capital resources. Liquidity We maintain a level of liquidity to allow us to cover our seasonal cash needs and to minimize our need for short term borrowings. We believe that our operating cash flows, existing cash and available credit facilities are sufficient to finance our cash requirements for the next 12 months. Over the long term, we manage our cash and capital structure to maximize shareholder return, strengthen our financial position and maintain flexibility for future strategic initiatives. We continuously assess our debt and leverage levels, capital expenditure requirements, principal debt payments, dividend payouts, potential share repurchases and future investments or acquisitions. We believe our operating cash flows, existing cash and available credit facilities, as well as any potential future borrowing facilities, will be sufficient to fund these scheduled future payments and potential long term initiatives. Nordstrom, Inc. and subsidiaries 23 Table of Contents In 2000, the company acquired Faonnable, S.A.S., a collection of high quality mens, womens and boys apparel and accessories. In February 2007, we announced that we are exploring strategic options that would benefit both Nordstrom and Faonnable, including a possible sale of the brand. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The following discussion highlights the policies we feel are critical. Off Balance Sheet Financing Our co branded Nordstrom VISA credit card receivables are transferred to a third party trust on a daily basis. The balance of the receivables transferred to the trust fluctuates as new receivables are generated and old receivables are retired (through payments received, charge offs, or credits from merchandise returns). The trust issues securities that are backed by the receivables. Certain of these securities or beneficial interests are sold to third party investors and those remaining securities are issued to us. We recognize gains or losses on the sale of the co branded Nordstrom VISA receivables to the trust based on the difference between the face value of the receivables sold and the estimated fair value of the assets created in the securitization process. The fair value of the assets is calculated as the present value of their expected cash flows. The discount rate used to calculate fair value represents the volatility and risk of the assets. Assumptions and judgments are made to estimate the fair value of our investment in asset backed securities. We have no other off balance sheet transactions. Inventory Our merchandise inventories are primarily stated at the lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method (first in, first out basis). Under the retail method, the valuation of inventories and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of ending inventory. To determine if the retail value of our inventory should be marked down, we consider current and anticipated demand, customer preferences, age of the merchandise and fashion trends. As our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. We also reserve for obsolescence based on historical trends and specific identification. Shrinkage is estimated as a percentage of net sales for the period from the most recent semi annual inventory count based on historical shrinkage results. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenues net of estimated returns and we exclude sales taxes. Our retail stores record revenue at the point of sale. Our catalog and online sales include shipping revenue and are recorded upon estimated delivery to the customer. As part of the normal sales cycle, we receive customer merchandise returns. To recognize the financial impact of sales returns, we estimate the amount of goods that will be returned and reduce sales and cost of sales accordingly. We utilize historical return patterns to estimate our expected returns. Vendor Allowances We receive allowances from merchandise vendors for purchase price adjustments, cooperative advertising programs, cosmetic selling expenses and vendor sponsored contests. Purchase price adjustments are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales after an agreement with the vendor is executed and the related merchandise has been sold. Allowances for cooperative advertising programs and vendor sponsored contests are recorded in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses as a reduction to the related cost when incurred. Allowances for cosmetic selling expenses are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses as a reduction to the related cost when incurred. Any allowances in excess of actual costs are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales. Self Insurance We retain a portion of the risk for certain losses related to health and welfare, workers compensation and general liability claims. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both losses reported and losses incurred but not yet reported. We estimate our ultimate cost based on internal analysis of historical data and independent actuarial estimates. Favorable trends in California caused a decrease in our workers compensation costs in 2005. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Our allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of the losses inherent in our private label credit card receivable as of the balance sheet date. We evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on several factors, including historical trends of aging of accounts, write off experience and expectations of future performance. We recognize finance charges on delinquent accounts until the account is written off. Delinquent accounts are written off when they are determined to be uncollectible, usually after the passage of 151 days without receiving a full scheduled monthly payment. Accounts are written off sooner in the event of customer bankruptcy or other circumstances that make further collection unlikely. Intangible Asset Impairment Testing We review our goodwill and acquired tradename annually for impairment in the first quarter or when circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. The goodwill and acquired tradename associated with our Faonnable business are our largest impairment risk. The fair value of our intangible assets has exceeded their carrying value in each of the most recent three years. 24 Table of Contents Leases We lease the land or the land and building at many of our Full Line stores, and we lease the building at many of our Rack stores. Additionally, we lease office facilities, warehouses and equipment. We recognize lease expense on a straight line basis over the minimum lease term. In 2004, we corrected our lease accounting policy to recognize lease expense, net of property incentives, from the time that we control the leased property. We recorded a charge of $7.8 ($4.7 net of tax) in the fourth quarter of 2004 to correct this accounting policy. The impact of this change was immaterial to prior periods. Many of our leases include options that allow us to extend the lease term beyond the initial commitment period, subject to terms agreed to at lease inception. For leases that contain rent holiday periods and scheduled rent increases, we record the difference between the rent expense and the rental amount payable under the leases in liabilities. Some leases require additional payments based on sales and are recorded in rent expense when the contingent rent is probable. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), which requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, accounting for income taxes in interim periods, and income tax disclosures. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective for us as of the beginning of our 2007 fiscal year. We will adopt FIN 48 in the first quarter of 2007, as required. We continue to evaluate the impact of adoption, but expect that it will not be material. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are assessing the potential impact on our financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. INTEREST RATE RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates. In seeking to minimize risk, we manage exposure through our regular operating and financing activities. We do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and are not party to any leveraged financial instruments. Interest rate exposure is managed through our mix of fixed and variable rate borrowings. Short term borrowing and investing activities generally bear interest at variable rates, but because they have maturities of three months or less, we believe that the risk of material loss was low, and that the carrying amount approximated fair value. The table below presents information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, which consist of debt obligations and interest rate swaps for the year ended February 3, 2007. For debt obligations, the table presents principal amounts, at book value, by maturity date, and related weighted average interest rates. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected (contractual) maturity dates. Notional amounts are the predetermined dollar principal on which the exchanged interest payments are based.

However, we periodically enter into foreign currency purchase orders denominated in Euros for apparel, accessories and shoes. We use forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices. We do not believe the fair value of our outstanding forward contracts at February 3, 2007 to be material. In addition, the functional currency of Faonnable, S.A.S. of Nice, France is the Euro. Assets and liabilities of Faonnable are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing at the end of the period. Income and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars at an average exchange rate during the period. Foreign currency gains and losses from the translation of Faonnables balance sheet and income statement are included in other comprehensive earnings. Foreign currency gains or losses from certain intercompany loans are recorded in other income including finance charges, net. Nordstrom, Inc. and subsidiaries 25 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Nordstrom is a fashion specialty retailer offering high quality apparel, shoes, cosmetics and accessories for women, men and children. We offer a wide selection of brand name and private label merchandise. We offer our products through multiple retail channels including our Full Line Nordstrom stores, our discount Nordstrom Rack stores, our Faonnable boutiques, our catalogs and on the Internet at www.nordstrom.com. Our stores are located throughout the United States and we have 36 Faonnable boutiques located in France, Portugal, and Belgium. In addition, we offer our customers a variety of payment products and services including our loyalty program. STRATEGIC INITIATIVES We believe we are well positioned to grow the value of our business by executing our strategy through the following key initiatives: enhancing our merchandise offering within our existing product categories, improving the shopping experience for our customers across all channels, and continuing to increase our presence where our customers shop. Merchandise Strategies Weve found that theres a great deal of opportunity to grow our sales in existing stores simply by earning a greater share of our customers business across multiple product categories. Our new systems and merchandising disciplines have helped us begin to take advantage of opportunities for increased sales by enhancing our ability to keep inventories fresh and turn them more rapidly. Customers are responding favorably to newness across all merchandise categories, leading to meaningful gains in areas such as mens apparel, accessories, womens and kids shoes and cosmetics throughout 2006. A consistently strong performer in 2006 was our designer category, including apparel, shoes and accessories merchandise. We are continuing to expand our offering of designer merchandise. Multi Channel Shopping Experience Our future success continues to depend upon our ability to provide our customers with a superior and fully integrated shopping experience. As a multi channel retailer, we are uniquely positioned to respond to evolving customer needs and expectations. The necessary resources have been committed and critical projects are underway in this effort. We are installing a new inventory system, and we are expanding both our fulfillment and call centers in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Our online store is essential to creating relationships with many of our most active and loyal customers. Many customers who start shopping with us online migrate to our stores. By giving customers a more similar shopping experience in store and online, were making progress to become more relevant to todays shoppers. Increase Our Presence Given the industry consolidation impacting many of our competitors, we see potential to gain market share and grow our business by increasing our presence where our customers live. Fortunately, we are in an advantageous position to reach new customers through building stores and enhancing our current ones. Weve recently launched a $2.8 billion capital plan, with 80% of the dollars allocated to customer facing investments, primarily new stores, remodels and relocations. We will continue with a disciplined approach to real estate acquisitions, adding new stores when and where they pass our criteria. Our current strategy calls for a 4% to 5% increase in square footage growth through 2011 with 26 new or relocated stores announced through 2011. OVERVIEW For the first time in our history, our earnings before income tax expense exceeded $1 billion in 2006. This result was driven primarily by the combination of continued sales growth, gross profit rate expansion and leverage of selling, general and administrative expenses. Key highlights include: We achieved positive same store sales growth for the fifth year in a row. Same store sales increased 7.5% on top of our 6.0% increase in 2005 and our 8.5% increase in 2004. Our gross profit rate increased 75 basis points primarily due to merchandise margin expansion. With the sales growth mentioned above, we leveraged our overhead costs, resulting in a 37 basis point improvement in our selling, general and administrative expense rate. Full year earnings per diluted share increased 28.8% over last year to $2.55. Like many other retailers, Nordstrom follows the retail 4 5 4 reporting calendar, which included an extra week in fiscal 2006 (the 53rd week). The 53rd week is not included in same store sales calculations. 14 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales (Dollars in Millions) Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Net sales $8,560.7 $7,722.9 $7,131.4 Net sales increase 10.8% 8.3% 10.6% Same store sales increase 7.5% 6.0% 8.5% Percentage of net sales by merchandise category: Womens apparel 35% 35% 36% Shoes 20% 21% 20% Mens apparel 18% 18% 18% Cosmetics 11% 11% 11% Womens accessories 10% 9% 9% Childrens apparel 3% 3% 3% Other 3% 3% 3% 2006 VS 2005 NET SALES All of our Full Line store regions and most of our Full Line store merchandise categories had same store sales increases. Our Full Line stores had a 5.9% same store sales increase, ahead of last years result of 5.4%. Some other retailers who combine an offering of high end merchandise and customer service continued to experience positive sales growth in 2006. Our largest same store sales increases came from our accessories, cosmetics and mens apparel merchandise categories. Womens apparel experienced same store sales decreases in the first half of the year, but had same store sales increases in the second half, resulting in a low single digit increase for the full year. The designer category, which benefited from additional investment because it is an important component of our merchandise strategy, had a double digit same store sales increase. Our Rack same store sales increased 10.9% in 2006, on top of last years 14.8% increase. Rack purchases the majority of its merchandise from third parties and serves as a clearance channel for our Full Line stores. The sales growth came from all regions and merchandise categories. Our online store sales drove Nordstrom Directs 2006 total net sales increase of 23.0%. Our online sales benefited from the overall Internet marketplace expansion, driven by the continued adoption of higher speed Internet connections which allow for convenient and efficient shopping, as well as utilization of the Internet as a tool for research and information before making a purchase decision. Catalog sales experienced an overall decline because we reduced our catalog mailings beginning in the middle of 2005. Total net sales increased 10.8% as a result of our same store sales increases as well as from the five Full Line stores and one Rack store opened since February 2005. We also relocated one Full Line store and expanded one Rack store, which contributed to our increase in total net sales. In the 53rd week, we had sales of $117.7. Sales for the 53rd week represented 1.5% of the total percentage increase versus the prior year. 2005 VS 2004 NET SALES In our Full Line stores, our accessories, cosmetics and mens apparel merchandise categories experienced the largest same store sales increases. Our shoes division had same store sales increases. Our womens apparel merchandise category had mixed same store sales performance; womens intimate, junior and contemporary apparel were the leaders in the womens category, while womens special sizes, better and bridge apparel had same store sales decreases in 2005. Our Rack same store sales increased 14.8% in 2005, on top of an increase of 13.2% in 2004. Our sales increase was driven by the Racks merchandise mix, especially our ability to offer customers branded merchandise. Nordstrom Directs 2005 sales, including shipping revenue, increased by 1.1%. Online store sales had a double digit increase. In February 2005, we reduced our shipping fees, which drove additional online sales but reduced our overall shipping revenue. As part of the multi channel strategy (see page 6), we reduced our Direct catalog mailings significantly beginning in July 2005 and we shifted the merchandise offering to be more aligned with the Full Line stores. The decrease in the number of Direct catalog mailings, along with a continuing shift of catalog customers to our online store, resulted in a drop in catalog sales in 2005. Total net sales also increased as a result of our same store sales increases as well as from the six Full Line stores opened since February 2004. 2007 FORECAST OF SAME STORE SALES In 2007, we plan to open three Full Line stores and one Rack store, increasing retail square footage by approximately 2.4%. We are assuming low single digit same store sales growth in our Full Line and Rack stores, with a higher growth rate for Nordstrom Direct. In total, we expect 2007 same store sales to increase 3% to 4%. Nordstrom, Inc. and subsidiaries 15 Table of Contents Gross Profit (Dollars in Millions Except Per Square Foot Amounts) Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Gross profit $3,206.7 $2,834.8 $2,572.0 Gross profit rate 37.5% 36.7% 36.1% Average inventory per square foot $52.37 $51.25 $52.46 Inventory turnover rate* 5.06 4.84 4.51 * Inventory turnover rate calculated as 5 quarter average inventory divided by annual cost of sales. 2006 VS 2005 GROSS PROFIT Our gross profit rate improved 75 basis points, driven primarily by expansion of our merchandise margin rate. All major merchandise categories contributed to this rate expansion, in part due to an increase of regular price merchandise sales. Our womens apparel category experienced significant rate expansion in the second half of the year due to strategy changes that brought a sharper focus to our merchandise offering. For the first time, this year our buying and occupancy costs included expenses related to stock options awarded primarily to our merchant and product development groups. These costs were $11.9 and impacted our gross profit rate by 14 basis points. Despite this additional expense, we leveraged our buying and occupancy costs on sales growth. Sales growth and continued inventory discipline resulted in improvement in our inventory turnover rate, which increased 4.5%. 2005 VS 2004 GROSS PROFIT While we showed growth in our same store sales in 2005, we held buying and occupancy costs relatively consistent with 2004. In addition, our merchandise costs increased in line with our sales increases. As a result, we drove a gross profit rate improvement of 60 basis points. Our inventory turnover rate improved 7.3% in 2005, indicating that our merchandise planning and execution have continued to improve. 2007 FORECAST OF GROSS PROFIT In 2007, if we achieve our planned same store sales growth, we expect a net 30 to 40 basis point improvement in our gross profit rate from continued sales leverage on buying and occupancy costs along with improved merchandise margin. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (Dollars in Millions) Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Selling, general and administrative expenses $2,296.9 $2,100.7 $2,020.2 Selling, general and administrative rate 26.8% 27.2% 28.3% 2006 VS 2005 SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES We expect our selling, general and administrative rate to decrease when sales increase as we gain leverage on our fixed overhead costs. This rate decreased in 2006, but the decrease was less than the 2005 improvement. In 2005, our selling, general, and administrative rate was reduced by 24 basis points for favorable developments in our workers compensation reserve. In 2006, our selling, general and administrative rate was unfavorably impacted by 20 basis points for new stock option expenses from the adoption of Statement No. 123(R), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)). 2005 VS 2004 SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES The primary component of our selling, general and administrative expenses that varies with our same store sales is our selling costs. Most of our other expenses do not fluctuate with changes in our same store sales. In 2005, as our same store sales increased 6.0%, our general and administrative expenses were essentially in line with 2004 and we benefited from a favorable adjustment to our workers compensation reserve. These factors combined to give us a 110 basis point decrease in our selling, general and administrative rate. 2007 FORECAST OF SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES In 2007, our selling, general and administrative rate is expected to increase by 5 to 15 basis points due to the impact of an upcoming securitization transaction (see Off Balance Sheet Financing on page 21) and incremental new store pre opening costs (see Investing Activities on page 20). These two factors, which are expected to increase our selling, general and administrative expenses by $37 to $47, or 45 to 55 basis points, will offset the expected 35 to 45 basis points of rate improvement from additional sales leverage on fixed overhead costs. 16 Table of Contents Interest Expense, Net (Dollars in Millions) Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Interest expense, net $42.8 $45.3 $77.4 2006 VS 2005 INTEREST EXPENSE, NET Interest expense, net decreased $2.5 in 2006 compared to 2005. The decrease is primarily due to increased interest income from higher average cash investment balances. 2005 VS 2004 INTEREST EXPENSE, NET Interest expense, net decreased $32.1 in 2005 compared to 2004. The decrease is primarily due to debt prepayment costs of $20.9 incurred in 2004 in connection with a $198.2 debt buyback. We did not incur similar costs in 2005. 2007 FORECAST OF INTEREST EXPENSE, NET We expect interest expense, net to be flat in 2007 due to the upcoming securitization transaction (see Off Balance Sheet Financing on page 21). Other Income Including Finance Charges, Net (Dollars in Millions) Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Other income including finance charges, net $238.5 $196.4 $172.9 Other income including finance charges, net as a percentage of net sales 2.8% 2.5% 2.4% 2006 VS 2005 OTHER INCOME INCLUDING FINANCE CHARGES, NET Other income including finance charges, net increased $42.2, primarily due to growth in the co branded VISA credit card program. The principal balances of receivables in the VISA credit card, which are held by a separate trust in which we hold a certificated interest, increased 22.9% during 2006. The receivables growth increase produces an increase in the trusts earnings and our income. In addition, income from finance charges on our private label card has increased due to program growth. In July 2006, we received $5.6 of proceeds from the VISA Check/Master Money Antitrust Litigation. These proceeds were recorded as a gain in the second quarter of 2006 in other income including finance charges, net. 2005 VS 2004 OTHER INCOME INCLUDING FINANCE CHARGES, NET Other income including finance charges, net increased $23.4, due to earnings growth in the Nordstrom fsb co branded VISA credit card program and our gift card breakage income of $8.0. The principal balances of receivables in the VISA credit card, which are held by a separate trust in which we hold a certificated interest, increased 20.6% during 2005. Gift card breakage income was a new component of income in 2005. Unclaimed property legislation changed in 2004 to allow us to retain unused balances on gift cards. We analyzed the experience of our program since it was introduced in 1999, and we determined that balances remaining on cards issued five years ago are unlikely to be redeemed. The breakage income recognized in 2005 includes $2.6 and $5.4 for cards issued in 1999 and 2000. Breakage income is approximately 3.5% of the amount of initially issued gift cards. 2007 FORECAST OF OTHER INCOME INCLUDING FINANCE CHARGES, NET In 2007, other income including finance charges, net is expected to increase approximately $25.0 to $35.0. The co branded VISA receivables will be recorded on the balance sheet initially at fair value with no allowance for credit losses. Normal write offs for uncollectible VISA receivables, estimated at $19 along with other costs net at $4, will be recorded in other income including finance charges, net over the eight month period following the transaction. Nordstrom, Inc. and subsidiaries 17 Table of Contents Income Tax Expense (Dollars in Millions) Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Income tax expense $427.7 $333.9 $253.8 Effective tax rate 38.7% 37.7% 39.2% 2006 VS 2005 INCOME TAX EXPENSE Our expected effective tax rate, considering the federal tax rate of 35.0% and the net effect of state income taxes, is 38.5%. Our actual effective tax rate was slightly higher than our expected rate because our estimates of the taxes due for prior years increased based on recent developments. 2005 VS 2004 INCOME TAX EXPENSE In 2005, our actual effective tax rate was below our expected 38.5% because our 2004 tax expense, which was finalized in the third quarter of 2005, was less than we planned; we reduced our reserve when the audits of our 2000 and 2001 federal tax returns were completed; and, we utilized a larger than previously estimated amount of our capital loss carryforward. 2007 FORECAST OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE In 2007, we expect our effective tax rate to be 38.5%. Net Earnings and Earnings per Diluted Share (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Net earnings $678.0 $551.3 $393.5 Net earnings as a percentage of net sales 7.9% 7.1% 5.5% Earnings per diluted share $2.55 $1.98 $1.38 2006 VS 2005 NET EARNINGS AND EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE Our 7.5% same store sales increase combined with gross profit rate improvement and sales leverage on selling, general and administrative expenses drove net earnings of $678.0 and earnings per diluted share of $2.55. During the year, we repurchased 16.5 million shares of our common stock, favorably impacting earnings per diluted share by $0.10. The 53rd week contributed $0.02 to earnings per diluted share. 2005 VS 2004 NET EARNINGS AND EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE In 2005, net earnings increased 40.1% and earnings per diluted share increased 43.5% as a result of our same store sales growth and sales leverage on buying and occupancy and general and administrative expenses. In 2004, we incurred prepayment costs and wrote off deferred debt costs totaling $20.9, or $0.05 per diluted share, upon prepayment of $198.2 of long term debt. We did not incur similar costs in 2005. 2007 FORECAST OF EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE We expect our earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.78 to $2.84 in 2007. The securitization transaction is expected to impact earnings per diluted share by $0.05 and the incremental pre opening costs for new stores are expected to impact earnings per diluted share by $0.03. Fourth Quarter Results (Dollars in Millions) Net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2006 were $232.3 compared with $190.4 in 2005. Total sales for the quarter increased 14.6% to $2,630.9 and same store sales increased by 8.3%. Sales in the 53rd week of $117.7 represented 5.1% of the total percentage increase versus the prior year. Strong regular price sales across all major merchandise categories throughout the quarter and a successful holiday season resulted in same store sales growth above our overall sales plan. Our designer apparel, accessories, mens apparel, and cosmetics merchandise categories experienced the largest same store sales increases. As it did in the third quarter, our womens apparel category had a mid single digit increase. Our gross profit rate increased to 38.3% from 37.5% last year. Merchandise margin improved versus the prior year, driven mainly by lower markdowns and higher sell through of inventory, especially in womens apparel. Our selling, general and administrative rate improved 20 basis points from 26.2% to 26.0%. Overall, expenses during the fourth quarter trended in line with the improved performance in sales and gross profit compared to last year. Performance based incentive compensation costs driven by goals for total year results and share price appreciation accelerated above plan, as fiscal 2006 sales, gross profit, and earnings before income tax expense results exceeded our plan. 18 Table of Contents Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) (Non GAAP financial measure) (Dollars in Millions) In the past two years, we have incorporated Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) into our key financial metrics, and since 2005 have used it as an executive incentive measure. Overall performance as measured by ROIC correlates directly to shareholders return over the long term. For the 12 fiscal months ended February 3, 2007, we improved our ROIC to 20.9% compared to 16.9% for the 12 months ended January 28, 2006. Our ROIC improved primarily from increased earnings before interest and taxes. See our GAAP ROIC reconciliation below. The closest GAAP measure is return on assets, which improved to 14.0% from 11.5% for the last 12 months ended February 3, 2007 compared to the 12 months ended January 28, 2006. We define ROIC as follows: ROIC Net Operating Profit after Taxes (NOPAT) Average Invested Capital Numerator NOPAT Denominator Average Invested Capital Net earnings Average total assets Income tax expense average non interest bearing current liabilities Interest expense, net average deferred property incentives EBIT average estimated asset base of capitalized operating leases Rent expense Average invested capital Estimated depreciation on capitalized operating leases Net operating profit Estimated income tax expense NOPAT 12 fiscal months ended February 3, 2007 January 28, 2006 Net earnings $678.0 $551.3 Add: income tax expense 427.7 333.9 Add: interest expense, net 42.7 45.3 Earnings before interest and income tax expense 1,148.4 930.5 Add: rent expense 47.6 41.5 Less: estimated depreciation on capitalized operating leases1 (25.4 ) (22.1 ) Net operating profit 1,170.6 949.9 Estimated income tax expense (452.4 ) (358.7 ) Net operating profit after taxes $718.2 $591.2 Average total assets2 $4,854.1 $4,800.7 Less: average non interest bearing current liabilities3 (1,424.0 ) (1,320.6 ) Less: average deferred property incentives2 (357.9 ) (364.5 ) Add: average estimated asset base of capitalized operating leases4 361.6 384.7 Average invested capital $3,433.8 $3,500.3 Return on assets 14.0% 11.5% ROIC 20.9% 16.9% 1 Depreciation based upon estimated asset base of capitalized operating leases as described in Note 4 below. 2 Based upon the trailing 12 month average. 3 Based upon the trailing 12 month average for accounts payable, accrued salaries, wages and related benefits, other current liabilities and income taxes payable. 4 Based upon the trailing 12 month average of the monthly asset base which is calculated as the trailing 12 months rent expense multiplied by 8. Nordstrom, Inc. and subsidiaries 19 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (Dollars in Millions) Overall, cash decreased by $60.1 to $402.6 as of February 3, 2007. Over the course of the year, we sold $350.0 of our interest in the co branded VISA receivables primarily to retire $300.0 of debt, and we repurchased $621.5 worth of stock. Our strong cash flow and low debt levels place us in a position of flexibility to support our value growth plan. Operating Activities (Dollars in Millions) 2006 VS 2005 OPERATING ACTIVITIES Net cash flow from operating activities increased from $776.2 to $1,142.4, an increase of $366.2 primarily because we reduced our investment in asset backed securities by $350.0 to fund the repayment of $300.0 of private label securitization debt. Also, we were successful in expanding our private label charge card and co branded Nordstrom VISA credit card programs, which increased our investment in these programs but provided increased earnings. 2005 VS 2004 OPERATING ACTIVITIES Net cash flow from operating activities increased from $606.3 to $776.2, an increase of $169.9 primarily due to the growth in our net earnings. Our co branded VISA credit card program continued to grow in 2005 as we increased the capital we allocate to fund this program. Under our co branded VISA program, we earn interchange and finance charge income and we offer card holders merchandise certificates, which can be redeemed in our stores, similar to a gift certificate. In the course of negotiating for store locations, some developers offer up front cash payments to defray our capital expenditures in exchange for our commitment to operate a store in their development. In 2005, we received incentives totaling $49.5, which is an increase of $29.6 over 2004. Property incentive receipts vary year to year, depending on the number of our store openings and remodels and the arrangements we negotiate with developers. 2007 FORECAST FOR OPERATING ACTIVITIES In 2007, we will move the co branded VISA receivables onto our balance sheet as part of the securitization transition (see Off Balance Sheet Financing on page 21). We expect operating cash flows to decrease due to this change and receivable growth. Increased net earnings are expected to partially offset this decrease. Investing Activities (Dollars in Millions) In the past three years, we have had two principal types of investing activities: capital expenditures and short term investments. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Our annual capital expenditures ranged from $246.9 to $271.7 between 2004 and 2006. The largest components of these expenditures were for new or relocated stores and store remodels. In 2006 we opened one Full Line store at The Gardens Mall in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, we relocated our Topanga store in Canoga Park, California and we opened one Rack store at Grand Plaza in San Marcos, California. Together these openings increased our gross square footage approximately 1.2%. Our total square footage as of February 3, 2007 was 20.2 million. In 2006, 35% of our capital expenditures were for new or relocated stores, 32% were for major remodels and 7% were for minor remodels. In addition, 13% of our capital expenditures were for information technology and 13% were for other projects. Our capital expenditures over the last three years totaled $782.9. These capital expenditures were offset by property incentives of $100.0. With these capital expenditures, we added stores, enhanced existing facilities and improved our information systems. More than 1.0 million square feet of retail store space have been added during this period, representing an increase of 5.4% since January 31, 2004. We expect that our capital expenditures will be approximately $2,800.0 over the next five years, with $520.0 to $540.0 planned for 2007. We plan to use 52% of this investment to build new stores, 27% on remodels, 9% on information technology and 12% for minor remodels and other projects. Compared to the previous five years, capital expenditures will increase 138%, with increased spending allocated to new stores. Our current strategy calls for a 4% to 5% annual increase in square footage growth, with 26 new or relocated stores announced through 2011; over half of these stores will be in our Northeast and Midwest regions. The estimated capital project spending does not include potential investments in new stores resulting from the current industry consolidation. We believe we have the capacity to address additional capital investments should opportunities arise. In the second half of 2007, we expect to open three new Full Line stores and one Rack store, and in the first quarter of 2008, we expect to open four new Full Line stores. We typically incur the majority of our pre opening costs in the six months prior to opening. In 2007, new store pre opening costs, which will be recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, are expected to impact our earnings per diluted share by $0.03. As of February 3, 2007, we were contractually committed to spend $32.2 for constructing new stores, remodeling existing stores, and other capital projects. SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS In 2006, we sold our short term investments and primarily used the proceeds for common stock repurchases. 20 Table of Contents Financing Activities (Dollars in Millions) Over the past three years, our net operating cash inflows have exceeded our net investing cash outflows, and we used this excess cash flow to repay long term debt, pay dividends, and to repurchase our common stock. Over this three year period, the price of our common stock has increased, which spurred stock option exercises that also increased our net cash. DEBT RETIREMENT The following table outlines our debt retirement activity: Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Principal repaid or retired: Private Label Securitization, 4.82%, due 2006 $300.0 Senior notes, 8.95%, due 2005 $196.8 Notes payable, 6.7%, due 2005 $96.0 $1.5 Total $300.0 $96.0 $198.3 Total cash payment $300.0 $96.0 $220.1 We retired the $300.0, 4.82% Private Label Securitization debt when it matured in October 2006. We repaid the remaining $96.0 of our 6.7% medium term notes when they matured in 2005. The cash payments in 2004 that exceeded the principal retired represent early prepayment premiums. SHARE REPURCHASE In August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized $300.0 of share repurchases, replacing a previous share repurchase authorization. By the end of 2004, we purchased 13.8 million shares in the open market for the entire authorized amount of $300.0 at an average price of $21.71 per share. In February 2005, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $500.0 of share repurchases. Overall for 2005, we purchased 8.5 million shares for $287.1 at an average price of $33.80 per share. We utilized the remaining authorization of $212.9 in February and March of 2006, purchasing 5.4 million shares at an average price of $39.27 per share. Our Board of Directors authorized an additional $1,000.0 of share repurchases in May 2006. During the remainder of the year we repurchased 11.1 million shares for $408.6 at an average price of $36.74. As of February 3, 2007 the unused authorization was $591.4. The actual amount and timing of future share repurchases will be subject to market conditions and applicable SEC rules. Debt to Capital Ratio Our recent favorable operating results increased our shareholders equity and allowed us to reduce our long term debt, which contributed to a decrease in our debt to capital ratio from 36.5% at the end of 2004 to 22.5% at the end of 2006. In the third quarter of 2006, we repaid $300.0 of long term debt by selling a portion of our interest in the co branded Nordstrom VISA receivable trust. This arrangement put us below our target debt to capital range of 25% to 40%. In the first quarter of 2007, we will be increasing our debt and asset levels as a result of a new co branded Nordstrom VISA securitization transaction. Both the co branded Nordstrom VISA receivables and the debt backed by those receivables will be recorded on our balance sheet. In anticipation of this new securitization structure, we are adjusting our target debt to capital ratio range to 30% to 45% going forward. Off Balance Sheet Financing (Dollars in Millions) Through our wholly owned federal savings bank, Nordstrom fsb, we offer a private label charge card and two co branded Nordstrom VISA credit cards. The private label charge card receivables are held in a trust, which may issue third party debt that is securitized by the private label receivables; the private label program is treated as on balance sheet, with the receivables, net of bad debt allowance, and debt, if any, recorded on our balance sheet, the finance charge income recorded in other income including finance charges, net, and the bad debt expense recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. The co branded Nordstrom VISA credit card receivables are held in a separate trust (the VISA Trust), which may issue third party debt that is securitized by the co branded Nordstrom VISA credit card receivables. The co branded Nordstrom VISA credit card program is treated as off balance sheet. We record the fair value of our interest in the VISA Trust on our balance sheet, gains on the sale of receivables to the VISA Trust and our share of the VISA Trusts finance income in other income including finance charges, net. As of February 3, 2007, the VISA Trust had co branded Nordstrom VISA credit card receivables with a total face amount of $908.0 and had outstanding two series of notes held by third parties: $200.0 of 2002 Class AB notes that mature in April 2007, and $350.0 of 2004 2 variable funding notes that may be renewed in August 2007. In fiscal 2006, the co branded Nordstrom VISA credit card receivables had an average gross yield of 16.8% and average annual credit losses of 2.8%. The weighted average interest rate on the third party notes was 5.3%. Following the repayment of the VISA Trusts $200.0 notes in April 2007, we plan to merge the private label charge card and co branded VISA programs into one securitization program. The advantage of a combined program is that it will provide us with greater borrowing flexibility as we will be able to borrow funds based on the outstanding balance of the combined receivables, it will lower our administrative costs, and will give us one method of accounting for these similar programs on balance sheet. When we combine these programs, we plan to also increase our borrowing against these combined receivables to a range of $800.0 to $900.0. Nordstrom, Inc. and subsidiaries 21 Table of Contents In the first quarter, the VISA Trust requires that cash receipts be used to establish a pre funding account to repay the 2002 AB Notes; this pre funding balance reduces the overall yield in the VISA Trust, which is expected to reduce our earnings by $7.0. After we combine the securitization programs in April 2007, our investment in the VISA Trust will be reclassified from available for sale securities to receivables, at fair value with no allowance for credit losses. Based on past payment patterns, these receivables will be repaid within eight months. During that time, we expect to record incremental bad debt write offs and certain finance charge income as an adjustment to the fair value of the receivables acquired, reducing the yield of these receivables; these costs are expected to be $16.0 and will be recorded over the eight month repayment period. Following the recognition of the $7.0 yield reduction in the first quarter and the $16.0 of other adjustments through the remainder of 2007, the private label charge card receivables and the co branded VISA credit card receivables will be recorded at historical cost, net of bad debt allowances, on our balance sheet. As card holders continue to use their co branded VISA credit cards, new receivables will be recorded. Those new receivables will be recorded at historical cost; as those receivables age, we will establish an allowance for bad debts based on historical write off experience. We expect to record $25.0 to $35.0 of bad debt provision in selling, general and administrative expenses from these new receivables. The classification of this expense is different because these receivables are on balance sheet, in the past, the write off experience was considered in our investment yield and reflected in other income including finance charges, net. We do not expect the co branded VISA credit card receivable write off experience to be impacted by the transition in the accounting treatment, only the classification of this expense will change. As noted above, all debt issued by the combined trust will be recorded on our balance sheet, so the related interest expense will be recorded in interest expense, net. Currently, the interest expense of the debt issued by the VISA Trust reduces our overall yield from our investment and is recognized in other income including finance charges, net. With the bad debt and interest expense impacts shifting out of other income including finance charges, net, we expect our other income line item on our earnings statement to increase by $45.0 to $55.0. We expect our earnings before income tax expense to be reduced by $23.0, or $0.05 per diluted share, for the transition from fair value to historical cost. The other earnings statement classification changes associated with the accounting treatment for the combined securitization program are not expected to impact our earnings before income tax expense. In the future, our ROIC rate will be reduced because we will recognize additional invested capital from the securitization program transition. Interest Rate Swaps (Dollars in Millions) To manage our interest rate risk, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in 2003, which had a $250.0 notional amount expiring in January 2009. Under the agreement, we receive a fixed rate of 5.63% and pay a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a margin of 2.3% set at six month intervals (7.70% at February 3, 2007). The interest rate swap agreement had a fair value of $(8.9) and $(11.1) at the end of 2006 and 2005. Contractual Obligations (Dollars in Millions) The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and the expected effect on our liquidity and cash flows as of February 3, 2007. We expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business and credit available to us under existing and potential future facilities. Less than More than Total 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years 5 years Long term debt $630.9 $5.9 $262.3 $9.9 $352.8 Capital lease obligations 13.5 1.9 3.3 2.4 5.9 Other long term liabilities 222.3 30.8 40.3 20.2 131.0 Operating leases 650.2 78.0 148.1 130.5 293.6 Purchase obligations 1,070.0 1,056.1 12.7 1.0 0.2 Total $2,586.9 $1,172.7 $466.7 $164.0 $783.5 In addition to the required debt repayments disclosed above, we estimate total interest payments of approximately $512.6 as of February 3, 2007, payable over the remaining life of the debts. Other long term liabilities consist of workers compensation and general liability insurance reserves and postretirement benefits. The repayment amounts presented above were determined based on historical payment trends. Other long term liabilities not requiring cash payments, such as deferred property incentives, were excluded from the table above. Purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for unreceived goods or services and capital expenditure commitments. This table also excludes the short term liabilities, other than the current portion of long term debt, disclosed on our 2006 balance sheet, as the amounts recorded for these items will be paid in the next year. Long term debt excludes debt issued by the VISA Trust, including $200.0 off balance sheet receivable backed securities due in April 2007 and $350.0 variable funding note that can be renewed in August 2007. 22 Table of Contents Credit Capacity and Commitments (Dollars in Millions) The following table summarizes our amount of commitment expiration per period: Total Amounts Less than More than Committed 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years 5 years Other commercial commitments $600.0 variable funding note $350.0 $350.0 $500.0 unsecured line of credit, none outstanding Standby letters of credit Import letters of credit 9.8 9.8 Total $359.8 $359.8 In June and October 2006, we amended our existing variable funding facility backed by Nordstrom private label card and VISA credit card receivables to increase the capacity of this facility to $600.0. Borrowings under the facility will incur interest based upon the actual cost of commercial paper plus specified fees ranging from 0.075% to 0.15%. As of February 3, 2007, the facilitys interest rate was 5.42%. We pay a commitment fee ranging from 0.125% to 0.15% for the note based on the amount of the commitment. Fee rates decrease if more than $50,000 is outstanding on the facility. The facility can be cancelled or not renewed if our debt ratings fall below Standard and Poors BB rating or Moodys Ba1 rating. In November 2005, we replaced our existing $350.0 unsecured line of credit with a $500.0 unsecured line of credit, which is available as liquidity support for our commercial paper program. Under the terms of the agreement, we pay a variable rate of interest and a commitment fee based on our debt rating. Based upon our current debt rating, we pay a variable rate of interest of LIBOR plus a margin of 0.225% (5.62% at February 3, 2007) on the outstanding balance and an annual commitment fee of 0.075% on the total capacity. The variable rate of interest increases to LIBOR plus a margin of 0.325% if more than $250.0 is outstanding on the facility. The line of credit expires in November 2010, and contains restrictive covenants, which include maintaining a leverage ratio. We did not make any borrowings under this unsecured line of credit during the last three fiscal years. We also have universal shelf registrations on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to offer an additional $450.0 of securities to the public. These registration statements allow us to issue various types of securities, including debt, common stock, warrants to purchase common stock, warrants to purchase debt securities and warrants to purchase or sell foreign currency. Debt Ratings The following table shows our credit ratings at the date of this report: Standard Credit Ratings Moodys and Poors Senior unsecured debt Baa1 A Commercial paper P 2 A 1 Outlook Positive Stable These ratings could change depending on our performance and other factors. Our outstanding debt is not subject to termination or interest rate adjustments based on changes in our credit ratings. Dividends In February 2007 we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.135 per share, increased from $0.105 per share in the prior year. In 2006, we paid dividends of $0.42 per share, the tenth consecutive year that our annual dividends increased. We paid dividends of $0.32 and $0.24 in 2005 and 2004. In determining the amount of dividends to pay, we analyze our dividend payout ratio, dividend yield and balance the dividend payment with our operating performance and capital resources. We target a dividend payout ratio of approximately 18% to 20% of net income, although the ratio has been slightly lower the last two years as a result of the significant increase in our net earnings. For the dividend yield, which is calculated as our dividends per share divided by our stock price, we target a 1% long term yield. While we plan to increase dividends over time, we will balance future increases with our operating performance and available capital resources. Liquidity We maintain a level of liquidity to allow us to cover our seasonal cash needs and to minimize our need for short term borrowings. We believe that our operating cash flows, existing cash and available credit facilities are sufficient to finance our cash requirements for the next 12 months. Over the long term, we manage our cash and capital structure to maximize shareholder return, strengthen our financial position and maintain flexibility for future strategic initiatives. We continuously assess our debt and leverage levels, capital expenditure requirements, principal debt payments, dividend payouts, potential share repurchases and future investments or acquisitions. We believe our operating cash flows, existing cash and available credit facilities, as well as any potential future borrowing facilities, will be sufficient to fund these scheduled future payments and potential long term initiatives. Nordstrom, Inc. and subsidiaries 23 Table of Contents In 2000, the company acquired Faonnable, S.A.S., a collection of high quality mens, womens and boys apparel and accessories. In February 2007, we announced that we are exploring strategic options that would benefit both Nordstrom and Faonnable, including a possible sale of the brand. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The following discussion highlights the policies we feel are critical. Off Balance Sheet Financing Our co branded Nordstrom VISA credit card receivables are transferred to a third party trust on a daily basis. The balance of the receivables transferred to the trust fluctuates as new receivables are generated and old receivables are retired (through payments received, charge offs, or credits from merchandise returns). The trust issues securities that are backed by the receivables. Certain of these securities or beneficial interests are sold to third party investors and those remaining securities are issued to us. We recognize gains or losses on the sale of the co branded Nordstrom VISA receivables to the trust based on the difference between the face value of the receivables sold and the estimated fair value of the assets created in the securitization process. The fair value of the assets is calculated as the present value of their expected cash flows. The discount rate used to calculate fair value represents the volatility and risk of the assets. Assumptions and judgments are made to estimate the fair value of our investment in asset backed securities. We have no other off balance sheet transactions. Inventory Our merchandise inventories are primarily stated at the lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method (first in, first out basis). Under the retail method, the valuation of inventories and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of ending inventory. To determine if the retail value of our inventory should be marked down, we consider current and anticipated demand, customer preferences, age of the merchandise and fashion trends. As our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. We also reserve for obsolescence based on historical trends and specific identification. Shrinkage is estimated as a percentage of net sales for the period from the most recent semi annual inventory count based on historical shrinkage results. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenues net of estimated returns and we exclude sales taxes. Our retail stores record revenue at the point of sale. Our catalog and online sales include shipping revenue and are recorded upon estimated delivery to the customer. As part of the normal sales cycle, we receive customer merchandise returns. To recognize the financial impact of sales returns, we estimate the amount of goods that will be returned and reduce sales and cost of sales accordingly. We utilize historical return patterns to estimate our expected returns. Vendor Allowances We receive allowances from merchandise vendors for purchase price adjustments, cooperative advertising programs, cosmetic selling expenses and vendor sponsored contests. Purchase price adjustments are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales after an agreement with the vendor is executed and the related merchandise has been sold. Allowances for cooperative advertising programs and vendor sponsored contests are recorded in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses as a reduction to the related cost when incurred. Allowances for cosmetic selling expenses are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses as a reduction to the related cost when incurred. Any allowances in excess of actual costs are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales. Self Insurance We retain a portion of the risk for certain losses related to health and welfare, workers compensation and general liability claims. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both losses reported and losses incurred but not yet reported. We estimate our ultimate cost based on internal analysis of historical data and independent actuarial estimates. Favorable trends in California caused a decrease in our workers compensation costs in 2005. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Our allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of the losses inherent in our private label credit card receivable as of the balance sheet date. We evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on several factors, including historical trends of aging of accounts, write off experience and expectations of future performance. We recognize finance charges on delinquent accounts until the account is written off. Delinquent accounts are written off when they are determined to be uncollectible, usually after the passage of 151 days without receiving a full scheduled monthly payment. Accounts are written off sooner in the event of customer bankruptcy or other circumstances that make further collection unlikely. Intangible Asset Impairment Testing We review our goodwill and acquired tradename annually for impairment in the first quarter or when circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. The goodwill and acquired tradename associated with our Faonnable business are our largest impairment risk. The fair value of our intangible assets has exceeded their carrying value in each of the most recent three years. 24 Table of Contents Leases We lease the land or the land and building at many of our Full Line stores, and we lease the building at many of our Rack stores. Additionally, we lease office facilities, warehouses and equipment. We recognize lease expense on a straight line basis over the minimum lease term. In 2004, we corrected our lease accounting policy to recognize lease expense, net of property incentives, from the time that we control the leased property. We recorded a charge of $7.8 ($4.7 net of tax) in the fourth quarter of 2004 to correct this accounting policy. The impact of this change was immaterial to prior periods. Many of our leases include options that allow us to extend the lease term beyond the initial commitment period, subject to terms agreed to at lease inception. For leases that contain rent holiday periods and scheduled rent increases, we record the difference between the rent expense and the rental amount payable under the leases in liabilities. Some leases require additional payments based on sales and are recorded in rent expense when the contingent rent is probable. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), which requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, accounting for income taxes in interim periods, and income tax disclosures. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective for us as of the beginning of our 2007 fiscal year. We will adopt FIN 48 in the first quarter of 2007, as required. We continue to evaluate the impact of adoption, but expect that it will not be material. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are assessing the potential impact on our financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. INTEREST RATE RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates. In seeking to minimize risk, we manage exposure through our regular operating and financing activities. We do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and are not party to any leveraged financial instruments. Interest rate exposure is managed through our mix of fixed and variable rate borrowings. Short term borrowing and investing activities generally bear interest at variable rates, but because they have maturities of three months or less, we believe that the risk of material loss was low, and that the carrying amount approximated fair value. The table below presents information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, which consist of debt obligations and interest rate swaps for the year ended February 3, 2007. For debt obligations, the table presents principal amounts, at book value, by maturity date, and related weighted average interest rates. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected (contractual) maturity dates. Notional amounts are the predetermined dollar principal on which the exchanged interest payments are based. Total at Fair value at February 3, February 3, Dollars in thousands 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter 2007 2007 Long term debt Fixed $6,800 $257,030 $7,043 $5,427 $5,764 $357,244 $639,308 $667,191 Avg. int. rate 8.0% 5.7% 7.7% 8.9% 8.7% 7.1% 6.6% Interest rate swap Fixed to variable $250,000 $250,000 $(8,858 ) Avg. pay rate 7.70% 7.70% Avg. receive rate 5.63% 5.63% FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK The majority of our revenue, expense and capital expenditures are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, we periodically enter into foreign currency purchase orders denominated in Euros for apparel, accessories and shoes. We use forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices. We do not believe the fair value of our outstanding forward contracts at February 3, 2007 to be material. In addition, the functional currency of Faonnable, S.A.S. of Nice, France is the Euro. Assets and liabilities of Faonnable are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing at the end of the period. Income and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars at an average exchange rate during the period. Foreign currency gains and losses from the translation of Faonnables balance sheet and income statement are included in other comprehensive earnings. Foreign currency gains or losses from certain intercompany loans are recorded in other income including finance charges, net. Nordstrom, Inc. and subsidiaries 25 Table of Contents
