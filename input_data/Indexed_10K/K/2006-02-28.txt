Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Kellogg Company and Subsidiaries Results Of Operations Overview Kellogg Company is the worlds leading producer of cereal and a leading producer of convenience foods, including cookies, crackers, toaster pastries, cereal bars, frozen waffles, and meat alternatives. Kellogg products are manufactured and marketed globally. We currently manage our operations based on the geographic regions of North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia Pacific. This organizational structure is the basis of the operating segment data presented in this report. We manage our Company for sustainable performance defined by our long term annual growth targets of low single digit for internal net sales, mid single digit for internal operating profit, and high single digit for net earnings per share. (Our measure of internal growth excludes the impact of currency and, if applicable, acquisitions, dispositions, and shipping day differences.) In combination with an attractive dividend yield, we believe this profitable growth will provide strong total return to our shareholders. We plan to continue to achieve this sustainability through a strategy focused on growing our cereal business, expanding our snacks business, and pursuing selected growth opportunities. We support our business strategy with operating principles that emphasize sales dollars over shipment volume (Volume to Value), as well as cash flow and return on invested capital (Manage for Cash). We believe the success of our strategy and operating principles are reflected in our steady growth in earnings and strong cash flow over the past several years. This performance has been achieved despite significant challenges such as rising commodity, fuel, energy, and employee benefit costs, as well as increased investment in brand building, innovation, and cost reduction initiatives. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company reported diluted net earnings per share of $2.36, a 10% increase over fiscal 2004 results. Consolidated net sales grew approximately 6%, operating profit increased 4%, and net earnings were up 10%. For the year ended January 1, 2005, net earnings per share were $2.14, an 11% increase over fiscal 2003 net earnings per share of $1.92. For 2005, net cash provided from operating activities was $1,143.3 million and included nearly $200 million of incremental benefit plan funding, as compared to the 2004 amount of $1,229.0 million.

Refer to Note 1 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 11 Table of Contents During 2005, consolidated net sales increased nearly 6%. Internal net sales also grew approximately 6%, which was on top of 5% internal sales growth in the prior year. During the year, successful innovation and brand building investment continued to drive strong growth across our North American business units, which collectively reported a 7% increase in net sales versus 2004. Internal net sales of our North America retail cereal business increased 8%, with strong performance in both the United States and Canada. As a result, our dollar share of the U.S. ready to eat cereal category increased 40 basis points during 2005, to 33.7% as of January 1, 2006, representing the sixth consecutive year of share growth. Internal net sales of our North America retail snacks business (consisting of wholesome snacks, cookies, crackers, and toaster pastries) increased 7% on top of 8% growth in 2004. This growth was attributable principally to sales of fruit snacks, toaster pastries, cracker products, and major cookie brands. Partially offsetting this growth was the impact of proactively managing discontinuation of marginal cookie innovations. Internal net sales of our North America frozen and specialty channel (which includes food service, vending, convenience, drug stores, and custom manufacturing) businesses collectively increased approximately 8%, led by solid contributions from our Eggo frozen foods and food service businesses. Net sales in our European operating segment were approximately even with 2004, with internal net sales growth at nearly 2%. This growth was largely due to cereal and snacks sales across southern Europe, partially offset by a sales decline in our Nordics market, which resulted from a temporary delisting by a major customer. Despite intense competitive pressures on our U.K. business unit, we were able to maintain sales within this market at nearly the prior year level. Strong performance in Latin America resulted in net sales growth of nearly 15%, with internal sales growth at 11%. Most of this growth was due to strong performance by our Mexico, Venezuela, and Caribbean business units, although sales increased in virtually all the Latin American markets in which we do business. Net sales in our Asia Pacific operating segment increased approximately 3%, with internal net sales growth at 1%. This sales increase was largely due to innovation related growth in our Asian markets, partially offset by a decline in our Australian business, which was unfavorably impacted by competitive nutritional claims and timing of snack product innovation versus the prior year. In late 2005, we introduced new products and undertook health oriented initiatives which we believe will mitigate these in market factors during 2006. Consolidated operating profit increased 4% during 2005, with our European operating segment contributing approximately one half of the total dollar increase. This disproportionate contribution was attributable to a year over year shift in segment allocation of charges from cost reduction initiatives. As discussed in the section beginning on page 14, the year over year change in project cost allocation was a $65 million decline in Europe (improving 2005 segment operating profit performance by approximately 22%) and a $46 million increase in North America (reducing 2005 segment operating profit performance by approximately 4%). Internal growth in consolidated operating profit was 5%. This internal growth was achieved despite double digit growth in brand building and innovation expenditures and significant cost pressures on gross margin, as discussed in the section beginning on page 13. During 2005, we increased our consolidated brand building (advertising and consumer promotion) expenditures by more than 11/2 times the rate of sales growth. 2004 compared to 2003 The following tables provide an analysis of net sales and operating profit performance for 2004 versus 2003: North Latin Asia (dollars in millions) America Europe America Pacific(a) Corporate Consolidated 2004 net sales $ 6,369.3 $ 2,007.3 $ 718.0 $ 519.3 $ $ 9,613.9 2003 net sales $ 5,954.3 $ 1,734.2 $ 666.7 $ 456.3 $ $ 8,811.5 % change 2004 vs. 2003: Volume (tonnage) (b) 2.4% .1% 6.1% .4% 2.1% Pricing/mix 2.6% 3.7% 5.0% 2.7% 2.9% Subtotal internal business 5.0% 3.6% 11.1% 2.3% 5.0% Shipping day differences (c) 1.5% 1.0% 1.2% 1.3% Foreign currency impact .5% 11.1% 3.4% 10.3% 2.8% Total change 7.0% 15.7% 7.7% 13.8% 9.1% North Latin Asia (dollars in millions) America Europe America Pacific(a) Corporate Consolidated 2004 operating profit $ 1,240.4 $ 292.3 $ 185.4 $ 79.5 $ (116.5 ) $ 1,681.1 2003 operating profit $ 1,134.2 $ 279.8 $ 168.9 $ 61.1 $ (99.9 ) $ 1,544.1 % change 2004 vs. 2003: Internal business 6.5% 7.4% 14.1% 13.8% 16.1% 4.5% Shipping day differences (c) 2.4% 1.1% 2.8% .5% 2.0% Foreign currency impact .5% 10.8% 4.3% 13.4% 2.4% Total change 9.4% 4.5% 9.8% 30.0% 16.6% 8.9% (a) Includes Australia and Asia.

Refer to Note 1 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 12 Table of Contents During 2004, consolidated net sales increased approximately 9%. Internal net sales grew 5%, which was on top of approximately 4% growth in the prior year. During 2004, successful innovation and brand building investment continued to drive growth in most of our businesses. North America reported net sales growth of approximately 7%, with internal growth across all major product groups. Internal net sales of our North America retail cereal business increased approximately 2%, with successful innovation and consumer promotion activities supporting sales growth and category share gains in both the United States and Canada. Internal net sales of our North America retail snacks business increased 8%, with the wholesome snacks, crackers, and toaster pastries components of our snacks portfolio all contributing to that growth. While our cookie sales were essentially unchanged from the prior year, we were pleased with this performance, in light of a category decline in measured channels of approximately 4%. We believe the recovery of our snacks business this year was due primarily to successful product and packaging innovation, combined with effective execution in our direct store door (DSD) delivery system. Internal net sales of our North America frozen and specialty channel businesses collectively increased approximately 4%. Net sales in our European operating segment increased approximately 16%, with internal sales growth of nearly 4%. Both our U.K. business unit and pan European cereal business achieved internal net sales growth for the year of approximately 2%. Sales of our snack products within the region grew at a strong double digit rate. Strong performance in Latin America resulted in net sales growth of approximately 8%, with internal net sales growth of 11% more than offsetting unfavorable foreign currency movements. Most of this growth was due to very strong price/mix and tonnage improvements in both cereal and snack sales by our Mexican business unit. Net sales in our Asia Pacific operating segment increased approximately 14% due primarily to favorable foreign currency movements, with internal net sales growth at 2%. Strong internal net sales performance in Australia was partially offset by a sales decline in Asia, due primarily to the effect of negative publicity regarding sugar containing products in Korea throughout most of the year. Consolidated operating profit increased approximately 9% during 2004, with internal growth of more than 4%. This internal growth was achieved despite increased brand building expenditures and significantly higher commodity costs. Furthermore, corporate operating profit for 2004 included a charge of $9.5 million related to CEO transition expenses. Lastly, as discussed in the Cost reduction initiatives section beginning on page 14, we absorbed in operating profit significant up front costs in both 2003 and 2004, with 2004 charges exceeding 2003 charges by approximately $38 million. The CEO transition expenses arose from the departure of Carlos Gutierrez, the Companys former CEO, related to his appointment as U.S. Secretary of Commerce in early 2005. The total charge (net of forfeitures) of $9.5 million was comprised principally of $3.7 million for special pension termination benefits and $5.5 million for accelerated vesting of 606,250 stock options. Operating profit for each of fiscal 2003 and 2004 includes intangibles impairment losses of approximately $10 million. The 2003 loss was to reduce the carrying value of a contract based intangible asset and was included in North American operating profit. The 2004 loss was comprised of $7.9 million to write off the remaining value of this same contract based intangible asset in North America and $2.5 million to write off goodwill in Latin America. Margin performance Margin performance is presented in the following table. Change vs. prior year (pts.) 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 Gross margin 44.9% 44.9% 44.4% .5 SGA% (a) 27.7% 27.4% 26.9% .3 .5 Operating margin 17.2% 17.5% 17.5% .3 (a) Selling, general, and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales. Our long term goal is to achieve annual improvements in gross margin and to reinvest this growth in brand building and innovation expenditures, so as to maintain a relatively steady operating margin. Our strategy for expanding our gross margin is to manage external cost pressures through sales driven operating leverage, mix improvements, productivity savings, and technological initiatives to reduce the cost of product ingredients and packaging. In 2004, our consolidated gross margin increased by 50 basis points to 44.9%. For 2005, we were able to maintain our consolidated gross margin at this level, overcoming the impact of several significant cost factors as discussed in the following paragraphs. Supported by late 2005 price increases in various markets and pay back from prior investment, we expect to moderately expand our gross margin again in 2006. In 2005, we experienced an uncontrollable, weather related hike in fuel and energy costs during the second half of the year, while in 2004, our 13 Table of Contents commodity costs rose significantly and remained historically high throughout 2005. In summary, we believe market price inflation negatively impacted our consolidated gross margin by approximately 90 basis points in 2004 and a net 30 basis points in 2005 (60 basis points from fuel/energy partially offset by an easing in certain commodity prices). Our profitability projections for 2006 currently include a 90 100 basis point unfavorable gross margin impact from fuel, energy, and other commodity price inflation. Employee benefit costs (the majority of which is recorded in cost of goods sold) also increased for both 2004 and 2005, with total active and retired employee benefits expense reaching nearly $300 million in 2005 versus approximately $260 million in 2004 and $240 million in 2003. Our profitability projections for 2006 currently include incremental employee benefits expense of $20 $40 million. In addition to external cost pressures, our discretionary investment in cost reduction initiatives (refer to following section) has placed short term pressure on our gross margin performance during the periods presented. The portion of total program related charges recorded in cost of goods sold was (in millions): 2005 $90; 2004 $46; 2003 $67. Additionally, cost of goods sold for 2005 includes a charge of approximately $12 million, related to a lump sum payment to members of the major union representing the hourly employees at our U.S. cereal plants for ratification of a wage and benefits agreement with the Company covering the four year period ended October 2009. Cost reduction initiatives We view our continued spending on cost reduction initiatives as part of our sustainable growth model of earnings reinvestment for reliability in meeting long term growth targets. Initiatives undertaken must meet certain pay back and internal rate of return (IRR) targets. We currently require each project to recover total cash implementation costs within a five year period of completion or to achieve an IRR of at least 20%. Each cost reduction initiative is of relatively short duration (normally one year or less), and begins to deliver cash savings and or reduced depreciation during the first year of implementation, which is then used to fund new initiatives. To implement these programs, the Company has incurred various up front costs, including asset write offs, exit charges, and other project expenditures, which we include in our measure and discussion of operating segment profitability within the Net sales and operating profit section beginning on page 11. In 2005, we undertook an initiative to consolidate U.S. snacks bakery capacity, resulting in the closure of two facilities by mid 2006. Major initiatives commenced in 2004 were the global rollout of the SAP information technology system, reorganization of pan European operations, consolidation of U.S. meat alternatives manufacturing operations, and relocation of our U.S. snacks business unit to Battle Creek, Michigan. Major actions implemented in 2003 included a wholesome snack plant consolidation in Australia, manufacturing capacity rationalization in the Mercosur region of Latin America, and a plant workforce reduction in Great Britain. Additionally, during all periods presented, we have undertaken various manufacturing capacity rationalization and efficiency initiatives primarily in our North American and European operating segments, as well as the 2003 disposal of a manufacturing facility in China. Details of each initiative are described in Note 3 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Related to the aforementioned U.S. snacks bakery consolidation, we expect to incur approximately $30 million of project costs in 2006, two thirds comprised of cash costs and one third asset write offs. Other potential initiatives to be commenced in 2006 are still in the planning stages and individual actions will be announced as management commits to these discretionary investments. Our 2006 earnings target includes projected charges related to potential cost reduction initiatives of approximately $90 million or $.15 per share. Except for the portion attributable to the aforementioned U.S. snacks bakery consolidation of $30 million, the specific cash versus non cash mix or cost of goods sold versus SGA impact of the remaining $60 million has not yet been determined. For 2005, total program related charges were approximately $90 million, comprised of $16 million for a multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability, $44 million of asset write offs, and $30 million for severance and other cash expenditures. All of the charges were recorded in cost of goods sold within the Companys North American operating segment. For 2004, total program related charges were approximately $109 million, comprised of $41 million in asset write offs, $1 million for special pension termination benefits, $15 million in severance and other exit costs, and $52 million in other cash expenditures such as relocation and consulting. Approximately $46 million of the total 2004 charges were recorded in cost of goods sold, with approximately $63 million recorded in selling, general, and administrative (SGA) expense. The 2004 charges impacted our operating segments as follows (in millions): North America $44, Europe $65. For 2003, total program related charges were approximately $71 million, comprised of $40 million in asset write offs, $8 million for special pension termination benefits, and $23 million in severance and other cash exit costs. Approximately $67 million of the total 2003 charges were recorded in cost of 14 Table of Contents goods sold, with approximately $4 million recorded in SGA expense. The 2003 charges impacted our operating segments as follows (in millions): North America $36, Europe $21, Latin America $8, Asia Pacific $6. Exit cost reserves were approximately $13 million at December 31, 2005, consisting principally of severance obligations associated with projects commenced in 2005, which are expected to be paid out in 2006. At January 1, 2005, exit cost reserves were approximately $11 million, representing severance costs that were substantially paid out in 2005. Interest expense Between the acquisition of Keebler Foods Company in early 2001 and the end of 2004, our Company paid down nearly $2.0 billion of debt, even early retiring long term debt in each of the past three years. Net early retirement premiums are recorded in interest expense and were (in millions): 2005 $13; 2004 $4; 2003 $17. These premiums were or are expected to be largely recovered through lower short term interest rates over the original remaining terms of the retired debt. As a result of this debt reduction, interest expense declined significantly from 2003 to 2004, but leveled off in 2005 as we reached a near term steady state debt position by year end 2005, which is discussed further in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section on page 16. Nevertheless, based on prevailing interest rates, we currently expect 2006 interest expense to decline 4 5% from the 2005 amount, due primarily to a shift in our total debt mix from higher rate long term to lower rate short term. Change vs. (dollars in millions) prior year 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 Reported interest expense $ 300.3 $ 308.6 $ 371.4 Amounts capitalized 1.2 .9 Gross interest expense $ 301.5 $ 309.5 $ 371.4 2.6% 16.7% Other income (expense), net Other income (expense), net includes non operating items such as interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses, charitable donations, and gains on asset sales. Other income (expense) for 2005 includes charges of $16 million for contributions to the Kelloggs Corporate Citizenship Fund, a private trust established for charitable giving, and a charge of approximately $7 million to reduce the carrying value of a corporate commercial facility to estimated selling value. The carrying value of all held for sale assets at December 31, 2005, was insignificant. Other income (expense), net for 2004 includes charges of approximately $9 million for contributions to the Kelloggs Corporate Citizenship Fund. Other income (expense), net for 2003 includes credits of approximately $17 million related to favorable legal settlements, a charge of $8 million for a contribution to the Kelloggs Corporate Citizenship Fund, and a charge of $6.5 million to recognize the impairment of a cost basis investment in an e commerce business venture. Income taxes The consolidated effective income tax rate for 2005 was approximately 31%, which was below both the 2004 rate of nearly 35% and the 2003 rate of less than 33%. As compared to the prior period rates, the 2005 consolidated effective income tax rate benefited primarily from the 2004 reorganization of our European operations and to a lesser extent, from U.S. tax legislation that allows a phased in deduction from taxable income equal to a stipulated percentage of qualified production income (QPI), beginning in 2005. The resulting tax savings have been reinvested, in part, in cost reduction initiatives, brand building expenditures, and other growth initiatives. We currently expect our 2006 consolidated effective income tax rate to be 31 32%; however, this projection could be significantly affected by the implementation of tax savings initiatives currently in the planning stages, the settlement of several on going domestic and international income tax audits, or other similar discrete events within interim periods of 2006. We expect that any incremental benefits from such discrete events would be invested in cost reduction initiatives and other growth opportunities. During 2005, we elected to repatriate approximately $1.1 billion of dividends from foreign subsidiaries which qualified for the temporary dividends received deduction available under the American Jobs Creation Act. The associated net tax cost of approximately $40 million was provided for in 2004. 15 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows, supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions. This cash generating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs. The principal source of our operating cash flow is net earnings, meaning cash receipts from the sale of our products, net of costs to manufacture and market our products. Our cash conversion cycle is relatively short; although receivable collection patterns vary around the world, in the United States, our days sales outstanding (DSO) averages 18 19 days. As a result, the growth in our operating cash flow should generally reflect the growth in our net earnings over time. As presented in the schedule to the right, operating cash flow performance for 2004 generally reflects this principle, except for the level of benefit plan contributions and working capital movements (operating assets and liabilities). In addition to these two variables, operating cash flow performance for 2005 further deviates from this pattern due principally to the significant portion of net earnings growth for the year attributable to non cash deferred income tax benefits. (dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Operating activities Net earnings $ 980.4 $ 890.6 $ 787.1 year over year change 10.1 % 13.1 % Items in net earnings not requiring (providing) cash: Depreciation and amortization 391.8 410.0 372.8 Deferred income taxes (59.2 ) 57.7 74.8 Other (a) 199.3 104.5 76.1 Net earnings after non cash items 1,512.3 1,462.8 1,310.8 year over year change 3.4 % 11.6 % Pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions (397.3 ) (204.0 ) (184.2 ) Changes in operating assets and liabilities: Core working capital (b) 45.4 46.0 (.1 ) Other working capital (17.1 ) (75.8 ) 44.5 Total 28.3 (29.8 ) 44.4 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,143.3 $ 1,229.0 $ 1,171.0 year over year change 7.0 % 5.0 % (a) Consists principally of non cash expense accruals for employee benefit obligations (b) Inventory and trade receivables less trade payables The increasing level of benefit plan contributions during the 2003 2005 timeframe primarily reflects our decisions to improve the funded position of several of our major pension and retiree health care plans, as influenced by tax strategies and market factors. We did not have significant statutory or contractual funding requirements for our major retiree benefit plans during the periods presented, nor do we expect to have in the next several years. Total minimum benefit plan contributions for 2006 are currently expected to be approximately $59 million. Actual 2006 or future years contributions could exceed our current projections, as influenced by our decision to voluntarily pre fund our obligations versus other competing investment priorities, future changes in government requirements, or renewals of union contracts. For 2005, the net favorable movement in core working capital was related to increased trade payables, partially offset by an unfavorable movement in trade receivables, which returned to historical levels (in relation to sales) in early 2005 from lower levels at the end of 2004. We believe these lower levels were related to the timing of our 53rd week over the 2004 holiday period, which impacted the core working capital component of our operating cash flow throughout 2005. Core working capital as a percentage of sales has steadily improved over the past several years, representing 7.0% of net sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 7.3% for 2004 and 8.2% for 2003. We have achieved this multi year reduction primarily through logistics improvements to reduce inventory on hand while continuing to meet customer requirements, faster collection of accounts receivable, and extension of terms on trade payables. While our long term goal is to continue to improve this metric, we no longer expect movements in the absolute balance of core working capital to represent a significant source of operating cash flow. The unfavorable movements in other working capital for 2004, as presented in the preceding table, relate largely to higher income tax payments and faster payment of customer promotional incentives, as compared to prior years. 16 Table of Contents Our management measure of cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions. We use this non GAAP measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment, dividend distributions, acquisition opportunities, and share repurchase. Our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measure, as follows: (dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,143.3 $ 1,229.0 $ 1,171.0 Additions to properties (374.2 ) (278.6 ) (247.2 ) Cash flow $ 769.1 $ 950.4 $ 923.8 year over year change 19.1 % 2.9 % Our 2005 cash flow (as defined) declined approximately 19% versus the prior year, attributable primarily to incremental benefit plan contributions as discussed on page 16 and increased spending for selected capacity expansions to accommodate our Companys strong sales growth over the past several years. This increased capital spending represented 3.7% of net sales, which exceeds our recent historical spending level of approximately 3% of net sales for both 2004 and 2003. We expect this trend to continue in the near term, with projected 2006 property expenditures reaching approximately 4.0% of net sales. We currently expect our cash flow for 2006 to be $875 $975 million, with the increase over the 2005 amount funded principally by a decline in benefit plan contributions, partially offset by a slight increase in capital spending as a percentage of sales. In order to support the continued growth of our North American fruit snacks business, we completed two separate business acquisitions during 2005 for a total of approximately $50 million in cash, including related transaction costs. In June 2005, we acquired a fruit snacks manufacturing facility and related assets from Kraft Foods Inc. The facility is located in Chicago, Illinois and employs approximately 400 active hourly and salaried employees. In November 2005, we acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of a Washington State based manufacturer of natural and organic fruit snacks. For 2005, our Board of Directors had originally authorized stock repurchases for general corporate purposes and to offset issuances for employee benefit programs of up to $400 million. In October 2005, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the authorized amount of 2005 stock repurchases to $675 million and an additional $650 million for 2006. Pursuant to this authorization, in November 2005, we repurchased approximately 9.4 million common shares from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation Trust (the Trust) for $400 million in a privately negotiated transaction pursuant to an agreement dated as of November 8, 2005 (the 2005 Agreement). The 2005 Agreement provided the Trust with registration rights in certain circumstances for additional common shares which the Trust might desire to sell and provided the Company with rights to repurchase those additional common shares. In combination with open market transactions completed prior to November 2005, we spent a total of $664 million to repurchase approximately 15.4 million shares during 2005. Pursuant to similar Board authorizations applicable to those years, we paid $298 million in 2004 for approximately 7.3 million shares and $90 million during 2003 for approximately 2.9 million shares. In connection with our 2006 stock repurchase authorization, we entered into an agreement with the Trust dated as of February 16, 2006 (the 2006 Agreement) to repurchase approximately 12.8 million additional shares from the Trust for $550 million. The 2006 Agreement extinguished the registration and repurchase rights under the 2005 Agreement upon the Companys repurchase of those additional shares on February 21, 2006. In July 2005, we redeemed $723.4 million of long term debt, representing the remaining principal balance of our 6.0% U.S. Dollar Notes due April 2006. In October 2005, we repaid $200 million of maturing 4.875% U.S. Dollar Notes. In December 2005, we redeemed $35.4 million of U.S. Dollar Notes due June 2008. These payments were funded principally through issuance of U.S. Dollar short term debt. During November 2005, subsidiaries of the Company issued approximately $930 million of foreign currency denominated debt in offerings outside of the United States, consisting of Euro 550 million of floating rate notes due 2007 and approximately C$330 million of Canadian commercial paper. These debt issuances were guaranteed by the Company and net proceeds were used primarily for the payment of dividends pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act and the purchase of stock and assets of other direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Company, as well as for general corporate purposes. (Refer to Note 7 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these debt issuances.) At December 31, 2005, our total debt was approximately $4.9 billion, approximately even with the balance at year end 2004. As discussed in the Interest expense section on page 15, this debt balance represents nearly a $2.0 billion reduction from a peak level of $6.8 billion in early 2001. During 2005, we increased our benefit trust investments through plan funding by approximately 13%, reduced the Companys common stock outstanding through repurchase programs by approximately 4%, and implemented a mid year increase in the shareholder dividend level of approximately 10%. Primarily due to the recent 17 Table of Contents prioritization of these uses of cash flow, plus the aforementioned need to selectively invest in production capacity, we no longer expect to reduce debt at the recent historical pace, but remain committed to net debt reduction (total debt less cash) over the long term. We currently expect the total debt balance at year end 2006 to remain at approximately $4.9 billion. We believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future, while still meeting our operational needs, including the pursuit of selected growth opportunities, through our strong cash flow, our program of issuing short term debt, and maintaining credit facilities on a global basis. Our significant long term debt issues do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings. A change in the Companys credit ratings could limit its access to the U.S. short term debt market and or increase the cost of refinancing long term debt in the future. However, even under these circumstances, we would continue to have access to our credit facilities, which are in amounts sufficient to cover the outstanding short term debt balance and debt principal repayments through 2006. Off balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Obligations Contractual obligations The following table summarizes future estimated cash payments to be made under existing contractual obligations. Further information on debt obligations is contained in Note 7 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Further information on lease obligations is contained in Note 6. Contractual obligations Payments due by period 2011 and (millions) Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 beyond Long term debt(a) $ 6,476.8 $ 282.9 $ 847.2 $ 653.3 $ 181.8 $ 181.7 $ 4,329.9 Capital leases 4.6 1.9 1.4 .5 .5 .2 .1 Operating leases 459.1 102.3 85.6 63.7 47.5 43.3 116.7 Purchase obligations(b) 447.8 289.0 96.3 30.2 20.9 10.9 .5 Other long term(c) 260.2 31.0 12.3 29.5 11.7 15.1 160.6 Total $ 7,648.5 $ 707.1 $ 1,042.8 $ 777.2 $ 262.4 $ 251.2 $ 4,607.8 (a) Long term debt obligations include amounts due for both principal and fixed rate interest payments. (b) Purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments under various co marketing agreements and to a lesser extent, of service agreements, and contracts for future delivery of commodities, packaging materials, and equipment. The amounts presented in the table do not include items already recorded in accounts payable or other current liabilities at year end 2005, nor does the table reflect cash flows we are likely to incur based on our plans, but are not obligated to incur. Therefore, it should be noted that the exclusion of these items from the table could be a limitation in assessing our total future cash flows under contracts. (c) Other long term contractual obligations are those associated with noncurrent liabilities recorded within the Consolidated Balance Sheet at year end 2005 and consist principally of projected commitments under deferred compensation arrangements, multiemployer pension plans, and other retiree benefits in excess of those provided within our broad based plans. We do not currently have significant statutory or contractual funding requirements for our broad based retiree benefit plans during the periods presented and have not included these amounts in the table. Refer to Notes 9 and 10 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these plans, including expected contributions for fiscal year 2006. Off balance sheet arrangements Our off balance sheet arrangements are generally limited to a residual value guarantee on one operating lease of approximately $13 million and guarantees on loans to independent contractors for their purchase of DSD route franchises up to $17 million. We record the fair value of these loan guarantees on our balance sheet, which we currently estimate to be insignificant. Refer to Note 6 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Significant Accounting Estimates Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. None of the pronouncements adopted during the periods presented have had or are expected to have a significant impact on our Companys financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(Revised) Share Based Payment, which we adopted as of the beginning of our 2006 fiscal year, using the modified prospective method. Accordingly, 18 Table of Contents prior years were not restated, but 2006 results are being presented as if we had applied the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation from our 1996 fiscal year. If this standard had been adopted in 2005, net earnings per share would have been reduced by approximately $.09 and we currently expect a similar impact of adoption for 2006. However, the actual impact on 2006 will, in part, depend on the particular structure of stock based awards granted during the year and various market factors that affect the fair value of awards. We classify pre tax stock compensation expense in selling, general, and administrative expense principally within our corporate operations. SFAS No. 123(Revised) also provides that any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings will be presented in the Statement of Cash Flows as a financing (rather than an operating) cash flow. If this standard had been adopted in 2005, operating cash flow would have been lower (and financing cash flow would have been higher) by approximately $20 million as a result of this provision. The actual impact on 2006 operating cash flow will depend, in part, on the volume of employee stock option exercises during the year and the relationship between the exercise date market value of the underlying stock and the original grant date fair value determined for financial reporting purposes. Our critical accounting estimates, which require significant judgments and assumptions likely to have a material impact on our financial statements, are discussed in the following sections on pages 19 21. Promotional expenditures Our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and involve in store displays and events; feature price discounts on our products; consumer coupons, contests, and loyalty programs; and similar activities. The costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded, which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure. The recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer. These estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs. Differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally insignificant and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. On a full year basis, these subsequent period adjustments have rarely represented in excess of .4% (.004) of our Companys net sales. However, as our Companys total promotional expenditures (including amounts classified as a revenue reduction) represented nearly 30% of 2005 net sales; the likelihood exists of materially different reported results if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail. Intangibles We follow SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in evaluating impairment of intangibles. Under this standard, goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit with associated goodwill. Carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units. The fair value of a reporting unit is based primarily on our assessment of profitability multiples likely to be achieved in a theoretical sale transaction. Similarly, impairment testing of other intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset. Fair values of non goodwill intangible assets are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset. For instance, cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales. These estimates are made using various inputs including historical data, current and anticipated market conditions, management plans, and market comparables. We periodically engage third party valuation consultants to assist in this process. At December 31, 2005, intangible assets, net, were $4.9 billion, consisting primarily of goodwill and trademarks associated with the 2001 acquisition of Keebler Foods Company. While we currently believe that the fair value of all of our intangibles exceeds carrying value, materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our North American snacks business or the weighted average cost of capital used in the valuations could result in significant impairment losses. Retirement benefits Our Company sponsors a number of U.S. and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the United States and Canada. Plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations. A substantial majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of debt securities and other investments. We follow SFAS No. 87 Employers Accounting for Pensions and SFAS No. 106 Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions for the measurement and recognition of obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans. Embodied in both of these standards is the concept that the cost of benefits 19 Table of Contents provided during retirement should be recognized over the employees active working life. Inherent in this concept is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date. Major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the long term rates of return on plan assets, the health care cost trend rates, and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans, which cover employees in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. To conduct our annual review of the long term rate of return on plan assets, we work with third party financial consultants to model expected returns over a 20 year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans. The return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forward looking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on long term bonds, price earnings ratios of the major stock market indices, and long term inflation. Our U.S. plan model, corresponding to approximately 70% of our trust assets globally, currently incorporates a long term inflation assumption of 2.8% and an active management premium of 1% (net of fees) validated by historical analysis. Although we review our expected long term rates of return annually, our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. Our expected rates of return are generally not revised, provided these rates continue to fall within a more likely than not corridor of between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected long term returns, as determined by our modeling process. Our assumed rate of return for U.S. plans in 2005 of 8.9% equated to approximately the 50th percentile expectation of our 2005 model. Similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets, reflecting local economic conditions. Foreign plan investments represent approximately 30% of our global benefit plan investments. Based on consolidated benefit plan assets at December 31, 2005, a 100 basis point reduction in the assumed rate of return would increase 2006 benefits expense by approximately $36 million. Correspondingly, a 100 basis point shortfall between the assumed and actual rate of return on plan assets for 2006 would result in a similar amount of arising experience loss. Any arising asset related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated value of plan assets over a five year period. Once recognized, experience gains and losses are amortized using a declining balance method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants, which for U.S. plans is presently about 12 years. Under this recognition method, a 100 basis point shortfall in actual versus assumed performance of all of our plan assets in 2006 would reduce pre tax earnings by approximately $1 million in 2007, increasing to approximately $6 million in year 2011. For each of the three years ending December 31, 2005, our actual return on plan assets exceeded the recognized assumed return by the following amounts (in millions): 2005 $39.4; 2004 $95.6; 2003 $269.4. To conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates, we work with third party financial consultants to model our actual claims cost data over a five year historical period, including an analysis of pre 65 versus post 65 age groups and other important demographic components of our covered employee population. This data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends. Our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding short term future trends. In comparison to our actual five year compound annual claims cost growth rate of approximately 9%, our initial trend rate for 2006 of 10.5% reflects the expected future impact of faster growing claims experience for certain demographic groups within our total employee population. Our initial rate is trended downward by 1% per year, until the ultimate trend rate of 4.75% is reached. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Based on consolidated obligations at December 31, 2005, a 100 basis point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase 2006 benefits expense by approximately $17 million. A 100 basis point excess of 2006 actual health care claims cost over that calculated from the assumed trend rate would result in an arising experience loss of approximately $9 million. Any arising claims cost related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated value of claims cost over a four year period. Once recognized, experience gains and losses are amortized over the average remaining service period of active plan participants, which for U.S. plans is presently about 15 years. The combined net experience loss arising from recognition of all prior years claims experience, together with the revised trend rate assumption, was approximately $129 million. To conduct our annual review of discount rates, we use several published market indices with appropriate duration weighting to assess prevailing rates on high quality debt securities, with a primary focus on the Citigroup Pension Liability Index for our U.S. plans. To test the appropriateness of these indices, we 20 Table of Contents periodically engage third party financial consultants to conduct a matching exercise between the expected settlement cash flows of our plans and bond maturities, consisting principally of AA rated (or the equivalent in foreign jurisdictions) non callable issues with at least $25 million principal outstanding. The model does not assume any reinvestment rates and assumes that bond investments mature just in time to pay benefits as they become due. For those years where no suitable bonds are available, the portfolio utilizes a linear interpolation approach to impute a hypothetical bond whose maturity matches the cash flows required in those years. As of three different interim dates in 2005, this matching exercise for our U.S. plans produced a discount rate within +/ 10 basis points of the equivalent dated Citigroup Pension Liability Index. The measurement dates for our benefit plans are generally consistent with our Companys fiscal year end. Thus, we select discount rates to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during December of each year. Based on consolidated obligations at December 31, 2005, a 25 basis point decline in the weighted average discount rate used for benefit plan measurement purposes would increase 2006 benefits expense by approximately $15 million. All obligation related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants. Despite the previously described rigorous policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions, we periodically experience material differences between assumed and actual experience. As of December 31, 2005, we had consolidated unamortized net experience losses of approximately $1.29 billion. Of this total, approximately 70% was related to discount rate reductions, 13% was related to net unfavorable health care claims cost experience (including upward revisions in the assumed trend rate), with the remainder related to asset returns and other demographic factors. For 2006, we currently expect incremental amortization of experience losses of approximately $10 million. Assuming actual future experience is consistent with our current assumptions, annual amortization of accumulated experience losses during each of the next several years would remain approximately level with the 2006 amount. Income taxes Our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may not succeed. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. Our effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that we consider appropriate. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe that our reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. Our tax reserves are presented in the balance sheet principally within accrued income taxes. Significant tax reserve adjustments impacting our effective tax rate would be separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of Note 11 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Historically, tax reserve adjustments for individual issues have rarely exceeded 1% of earnings before income taxes annually. Future Outlook Our long term annual growth targets are low single digit for internal net sales, mid single digit for internal operating profit, and high single digit for net earnings per share. In addition, we remain committed to growing our brand building investment faster than the rate of sales growth. In general, we expect 2006 results to be consistent with our growth targets for net sales and operating profit. We expect each of our operating segments to deliver low single digit net sales growth in 2006, except for Latin America, which we expect to achieve mid single digit growth due to a continuation of the more rapid category expansion in that region. We expect the reported increase in net earnings per share to be dampened by approximately $.09, due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(Revised), as discussed on pages 18 and 19. We will continue to reinvest in cost reduction initiatives and other growth opportunities. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to certain market risks, which exist as a part of the ongoing business operations and management uses derivative financial and commodity instruments, where appropriate, to manage these risks. The Company, as a matter of policy, does not engage in trading or speculative transactions. Refer to Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included herein under Part II, Item 8, for further information on accounting policies related to derivative financial and commodity instruments. Foreign exchange risk The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related to third party purchases, 21 Table of Contents intercompany transactions, and nonfunctional currency denominated third party debt. The Company is also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments. Additionally, the Company is exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency earnings to U.S. Dollars. Primary exposures include the U.S. Dollar versus the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, and Mexican Peso, and in the case of inter subsidiary transactions, the British Pound versus the Euro. Management assesses foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational positions and enters into forward contracts, options, and currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in net long or short currency positions. Forward contracts and options are generally less than 18 months duration. Currency swap agreements are established in conjunction with the term of underlying debt issuances. The total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at year end 2005 was $467.3 million, representing a settlement obligation of $21.9 million. The total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at year end 2004 was $375.5 million, representing a settlement obligation of $60.3 million. All of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions, translational exposure, or existing assets or liabilities, and mature within 18 months. Assuming an unfavorable 10% change in year end exchange rates, the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately $46.7 million at year end 2005 and $37.5 million at year end 2004. These unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures. Interest rate risk The Company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future issuances of variable rate debt. Primary exposures include movements in U.S. Treasury rates, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), and commercial paper rates. Management periodically uses interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs associated with certain debt issues, and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt, based on current and projected market conditions. Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included herein under Part II, Item 8, provides information on the Companys significant debt issues. There were no interest rate derivatives outstanding at year end 2005 and 2004. Assuming average variable rate debt levels during the year, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by approximately $9.1 million in 2005 and $2.3 million in 2004. Price risk The Company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials, fuel, and energy. Primary exposures include corn, wheat, soybean oil, sugar, cocoa, paperboard, natural gas, and diesel fuel. Management uses the combination of long cash positions with suppliers, and exchange traded futures and option contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted purchases over a duration of generally less than one year. The total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at year end 2005 was $21.8 million, representing a settlement receivable of approximately $1.0 million. Assuming a 10% decrease in year end commodity prices, this settlement receivable would convert to an obligation of approximately $1.3 million, generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying material purchases. The total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at year end 2004 was $61.3 million, representing a settlement obligation of $4.8 million. Assuming a 10% decrease in year end commodity prices, this settlement obligation would have increased by approximately $5.6 million, generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying material purchases. In addition to the derivative commodity instruments discussed above, management uses long cash positions with suppliers to manage a portion of the price exposure. It should be noted that the exclusion of these positions from the analysis above could be a limitation in assessing the net market risk of the Company. 22 Table of Contents
