Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Kellogg Company and Subsidiaries Results Of Operations Overview Kellogg Company is the worlds leading producer of cereal and a leading producer of convenience foods, including cookies, crackers, toaster pastries, cereal bars, fruit snacks, frozen waffles, and veggie foods. Kellogg products are manufactured and marketed globally. We currently manage our operations in four geographic operating segments, comprised of North America and the three International operating segments of Europe, Latin America, and Asia Pacific. For the periods presented, the Asia Pacific operating segment included Australia and Asian markets. Beginning in 2007, this segment will also include South Africa, which was formerly a part of Europe. We manage our Company for sustainable performance defined by our long term annual growth targets. During the periods presented, these targets were low single digit for internal net sales, mid single digit for internal operating profit, and high single digit for net earnings per share, which we met or exceeded in each of 2004, 2005, and 2006: Consolidated results (dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Net sales $ 10,906.7 $ 10,177.2 $ 9,613.9 Net sales growth: As reported 7.2% 5.9% 9.1% Internal (a) 6.8% 6.4% 5.0% Operating profit $ 1,765.8 $ 1,750.3 $ 1,681.1 Operating profit growth: As reported (b) .9% 4.1% 8.9% Internal (a) 4.3% 5.2% 4.5% Diluted net earnings per share (EPS) $ 2.51 $ 2.36 $ 2.14 EPS growth (b) 6% 10% 11% (a) Our measure of internal growth excludes the impact of currency and, if applicable, acquisitions, dispositions, and shipping day differences. Specifically, internal net sales and operating profit growth for 2005 and 2004 exclude the impact of a 53rd shipping week in 2004. Internal operating profit growth for 2006 also excludes the impact of adopting SFAS No. 123(R) Share Based Payment. Accordingly, internal operating profit growth for 2006 is a non GAAP financial measure, which is further discussed and reconciled to GAAP basis growth on pages 11 and 12. (b) At the beginning of 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R) Share Based Payment, which reduced our fiscal 2006 operating profit by $65.4 million ($42.4 million after tax or $.11 per share), due primarily to recognition of compensation expense associated with employee and director stock option grants. Correspondingly, our reported operating profit and net earnings growth for 2006 was reduced by approximately 4%. Diluted net earnings per share growth was reduced by approximately 5%. Refer to the section beginning on page 21 entitled Stock compensation for further information on the Companys adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). In combination with an attractive dividend yield, we believe this profitable growth has and will continue to provide a strong total return to our shareholders. We plan to continue to achieve this sustainability through a strategy focused on growing our cereal business, expanding our snacks business, and pursuing selected growth opportunities. We support our business strategy with operating principles that emphasize profit rich, sustainable sales growth, as well as cash flow and return on invested capital. We believe our steady earnings growth, strong cash flow, and continued investment during a multi year period of significant commodity and energy driven cost inflation demonstrates the strength and flexibility of our business model. Net sales and operating profit 2006 compared to 2005 The following tables provide an analysis of net sales and operating profit performance for 2006 versus 2005: Asia North Latin Pacific Consoli (dollars in millions) America Europe America (a) Corporate dated 2006 net sales $ 7,348.8 $ 2,143.8 $ 890.8 $ 523.3 $ $ 10,906.7 2005 net sales $ 6,807.8 $ 2,013.6 $ 822.2 $ 533.6 $ $ 10,177.2 % change 2006 vs. 2005: Volume (tonnage) (b) 3.5% 1.4% 4.5% 1.2% 3.1% Pricing/mix 4.0% 4.0% 4.0% .9% 3.7% Subtotal internal business 7.5% 5.4% 8.5% .3% 6.8% Foreign currency impact .4% 1.1% .2% 1.6% .4% Total change 7.9% 6.5% 8.3% 1.9% 7.2% Asia North Latin Pacific Consoli (dollars in millions) America Europe America (a) Corporate dated 2006 operating profit $ 1,340.5 $ 334.1 $ 220.1 $ 76.9 $ (205.8 ) $ 1,765.8 2005 operating profit $ 1,251.5 $ 330.7 $ 202.8 $ 86.0 $ (120.7 ) $ 1,750.3 % change 2006 vs. 2005: Internal business 6.5% .7% 9.3% 8.7% 16.2% 4.3% SFAS No. 123(R) adoption impact 54.1% 3.7% Foreign currency impact .6% .3% .8% 1.9% .3% Total change 7.1% 1.0% 8.5% 10.6% 70.3% .9% (a) Includes Australia and Asia. (b) We measure the volume impact (tonnage) on revenues based on the stated weight of our product shipments. During 2006, our consolidated net sales increased 7%, with strong results in both North America and the total of our International segments. Internal net sales also grew 7%, building on a 6% rate of internal growth during 2005. Successful innovation, brand building (advertising and consumer promotion) investment, and in store execution continued to drive broad based sales growth across each 11 Table of Contents of our enterprise wide product groups. In fact, we achieved growth in retail cereal sales within each of our operating segments. For 2006, our North America operating segment reported a net sales increase of 8%. Internal net sales growth was also 8%, with each major product group contributing as follows: retail cereal +3%; retail snacks (cookies, crackers, toaster pastries, cereal bars, fruit snacks) +11%; frozen and specialty (food service, vending, convenience, drug stores, custom manufacturing) channels +8%. The significant growth achieved by our North America snacks business represented nearly one half of the total dollar increase in consolidated internal net sales for 2006. The 2006 growth in North America retail cereal sales was on top of 8% growth in 2005 and represented the 6th consecutive year in which weve increased our dollar share of category sales. Although North America consumer retail cereal consumption remained steady throughout 2006, our shipment revenues declined in the fourth quarter of 2006 by approximately 2% versus the prior year period. We believe this decline was largely attributable to year end retail trade inventory adjustments, which brought inventories in line with year end 2005 levels after several successive quarters of slight inclines. Our International operating segments collectively achieved net sales growth of approximately 6% or 5% on an internal basis, with leading dollar contributions from our UK, France, Mexico, and Venezuela business units. Internal sales of our Asia Pacific operating segment (which represents less than 5% of our consolidated results) were approximately even with the prior year, as solid growth in Australia cereal and Asian markets was offset by weak performance in our Australia snack business. Consolidated operating profit for 2006 grew 1%, with internal operating profit up 4% versus 2005. As discussed on page 11, our measure of internal operating profit growth is consistent with our measure of internal sales growth, except that during 2006, internal operating profit growth also excluded the impact of incremental stock compensation expense associated with our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). We used this non GAAP financial measure during our first year of adopting this FASB standard in order to assist management and investors in assessing the Companys financial operating performance against comparative periods, which did not include stock option related compensation expense. Accordingly, corporate selling, general, and administrative (SGA) expense was higher and operating profit was lower by $65.4 million for 2006, reducing consolidated operating profit growth by approximately four percentage points. Refer to the section beginning on page 21 entitled Stock compensation for further information on the Companys adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). As further discussed beginning on page 14, our measure of internal operating profit growth includes up front costs related to cost reduction initiatives. Although total 2006 up front costs of $82 million were not significantly changed from the 2005 amount of $90 million, a year over year shift in operating segment allocation of such costs affected relative segment performance. The 2006 versus 2005 change in project cost allocation was a $44 million decline in North America (improving 2006 segment operating profit performance by approximately 4%) and a $28 million increase in Europe (reducing 2006 segment operating profit performance by approximately 8%). Our current year operating profit growth was affected by significant cost pressures as discussed in the Margin performance section beginning on page 13. Expenditures for brand building activities increased at a low single digit rate; this rate of growth incorporates savings reinvestment from our recent focus on media buying efficiencies and global leverage of promotional campaigns. Within our total brand building metric, advertising expenditures grew at a high single digit rate for 2006, which is a dynamic that we expect to continue through 2007 due to a relatively heavier focus on promotional efficiencies. Consistent with our long term commitment, we expect to return to higher rates of growth for total brand building expenditures, beginning in 2008. 2005 compared to 2004 The following tables provide an analysis of net sales and operating profit performance for 2005 versus 2004: Asia North Latin Pacific Consoli (dollars in millions) America Europe America (a) Corporate dated 2005 net sales $ 6,807.8 $ 2,013.6 $ 822.2 $ 533.6 $ $ 10,177.2 2004 net sales $ 6,369.3 $ 2,007.3 $ 718.0 $ 519.3 $ $ 9,613.9 % change 2005 vs. 2004: Volume (tonnage) (b) 5.6% .2% 7.5% .8% 4.5% Pricing/mix 2.2% 2.0% 3.2% .4% 1.9% Subtotal internal business 7.8% 1.8% 10.7% 1.2% 6.4% Shipping day differences (c) 1.4% .9% 1.0% 1.1% Foreign currency impact .5% .6% 3.8% 2.6% .6% Total change 6.9% .3% 14.5% 2.8% 5.9% (a) Includes Australia and Asia.

Refer to Note 1 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our fiscal year end. During 2005, consolidated net sales increased nearly 6%. Internal net sales also grew approximately 6%, which was on top of 5% internal sales growth in 2004. For 2005, successful innovation and brand building investment drove strong growth across our North American business units, which collectively reported a 7% increase in net sales versus 2004. Internal net sales of our North America retail cereal business increased 8%, with strong performance in both the United States and Canada. Internal net sales of our North America retail snacks business increased 7% on top of 8% growth in 2004. This growth was attributable principally to sales of fruit snacks, toaster pastries, cracker products, and major cookie brands. Partially offsetting this growth was the impact of proactively managing discontinuation of marginal cookie innovations. Internal net sales of our North America frozen and specialty channel businesses collectively increased approximately 8%, led by solid contributions from our Eggo frozen foods and food service businesses. In 2005, our International operating segments collectively achieved net sales growth of nearly 4% on both a reported and internal basis, with our Latin America operating segment contributing approximately two thirds of the total dollar increase. Nevertheless, we achieved our long term annual growth targets of low single digit for internal net sales in our Europe and Asia Pacific operating segments due primarily to solid innovation performance in southern Europe and Asia. Consolidated operating profit increased 4% during 2005, with our Europe operating segment contributing approximately one half of the total dollar increase. This disproportionate contribution was attributable to a year over year shift in segment allocation of charges from cost reduction initiatives. As discussed in the section beginning on page 14, the 2005 versus 2004 change in project cost allocation was a $65 million decline in Europe (improving 2005 segment operating profit performance by approximately 22%) and a $46 million increase in North America (reducing 2005 segment operating profit performance by approximately 4%). Internal growth in consolidated operating profit was 5%. This internal growth was achieved despite double digit growth in brand building and innovation expenditures and significant cost pressures on gross margin, as discussed in the following section. During 2005, we increased our consolidated brand building (advertising and consumer promotion) expenditures by more than 11/2 times the rate of sales growth. Corporate operating profit for 2004 included a charge of $9.5 million related to CEO transition expenses, which arose from the departure of Carlos Gutierrez, the Companys former CEO, related to his appointment as U.S. Secretary of Commerce in early 2005. The total charge (net of forfeitures) of $9.5 million was comprised principally of $3.7 million for special pension termination benefits and $5.5 million for accelerated vesting of 606,250 stock options. Segment operating profit for 2004 included intangibles impairment losses of $10.4 million, comprised of $7.9 million to write off the carrying value of a contract based intangible asset in North America and $2.5 million to write off goodwill in Latin America. Margin performance Margin performance is presented in the following table. Change vs. prior year (pts.) 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 Gross margin 44.2% 44.9% 44.9% (.7 ) SGA% (a) 28.0% 27.7% 27.4% (.3 ) (.3 ) Operating margin 16.2% 17.2% 17.5% (1.0 ) (.3 ) (a) Selling, general, and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales. We strive for gross margin expansion to reinvest in brand building and innovation expenditures. Our strategy for expanding our gross margin is to manage external cost pressures through product pricing and mix improvements, productivity savings, and technological initiatives to reduce the cost of product ingredients and packaging. Our gross margin performance for 2005 and 2006 reflects the impact of significant fuel, energy, and commodity price inflation experienced throughout most of that time, as well as increased employee benefit costs. In the aggregate, these input cost pressures reduced our consolidated gross margin by approximately 150 basis points for 2006 and 60 basis points in 2005. For 2006, our gross margin performance was also unfavorably impacted by incremental logistics and 13 Table of Contents innovation start up costs related to the recent, significant sales growth within our North America operating segment. While the majority of the inflationary pressure during 2005 and 2006 was commodity and energy driven, employee benefit costs (the majority of which are recorded in cost of goods sold) also increased during that time period, with total active and retired employee benefits expense reaching approximately $325 million in 2006 versus $290 million in 2005 and $260 million in 2004. For 2007, the combined effect of favorable trust asset performance and rising interest rates is expected to have a moderating effect on underlying health care cost inflation. As a result, we expect 2007 benefits expense to be approximately even with the 2006 amount. For 2007, we expect this inflationary trend to continue, with input cost (fuel, energy, commodity, and benefits) pressures forecasted to exceed realized savings. As compared to 2006 results, we currently expect $110 $130 million of incremental cost inflation, primarily associated with the prices of our 2007 ingredient purchases. Accordingly, we believe our 2007 consolidated gross margin could decline by up to 50 basis points. In addition to external cost pressures, our discretionary investment in cost reduction initiatives (refer to following section) has created variability in our gross margin performance during the periods presented. Although total annual program related charges were relatively steady over the past several years, the amount recorded in cost of goods sold varied by year (in millions): 2006$74; 2005$90; 2004$46. Additionally, cost of goods sold for 2005 includes a charge of approximately $12 million, related to a lump sum payment to members of the major union representing the hourly employees at our U.S. cereal plants for ratification of a wage and benefits agreement with the Company covering the four year period ended October 2009. For 2006, both our SGA% and operating margin were affected by our fiscal 2006 adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). During 2006, we reported incremental stock compensation expense of $65.4 million, which increased our SGA% and reduced our operating margin by approximately 60 basis points. Refer to the section beginning on page 21 entitled Stock compensation for further information on this subject. Cost reduction initiatives We view our continued spending on cost reduction initiatives as part of our ongoing operating principles to reinvest earnings so as to provide greater reliability in meeting long term growth targets. Initiatives undertaken must meet certain pay back and internal rate of return (IRR) targets. We currently require each project to recover total cash implementation costs within a five year period of completion or to achieve an IRR of at least 20%. Each cost reduction initiative is normally one to three years in duration. Upon completion (or as each major stage is completed in the case of multi year programs), the project begins to deliver cash savings and or reduced depreciation, which is then used to fund new initiatives. To implement these programs, the Company has incurred various up front costs, including asset write offs, exit charges, and other project expenditures, which we include in our measure and discussion of operating segment profitability within the Net sales and operating profit section beginning on page 11. In 2006, we commenced a multi year European manufacturing optimization plan to improve utilization of our facility in Manchester, England and to better align production in Europe. Based on forecasted foreign exchange rates, the Company currently expects to incur approximately $60 million in total up front costs (including those already incurred in 2006), comprised of approximately 80% cash and 20% non cash asset write offs, to complete this initiative. The cash portion of the total up front costs results principally from our plan to eliminate approximately 220 hourly and salaried positions from the Manchester facility by the end of 2008 through voluntary early retirement and severance programs. For 2006, we incurred approximately $28 million of total up front costs and expect to incur a similar amount in 2007, leaving a relatively insignificant amount to be incurred in 2008. Cash requirements for this initiative are expected to exceed projected cash charges by approximately $10 million in total due to incremental pension trust funding requirements of early retirements; most of this incremental funding occurred in 2006. Also during 2006, we implemented several short term initiatives to enhance the productivity and efficiency of our U.S. cereal manufacturing network and streamlined our sales distribution system in a Latin American market. In 2005, we undertook an initiative to consolidate U.S. snacks bakery capacity, resulting in the closure and sale of two facilities by mid 2006. Major initiatives commenced in 2004 were the global rollout of the SAP information technology system, reorganization of pan European operations, consolidation of U.S. veggie foods manufacturing operations, and relocation of our U.S. snacks business unit to Battle Creek, Michigan. Except for the aforementioned European manufacturing optimization plan, our other initiatives were substantially complete at December 30, 2006. Details of each initiative are described in Note 3 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 14 Table of Contents For 2006, the Company recorded total program related charges of approximately $82 million, comprised of $20 million of asset write offs, $30 million for severance and other exit costs, $9 million for other cash expenditures, $4 million for a multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability, and $19 million for pension and other postretirement plan curtailment losses and special termination benefits. Approximately $74 million of the total 2006 charges were recorded in cost of goods sold within operating segment results, with approximately $8 million recorded in SGA expense within corporate results. The Companys operating segments were impacted as follows (in millions): North America$46; Europe$28. For 2005, total program related charges were approximately $90 million, comprised of $16 million for a multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability, $44 million of asset write offs, $21 million in severance and other exit costs, and $9 million for other cash expenditures. All of the charges were recorded in cost of goods sold within our North America operating segment. For 2004, total program related charges were approximately $109 million, comprised of $41 million in asset write offs, $1 million for special pension termination benefits, $15 million in severance and other exit costs, and $52 million in other cash expenditures such as relocation and consulting. Approximately $46 million of the total 2004 charges were recorded in cost of goods sold, with approximately $63 million recorded in SGA expense. The 2004 charges impacted our operating segments as follows (in millions): North America$44; Europe$65. For the periods presented, cash requirements to implement these programs approximated the exit costs and other cash charges incurred in each year, except for approximately $8 million of incremental pension trust funding that occurred in 2006 in connection with the European manufacturing optimization plan. At December 30, 2006, the Companys remaining cash commitments to complete the executed programs were comprised of: 1) exit cost reserves of $14 million expected to be paid out in 2007; 2) approximately $25 million of projected spending and pension trust funding during 2007 and 2008 associated with the European manufacturing optimization plan; and 3) an estimated multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability of $20 million, which will not be finally determined until 2008 and once determined, is payable to the pension fund over a 20 year maximum period. We expect these cash requirements to be funded by operating cash flow. Our 2007 earnings target includes total projected charges related to in progress and potential cost reduction initiatives of approximately $80 million or $.14 per share. Approximately one third of this total is allocated to the European manufacturing optimization plan. However, the specific cash versus non cash mix or cost of goods sold versus SGA expense impact of the remainder has not yet been determined. Other potential initiatives to be commenced in 2007 are still in the planning stages and individual actions will be announced as we commit to these discretionary investments. Interest expense As illustrated in the following table, annual interest expense for the 2004 2006 period has been relatively steady at approximately $300 million per year, which reflects a stable effective interest rate on total debt and a relatively constant debt balance throughout most of that time. Interest income (recorded in other income) has trended upward from approximately $7 million in 2004 to $11 million in 2006, resulting in net interest expense of approximately $296 million for 2006. We currently expect that our 2007 net interest expense will approximate the 2006 level. Change vs. (dollars in millions) prior year 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 Reported interest expense (a) $ 307.4 $ 300.3 $ 308.6 Amounts capitalized 2.7 1.2 .9 Gross interest expense $ 310.1 $ 301.5 $ 309.5 2.9% 2.6% (a) Reported interest expense for 2005 and 2004 include charges of approximately $13 and $4, respectively, related to the early redemption of long term debt. Other income (expense), net Other income (expense), net includes non operating items such as interest income, charitable donations, and foreign exchange gains and losses. Other income (expense), net for the periods presented was (in millions): 2006$13.2; 2005($24.9); 2004($6.6). The variability in other income (expense), net, among years reflects the timing of certain significant charges explained in the following paragraph and net foreign exchange transaction losses included therein of (in millions): 2006$2; 2005$2; 2004$15. Other expense includes charges for contributions to the Kelloggs Corporate Citizenship Fund, a private trust established for charitable giving, as follows (in millions): 2006$3; 2005$16; 2004$9. Other expense for 2005 also includes a charge of approximately $7 million to reduce the carrying value of a corporate commercial facility to estimated selling value. This facility was sold in August 2006. 15 Table of Contents Income taxes Our long term objective is to achieve a consolidated effective income tax rate of approximately 31 32%. In comparison to a U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 35%, we pursue planning initiatives globally in order to move toward our long term target. Excluding the impact of discrete adjustments, our sustainable consolidated effective income tax rate for both 2006 and 2005 was approximately 33%, which is what we currently expect for 2007. Our reported rates of approximately 32% for 2006 and 31% for 2005 were lower due to the favorable effect of various discrete adjustments such as audit settlements, statutory rate changes, and other deferred tax liability adjustments. (Refer to Note 11 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.) Similarly, our 2007 consolidated effective income tax rate could be up to 200 basis points lower than the aforementioned sustainable rate if pending uncertain tax matters, including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives, are resolved more favorably than we currently expect. We expect that any incremental benefits from such discrete events would be invested in cost reduction initiatives and other growth opportunities. The consolidated effective income tax rate for 2004 of nearly 35% was higher than the rates for 2006 and 2005 primarily because this period preceded the final reorganization of our European operations which favorably affected the country weighting impact on our rate. (Refer to Note 3 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on this initiative.) Additionally, the 2004 consolidated effective income tax rate included a provision of approximately $28 million (net of related foreign tax credits) for approximately $1.1 billion of dividends from foreign subsidiaries which we elected to repatriate in 2005 under the American Jobs Creation Act. Finally, 2005 was the first year in which we were permitted to claim a phased in deduction from U.S. taxable income equal to a stipulated percentage of qualified production income (QPI). Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows, supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions. This cash generating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs. The principal source of our operating cash flow is net earnings, meaning cash receipts from the sale of our products, net of costs to manufacture and market our products. Our cash conversion cycle is relatively short; although receivable collection patterns vary around the world, in the United States, our days sales outstanding (DSO) averaged approximately 19 days during the periods presented. As a result, our operating cash flow should generally reflect our net earnings performance over time, although, as illustrated in the following schedule, specific results for any particular year may be significantly affected by the level of benefit plan contributions, working capital movements (operating assets and liabilities) and other factors. (dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Operating activities Net earnings $ 1,004.1 $ 980.4 $ 890.6 year over year change 2.4 % 10.1 % Items in net earnings not requiring (providing) cash: Depreciation and amortization 352.7 391.8 410.0 Deferred income taxes (43.7 ) (59.2 ) 57.7 Other (a) 235.2 199.3 104.5 Net earnings after non cash items 1,548.3 1,512.3 1,462.8 year over year change 2.4 % 3.4 % Pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions (99.3 ) (397.3 ) (204.0 ) Changes in operating assets and liabilities: Core working capital (b) (137.2 ) 45.4 46.0 Other working capital 98.7 (17.1 ) (75.8 ) Total (38.5 ) 28.3 (29.8 ) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,410.5 $ 1,143.3 $ 1,229.0 year over year change 23.4 % 7.0 % (a) Consists principally of non cash expense accruals for employee compensation and benefit obligations. (b) Inventory and trade receivables less trade payables. Our operating cash flow for 2006 was approximately $267 million higher than 2005, due primarily to lower benefit plan contributions, partially offset by unfavorable working capital movements. Correspondingly, operating cash flow for 2005 was approximately $86 million lower than 2004, due principally to a significant increase in benefit plan contributions. The decline in benefit plan contributions for 2006 reflects the improved funded position of our major benefit plans that was achieved through a significant amount of funding in the 2003 2005 period. On August 17, 2006, the Pension Protection Act (PPA) became law in the United States. The PPA revised the basis and methodology for determining defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements as well as maximum contributions to and benefits paid from tax qualified plans. Most of these provisions are first applicable to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2008 on a phased in basis. The PPA will ultimately require us to make additional contributions to our U.S. plans. However, due to our historical 16 Table of Contents funding practices, we currently believe that we will not be required to make any contributions under the new PPA requirements until after 2012. Accordingly, we do not expect to have significant statutory or contractual funding requirements for our major retiree benefit plans during the next several years, with total 2007 U.S. and foreign plan contributions currently estimated at approximately $54 million. Actual 2007 contributions could exceed our current projections, as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities, future changes in government requirements, renewals of union contracts, or higher than expected health care claims experience. Additionally, our projections concerning timing of PPA funding requirements are subject to change primarily based on general market conditions affecting trust asset performance and our future decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the PPA. In comparison to 2005, the unfavorable movement in core working capital during 2006 was related to trade payables performance and higher inventory balances. At December 30, 2006, our consolidated trade payables balance was within 3% of the balance at year end 2005. In contrast, our trade payables balance increased approximately 22% during 2005, from a historically low level at the end of 2004. The higher inventory balance was principally related to higher commodity prices for our raw material and packaging inventories and to a lesser extent, the overall increase in the average number of weeks of inventory on hand. Our consolidated inventory balances were unfavorably affected by U.S. capacity limitations during 2006; nevertheless, our consolidated inventory balances remain at industry leading levels. Despite the unfavorable movement in the absolute balance, average core working capital continues to improve as a percentage of net sales. For the trailing fifty two weeks ended December 30, 2006, core working capital was 6.8% of net sales, as compared to 7.0% as of year end 2005 and 7.3% as of year end 2004. We have achieved this multi year reduction primarily through faster collection of accounts receivable and extension of terms on trade payables. Up until 2006, we had also been successful in implementing logistics improvements to reduce inventory on hand while continuing to meet customer requirements. We believe the opportunity to reduce inventory from year end 2006 levels could represent a source of operating cash flow during 2007. For 2005, the net favorable movement in core working capital was related to the aforementioned increase in trade payables, partially offset by an unfavorable movement in trade receivables, which returned to historical levels (in relation to sales) in early 2005 from lower levels at the end of 2004. We believe these lower levels were related to the timing of our 53rd week over the 2004 holiday period, which impacted the core working capital component of our operating cash flow throughout 2005. As presented in the table on page 16, other working capital was a source of cash in 2006 versus a use of cash in 2005. The year over year favorable variance of approximately $116 million was attributable to several factors including lower debt related currency swap payments in 2006 as well as business related growth in accrued compensation and promotional liabilities. The unfavorable movement in other working capital for 2004, as compared to succeeding years, primarily relates to a decrease in current income tax liabilities which is offset in the deferred income taxes line item. Our management measure of cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions. We use this non GAAP financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment, dividend distributions, acquisition opportunities, and share repurchase. Our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measure, as follows: (dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,410.5 $ 1,143.3 $ 1,229.0 Additions to properties (453.1 ) (374.2 ) (278.6 ) Cash flow $ 957.4 $ 769.1 $ 950.4 year over year change 24.5 % 19.1 % Our 2006 and 2005 cash flow (as defined) performance reflects increased spending for selected capacity expansions to accommodate our Companys strong sales growth over the past several years. This increased capital spending represented 4.2% of net sales in 2006 and 3.7% of net sales in 2005, as compared to 2.9% in 2004. For 2007, we currently expect property expenditures to remain at approximately 4% of net sales, which is consistent with our long term target for capital spending. This forecast includes expenditures associated with the construction of a new manufacturing facility in Ontario, Canada, which represents approximately 15% of our 2007 capital plan. This facility is being constructed to satisfy existing capacity needs in our North America business, which we believe will partially ease certain of the aforementioned logistics and inventory management issues which we encountered during 2006. For 2007, we are targeting cash flow of $950 $1,025 million. We expect to achieve our target principally through operating 17 Table of Contents profit growth, which is forecasted to offset higher levels of capital spending and income tax payments during 2007. In order to support the continued growth of our North American fruit snacks business, we completed two separate business acquisitions during 2005 for a total of approximately $50 million in cash, including related transaction costs. In June 2005, we acquired a fruit snacks manufacturing facility and related assets from Kraft Foods Inc. The facility is located in Chicago, Illinois and employs approximately 400 active hourly and salaried employees. In November 2005, we acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of a Washington State based manufacturer of natural and organic fruit snacks. For 2006, our Board of Directors authorized stock repurchases for general corporate purposes and to offset issuances for employee benefit programs of up to $650 million, which we spent to repurchase approximately 14.9 million shares. This activity consisted principally of a February 2006 private transaction with the W.K. Kellogg Foundation Trust (the Trust) to repurchase approximately 12.8 million shares for $550 million. Pursuant to similar Board authorizations applicable to those years, we paid $664 million in 2005 to repurchase approximately 15.4 million shares and $298 million in 2004 for approximately 7.3 million shares. The 2005 activity consisted principally of a November 2005 private transaction with the Trust to repurchase approximately 9.4 million shares for $400 million. For 2007, our Board of Directors has authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $650 million. In July 2005, we redeemed $723.4 million of long term debt, representing the remaining principal balance of our 6.0% U.S. Dollar Notes due April 2006. In October 2005, we repaid $200 million of maturing 4.875% U.S. Dollar Notes. In December 2005, we redeemed $35.4 million of U.S. Dollar Notes due June 2008. These payments were funded principally through issuance of U.S. Dollar short term debt. During November 2005, subsidiaries of the Company issued approximately $930 million of foreign currency denominated debt in offerings outside of the United States, consisting of Euro 550 million of floating rate notes due 2007 (the Euro Notes) and approximately C$330 million of Canadian commercial paper. These debt issuances were guaranteed by the Company and net proceeds were used primarily for the payment of dividends pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act and the purchase of stock and assets of other direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Company, as well as for general corporate purposes. To utilize excess cash and reduce financing costs, on January 31, 2007, we announced an early redemption of the Euro Notes, effective February 28, 2007. To partially refinance this redemption, we established a program to issue euro commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $750 million or its equivalent in alternative currencies. The notes may have maturities ranging up to 364 days and will be senior unsecured obligations of the applicable issuer, with subsidiary issuances guaranteed by the Company. In connection with these financing activities, we increased our short term lines of credit from $2.2 billion at December 30, 2006 to approximately $2.6 billion, via a $400 million unsecured 364 Day Credit Agreement effective January 31, 2007. The 364 Day Agreement contains customary covenants, warranties, and restrictions similar to those applicable to our existing $2.0 billion Five Year Credit Agreement, which expires in 2011. These facilities are available for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper back up, although the Company does not currently anticipate any usage under the facilities. (Refer to Note 7 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our debt issuances and credit facilities.) At December 30, 2006, our total debt was approximately $5.0 billion, approximately even with the balances at year end 2005 and 2004. During 2005, we increased our benefit trust investments through plan funding by approximately 13%, reduced the Companys common stock outstanding through repurchase programs by approximately 4%, and implemented a mid year increase in the shareholder dividend level of approximately 10%. Similarly, during 2006, we further reduced our common stock outstanding through repurchase programs by approximately 4% and implemented a mid year increase in the shareholder dividend level of approximately 5%. Primarily due to the prioritization of these uses of cash flow, plus the aforementioned need to selectively invest in production capacity, we did not reduce our total debt balance during the past two years, but remain committed to net debt reduction (total debt less cash) over the long term. We currently expect the total debt balance at year end 2007 to be slightly higher than the 2006 year end level. We believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future, while still meeting our operational needs, including the pursuit of selected growth opportunities, through our strong cash flow, our program of issuing short term debt, and maintaining credit facilities on a global basis. Our significant long term debt issues do not 18 Table of Contents contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings. A change in the Companys credit ratings could limit its access to the U.S. short term debt market and or increase the cost of refinancing long term debt in the future. However, even under these circumstances, we would continue to have access to our credit facilities, which are in amounts sufficient to cover our outstanding commercial paper balance, which was $1.3 billion at December 30, 2006. In addition, assuming continuation of market liquidity, we believe it would be possible to term out certain short term maturities or obtain additional credit facilities such that the Company could further extend its ability to meet its long term borrowing obligations through 2008. Off balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Obligations Off balance sheet arrangements Our off balance sheet arrangements are generally limited to a residual value guarantee on one operating lease of approximately $13 million, which will expire in July 2007, and guarantees on loans to independent contractors for their purchase of DSD route franchises up to $17 million. We record the estimated fair value of these loan guarantees on our balance sheet, which was insignificant for the periods presented. Refer to Note 6 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Contractual obligations The following table summarizes future estimated cash payments to be made under existing contractual obligations. Further information on debt obligations is contained in Note 7 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Further information on lease obligations is contained in Note 6. Contractual obligations Payments due by period 2012 and (millions) Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 beyond Long term debt: Principal $ 3,792.4 $ 723.3 $ 466.1 $ 1.2 $ 1.1 $ 1,500.5 $ 1,100.2 Interest (a) 2,474.0 194.7 187.8 181.0 181.0 131.5 1,598.0 Capital leases 9.4 2.1 1.4 1.3 1.0 .6 3.0 Operating leases 575.1 119.7 103.4 85.9 67.7 49.8 148.6 Purchase obligations (b) 506.1 399.4 62.7 32.3 10.8 .4 .5 Other long term (c) 570.0 98.5 90.0 60.6 63.1 58.9 198.9 Total $ 7,927.0 $ 1,537.7 $ 911.4 $ 362.3 $ 324.7 $ 1,741.7 $ 3,049.2 (a) Includes interest payments on long term fixed rate debt. As of December 30, 2006, the Company did not have any long term variable rate debt or any outstanding interest rate derivative financial instruments. (b) Purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments under various co marketing agreements and to a lesser extent, of service agreements, and contracts for future delivery of commodities, packaging materials, and equipment. The amounts presented in the table do not include items already recorded in accounts payable or other current liabilities at year end 2006, nor does the table reflect cash flows we are likely to incur based on our plans, but are not obligated to incur. Therefore, it should be noted that the exclusion of these items from the table could be a limitation in assessing our total future cash flows under contracts. (c) Other long term contractual obligations are those associated with noncurrent liabilities recorded within the Consolidated Balance Sheet at year end 2006 and consist principally of projected commitments under deferred compensation arrangements, multiemployer plans, and supplemental employee retirement benefits. The table also includes our current estimate of minimum contributions to defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans through 2012 as follows: 2007$54; 2008$49; 2009$41; 2010$42; 2011$42; 2012$43. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Accounting Estimates Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2006, we adopted two new accounting pronouncements which had a significant impact on our Companys financial statements. At the beginning of 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R) Share Based Payment, which materially reduced our fiscal 2006 results, due primarily to the first time recognition of compensation expense associated with employee and director stock option grants. This topic is further discussed in the section beginning on page 21. Secondly, at the end of 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 158 Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, which required us to reflect the net over or under funded position of our defined postretirement and postemployment benefit plans as an asset or liability on the balance sheet, with unrecognized prior service cost and net experience losses recorded in shareholders equity. Under pre existing guidance, these unrecognized amounts, which totaled approximately $890.8 million at December 30, 2006, were disclosed only in financial statement footnotes. Accordingly, the after tax presentation of these amounts on the balance sheet reduced consolidated net assets and shareholders equity by $591.9 million at year end 2006. Nevertheless, we do not believe this impact is economically significant because our net earnings, cash flow, liquidity, debt covenants, and plan funding requirements were not affected by this change in accounting principle. Refer to Note 1 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on SFAS No. 158. Refer to the section beginning on page 22 for information on our process for estimating benefit obligations. At the beginning of our 2007 fiscal year, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income 19 Table of Contents Taxes (FIN No. 48), which affects our process for estimating tax benefits and liabilities, as further discussed in the Income taxes section beginning on page 24. The initial application of FIN No. 48 resulted in a net decrease to accrued income tax and related interest liabilities of approximately $2 million, with an offsetting increase to retained earnings. Refer to Note 1 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on FIN No. 48. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157 Fair Value Measurements to provide enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. The standard also expands disclosure requirements for assets and liabilities measured at fair value, how fair value is determined, and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. The standard applies whenever other authoritative literature requires (or permits) certain assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value, but does not expand the use of fair value. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted. We plan to adopt SFAS No. 157 in the first quarter of our 2008 fiscal year. For the Company, balance sheet items carried at fair value consist primarily of derivatives and other financial instruments, assets held for sale, exit liabilities, and the trust asset component of net benefit plan obligations. Relevant to the Intangibles section beginning on this page, we also use fair value concepts to test various long lived assets for impairment and to initially measure assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination. We are currently evaluating the impact of adoption on how these assets and liabilities are currently measured. Our critical accounting estimates, which require significant judgments and assumptions likely to have a material impact on our financial statements, are discussed in the following sections on pages 20 25. Promotional expenditures Our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and involve in store displays and events; feature price discounts on our products; consumer coupons, contests, and loyalty programs; and similar activities. The costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded, which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure. The recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer. These estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs. Differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally insignificant and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. On a full year basis, these subsequent period adjustments have rarely represented in excess of .4% (.004) of our Companys net sales. However, as our Companys total promotional expenditures (including amounts classified as a revenue reduction) represented nearly 30% of 2006 net sales, the likelihood exists of materially different reported results if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail. Intangibles We follow SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in evaluating impairment of intangibles. We perform this evaluation at least annually during the fourth quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual budgeting process. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit with associated goodwill. Carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units. The fair value of a reporting unit is based primarily on our assessment of profitability multiples likely to be achieved in a theoretical sale transaction. Similarly, impairment testing of other intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset. Fair values of non goodwill intangible assets are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset. For instance, cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales. These estimates are made using various inputs including historical data, current and anticipated market conditions, management plans, and market comparables. We periodically engage third party valuation consultants to assist in this process. We also follow SFAS No. 142 in evaluating the useful life over which a non goodwill intangible asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the cash flows of the Company. An intangible asset with a finite useful life is amortized; an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized, but is evaluated annually for impairment. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in 20 Table of Contents distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. At December 30, 2006, intangible assets, net, were $4.9 billion, consisting primarily of goodwill and trademarks associated with the 2001 acquisition of Keebler Foods Company. Within this total, approximately $1.4 billion of non goodwill intangible assets were classified as indefinite lived, comprised principally of Keebler trademarks. While we currently believe that the fair value of all of our intangibles exceeds carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to the cash flows of the Company, materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our North American snacks business or the weighted average cost of capital used in the valuations could result in significant impairment losses and or amortization expense. Stock compensation In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R) Share Based Payment, which generally requires public companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value and to recognize this cost over the requisite service period. We adopted SFAS No. 123(R) as of the beginning of our 2006 fiscal year, using the modified prospective method. Accordingly, prior years were not restated, but our 2006 results include compensation expense associated with unvested equity based awards, which were granted prior to 2006. With the adoption of this pronouncement, stock based compensation represents a critical accounting policy of the Company, which is further described in Note 1 within Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For 2006, our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) has resulted in an increase in the Companys corporate SGA expense and a corresponding reduction to earnings and net earnings per share, due primarily to recognition of compensation expense associated with employee and director stock option grants. No such expense was recognized under our previous accounting method in pre 2006 periods; however, we were required to disclose pro forma results under the alternate fair value method prescribed by SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. Using reported results for 2006 and pro forma results for 2005, the comparable impact of stock compensation expense is presented in the following table: Stock based compensation expense Diluted EPS (millions, except per share data) Pre tax Net of tax impact 2006: As reported comparable $ 30.3 $ 19.3 $ .04 SFAS No. 123(R) adoption impact 65.4 42.4 .11 As reported total $ 95.7 $ 61.7 $ .15 2005: As reported comparable $ 18.5 $ 11.8 $ .03 Pro forma incremental 57.9 36.9 .09 Pro forma total $ 76.4 $ 48.7 $ .12 As illustrated in the preceding table, the pro forma incremental impact of stock compensation was $.09 per share for 2005 versus an $.11 impact of adopting SFAS No. 123(R) in 2006. The $.02 year over year increase in the per share impact is due principally to an increase in the number of options granted during 2006 and a lower average number of shares outstanding on which the calculation is based. As explained in the following paragraphs, the amount of stock compensation recognized for any particular year is highly dependent on market conditions and other factors outside of our control. Based on historical patterns and predicted market conditions existing at December 30, 2006, we currently expect the 2007 earnings per share impact of stock option expense to be within the range of actual 2005 and 2006 results. Accounting for stock compensation under SFAS No. 123(R) represents a critical accounting estimate, which requires significant judgments and assumptions likely to have a material impact on our financial statements. Due to the need to determine the grant date fair value of equity instruments that have not yet been awarded, the actual impact on future results will depend, in part, on actual awards during any reporting period and various market factors that affect the fair value of those awards. Additionally, while the timing and volume of grants associated with a particular years long term incentive compensation are within our control, the timing and volume of reload option grants are not. Reload options are awarded to eligible employees and directors to replace previously owned Company stock used by those individuals to pay the exercise price, including related employment taxes, of vested pre 2004 option awards containing this accelerated ownership feature. Under SFAS No. 123(R), these reload options result in additional compensation expense in the year of grant and for 2006, represented approximately one third of the Companys total stock option expense. The 21 Table of Contents Company has not granted options containing an accelerated ownership feature since 2003; however, the potential requirement to award reload options over the contractual 10 year term of the original grants could continue to significantly impact the amount of our stock based compensation expense for a number of years. We estimate the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using a lattice based option valuation model for annual grants and a Black Scholes model for reload grants. These models require us to make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, and dividend yield. Our methods for selecting these valuation assumptions are explained in Note 8 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In particular, our estimate of stock price volatility is based principally on historical volatility of the options granted, and to a lesser extent, on implied volatilities from traded options on the Companys stock. For the lattice based model, historical volatility corresponds to the 10 year contractual term of the options granted; whereas, for the Black Scholes model, historical volatility corresponds to the expected term, which is currently 2.5 years. We decided to rely more heavily on historical volatility due to the greater availability of data and reliability of trends over longer periods of time, as compared to the terms of more thinly traded options, which rarely extend beyond two years. At year end 2006, historical volatilities using weekly price observations ranged from approximately 23% for 10 years to 12% for 2.5 years. In comparison, implied volatilities averaged approximately 16% for traded options with terms in excess of six months. Based on this data, our weighted average composite volatility assumption for purposes of valuing our option grants during 2006 was 17.9%, as compared to 22.0% for 2005. All other assumptions held constant, a one percentage point increase or decrease in our 2006 volatility assumption would increase or decrease the grant date fair value of our 2006 option awards by approximately 4%. To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions, we are not required to true up grant date fair value based expense to final intrinsic values. However, these differences can impact the classification of cash tax benefits realized upon exercise of stock options, as explained in the following two paragraphs. Furthermore, as historical data has a significant bearing on our forward looking assumptions, significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions, which could then significantly impact the year over year comparability of stock based compensation expense. SFAS No. 123(R) also provides that any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings (referred to as a windfall tax benefit) will be presented in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as a financing (rather than an operating) cash flow. If this standard had been adopted in 2005, operating cash flow would have been lower (and financing cash flow would have been higher) by approximately $20 million as a result of this provision. For 2006, the corresponding reduction in operating cash flow attributable to windfall tax benefits classified as financing cash flow was $21.5 million. The actual impact on future years operating cash flow will depend, in part, on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercise date market value of the underlying stock and the original grant date fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes. For balance sheet classification purposes, realized windfall tax benefits are credited to capital in excess of par value within the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Realized shortfall tax benefits (amounts which are less than that previously recognized in earnings) are first offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits, if any, and then charged directly to income tax expense, potentially resulting in volatility in our consolidated effective income tax rate. Under the transition rules for adopting SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective method, we were permitted to calculate a cumulative memo balance of windfall tax benefits from post 1995 years for the purpose of accounting for future shortfall tax benefits. We completed such study prior to the first period of adoption and currently have sufficient cumulative memo windfall tax benefits to absorb projected arising shortfalls, such that 2007 earnings are not currently expected to be affected by this provision. However, as employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control, the likelihood exists of materially different reported results if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail. Retirement benefits Our Company sponsors a number of U.S. and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the United States and Canada. Plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations. A substantial majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of debt securities and other investments. We follow SFAS No. 87 Employers Accounting for Pensions and SFAS No. 106 Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (as amended by SFAS No. 158, effective as of our fiscal year end 2006) for the measurement and recognition of obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans. Embodied in both of these standards is 22 Table of Contents the concept that the cost of benefits provided during retirement should be recognized over the employees active working life. Inherent in this concept is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date. Major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the long term rates of return on plan assets, the health care cost trend rates, and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans, which cover employees in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. To conduct our annual review of the long term rate of return on plan assets, we work with third party financial consultants to model expected returns over a 20 year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans. The return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forward looking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on long term bonds, price earnings ratios of the major stock market indices, and long term inflation. Our U.S. plan model, corresponding to approximately 70% of our trust assets globally, currently incorporates a long term inflation assumption of 2.8% and an active management premium of 1% (net of fees) validated by historical analysis. Although we review our expected long term rates of return annually, our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. Our expected rates of return are generally not revised, provided these rates continue to fall within a more likely than not corridor of between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected long term returns, as determined by our modeling process. Our assumed rate of return for U.S. plans in 2006 of 8.9% equated to approximately the 50th percentile expectation of our 2006 model. Similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets, reflecting local economic conditions. Foreign trust investments represent approximately 30% of our global benefit plan assets. Based on consolidated benefit plan assets at December 30, 2006, a 100 basis point reduction in the assumed rate of return would increase 2007 benefits expense by approximately $42 million. Correspondingly, a 100 basis point shortfall between the assumed and actual rate of return on plan assets for 2007 would result in a similar amount of arising experience loss. Any arising asset related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated value of plan assets over a five year period. Once recognized, experience gains and losses are amortized using a declining balance method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants, which for U.S. plans is presently about 13 years. Under this recognition method, a 100 basis point shortfall in actual versus assumed performance of all of our plan assets in 2007 would reduce pre tax earnings by approximately $1 million in 2008, increasing to approximately $7 million in 2012. For each of the three years ending December 30, 2006, our actual return on plan assets exceeded the recognized assumed return by the following amounts (in millions): 2006$257.1; 2005$39.4; 2004$95.6. To conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates, we work with third party financial consultants to model our actual claims cost data over a five year historical period, including an analysis of pre 65 versus post 65 age groups and other important demographic components of our covered retiree population. This data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends. Our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding short term future trends. In comparison to our actual five year compound annual claims cost growth rate of approximately 8%, our initial trend rate for 2007 of 9.5% reflects the expected future impact of faster growing claims experience for certain demographic groups within our total employee population. Our initial rate is trended downward by 1% per year, until the ultimate trend rate of 4.75% is reached. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Based on consolidated obligations at December 30, 2006, a 100 basis point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase 2007 benefits expense by approximately $18 million. A 100 basis point excess of 2007 actual health care claims cost over that calculated from the assumed trend rate would result in an arising experience loss of approximately $9 million. Any arising health care claims cost related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated amount of claims experience over a four year period. Once recognized, experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight line method over 15 years, resulting in at least the minimum amortization prescribed by SFAS No. 106. The net experience gain arising from recognition of 2006 claims experience was approximately $6 million. 23 Table of Contents To conduct our annual review of discount rates, we use several published market indices with appropriate duration weighting to assess prevailing rates on high quality debt securities, with a primary focus on the Citigroup Pension Liability Index for our U.S. plans. To test the appropriateness of these indices, we periodically engage third party financial consultants to conduct a matching exercise between the expected settlement cash flows of our plans and bond maturities, consisting principally of AA rated (or the equivalent in foreign jurisdictions) non callable issues with at least $25 million principal outstanding. The model does not assume any reinvestment rates and assumes that bond investments mature just in time to pay benefits as they become due. For those years where no suitable bonds are available, the portfolio utilizes a linear interpolation approach to impute a hypothetical bond whose maturity matches the cash flows required in those years. As of four different interim dates during 2005 and 2006, this matching exercise for our U.S. plans produced a discount rate within +/ 15 basis points of the equivalent dated Citigroup Pension Liability Index. The measurement dates for our defined benefit plans are consistent with our Companys fiscal year end. Thus, we select discount rates to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during December of each year. Based on consolidated obligations at December 30, 2006, a 25 basis point decline in the weighted average discount rate used for benefit plan measurement purposes would increase 2007 benefits expense by approximately $17 million. All obligation related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants. Despite the previously described rigorous policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions, we periodically experience material differences between assumed and actual experience. As of December 30, 2006, we had consolidated unamortized prior service cost and net experience losses of approximately $.9 billion, as compared to approximately $1.4 billion at December 31, 2005. The year over year decline in net unamortized amounts was attributable largely to trust asset performance and the favorable impact of rising interest rates on our benefit obligations. Of the total unamortized amounts at December 30, 2006, approximately 80% was related to discount rate reductions, with the remainder primarily related to net unfavorable health care claims cost experience (including upward revisions in the assumed trend rate.) For 2007, we currently expect total amortization of prior service cost and net experience losses to be approximately $25 million lower than the actual 2006 amount of approximately $123 million. As discussed on page 14, total employee benefits expense for 2007 is expected to be approximately even with the 2006 amount, with higher active health care claims cost and postretirement service and interest cost components offsetting the lower amortization expense. Assuming actual future experience is consistent with our current assumptions, annual amortization of accumulated prior service cost and net experience losses during each of the next several years would remain approximately level with the 2007 amount. Income taxes Our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may not succeed. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. Our effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that we consider appropriate. For the periods presented, our income tax and related interest reserves have averaged approximately $150 million. Reserve adjustments for individual issues have rarely exceeded 1% of earnings before income taxes annually. Nevertheless, the accumulation of individually insignificant discrete adjustments throughout a particular year has historically impacted our consolidated effective income tax rate by up to 200 basis points. As discussed on page 16, for 2007, we believe our rate could be up to 200 basis points lower if pending uncertain tax matters, including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives, are resolved more favorably than we currently expect. For the periods presented, our policy was to establish reserves that reflected the probable outcome of known tax contingencies. Favorable resolution was recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. As compared to a contingency approach, FIN No. 48 (which we adopted at the beginning of 2007) is 24 Table of Contents based on a benefit recognition model, which we believe could result in a greater amount of benefit (and a lower amount of reserve) being initially recognized in certain circumstances. Provided that the tax position is deemed more likely than not of being sustained, FIN No. 48 permits a company to recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being ultimately realized upon settlement. The tax position must be derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained. Despite this difference in conceptual approach, we do not currently expect the adoption of FIN No. 48 to have a significant impact on the amount of benefits recognized in connection with our uncertain tax positions during 2007. The current portion of our tax reserves is presented in the balance sheet within accrued income taxes and the amount expected to be settled after one year is recorded in other noncurrent liabilities. Significant tax reserve adjustments impacting our effective tax rate would be separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of Note 11 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Future Outlook Our 2007 forecasted consolidated results are generally based on our long term annual growth targets as discussed on page 11, although we currently expect our internal net sales could increase as much as four percent, slightly exceeding our low single digit growth target. We expect this higher than targeted growth to come principally from continued category expansion in Latin America and strong innovation performance in North America. Despite a projected decline in gross margin of up to 50 basis points, we believe the higher than targeted sales growth will support mid single digit consolidated operating profit growth. As discussed on page 15, net interest expense for 2007 is expected to be approximately even with 2006 results and our consolidated effective income tax rate could be lower than the 2006 rate of approximately 32%. These two factors are expected to provide leverage for purposes of achieving our target of high single digit growth in 2007 net earnings per share. In addition, we remain committed to reinvesting in brand building, cost reduction initiatives, and other growth opportunities. Lastly, we expect our cash flow performance to remain strong and are currently targeting a level of $950 $1,025 million for 2007. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our Company is exposed to certain market risks, which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations. We use derivative financial and commodity instruments, where appropriate, to manage these risks. As a matter of policy, we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions. Refer to Note 12 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our accounting policies related to derivative financial and commodity instruments. Foreign exchange risk Our Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related to third party purchases, intercompany loans and product shipments, and nonfunctional currency denominated third party debt. Our Company is also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments. Additionally, our Company is exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency earnings to U.S. Dollars. Primary exposures include the U.S. Dollar versus the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, and Mexican Peso, and in the case of inter subsidiary transactions, the British Pound versus the Euro. We assess foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational volatility and enter into forward contracts, options, and currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in net long or short currency positions. Forward contracts and options are generally less than 18 months duration. Currency swap agreements are established in conjunction with the term of underlying debt issuances. The total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at year end 2006 was $455 million, representing a settlement obligation of $1 million. The total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at year end 2005 was $467 million, representing a settlement obligation of $22 million. All of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions, translational exposure, or existing assets or liabilities, and mature within 18 months. Assuming an unfavorable 10% change in year end exchange rates, the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately $46 million at year end 2006 and $47 million at year end 2005. These unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures. 25 Table of Contents Interest rate risk Our Company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future issuances of variable rate debt. Primary exposures include movements in U.S. Treasury rates, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), and commercial paper rates. We periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs associated with certain debt issues, and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt, based on current and projected market conditions. Note 7 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides information on our significant debt issues. There were no interest rate derivatives outstanding at year end 2006 and 2005. Assuming average variable rate debt levels during the year, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by approximately $20 million in 2006 and $9 million in 2005. Price risk Our Company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials, fuel, and energy. Primary exposures include corn, wheat, soybean oil, sugar, cocoa, paperboard, natural gas, and diesel fuel. We have historically used the combination of long term contracts with suppliers, and exchange traded futures and option contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted raw material purchases over a duration of generally less than 18 months. During 2006, we entered into two separate 10 year over the counter commodity swap transactions to reduce fluctuations in the price of natural gas used principally in its manufacturing processes. The notional amount of the swaps totaled approximately $209 million, which currently equates to approximately 50% of our North America manufacturing needs. The total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at year end 2006, including the natural gas swaps, was $239 million, representing a settlement obligation of approximately $11 million. Assuming a 10% decrease in year end commodity prices, the settlement obligation would increase by approximately $17 million, generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases. The total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at year end 2005 was $22 million, representing a settlement receivable of approximately $1 million. Assuming a 10% decrease in year end commodity prices, this settlement receivable would convert to an obligation of approximately $1 million, generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying material purchases. In addition to the derivative commodity instruments discussed above, we use long term contracts with suppliers to manage a portion of the price exposure. It should be noted that the exclusion of these positions from the analysis above could be a limitation in assessing the net market risk of our Company. 26 Table of Contents
