ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Kellogg Company and Subsidiaries RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand Kellogg Company, our operations and our present business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item 8 of this report. Kellogg Company is the worlds leading producer of cereal and a leading producer of convenience foods, including cookies, crackers, toaster pastries, cereal bars, fruit snacks, frozen waffles, and veggie foods. Kellogg products are manufactured and marketed globally. We currently manage our operations in four geographic operating segments, comprised of North America and the three International operating segments of Europe, Latin America, and Asia Pacific. We manage our Company for sustainable performance defined by our long term annual growth targets. These targets are low single digit (1 to 3%) for internal net sales, mid single digit (4 to 6%) for internal operating profit, and high single digit (7 to 9%) for diluted net earnings per share (EPS) on a currency neutral basis. See Foreign currency translation section for our definition of currency neutral EPS. For our full year 2009, we were at the high end of our long term annual net sales target with internal growth of 3%. On a reported basis, net sales declined by 2%. Consolidated internal operating profit increased 10%, exceeding our long term annual growth target. Reported operating profit grew 2%. Diluted EPS grew 13% on a currency neutral basis, exceeding our long term annual growth target of 7 to 9%. Reported EPS was $3.16, an increase of 6% over last years $2.99. Consolidated results (dollars in millions, except per share data) 2009 2008 2007 Net sales $ 12,575 $ 12,822 $ 11,776 Net sales growth: As reported 1.9% 8.9% 8.0% Internal (a) 3.0% 5.4% 5.4% Operating profit $ 2,001 $ 1,953 $ 1,868 Operating profit growth: As reported 2.5% 4.5% 5.8% Internal (a) 10.3% 4.2% 3.1% Diluted net earnings per share (EPS) $ 3.16 $ 2.99 $ 2.76 EPS growth 6% 8% 10% Currency neutral diluted EPS growth (b) 13% 8% 7% (a) Internal net sales and operating profit for 2009 exclude the impact of currency and acquisitions. Internal net sales and operating profit growth for 2008 exclude the impact of currency, a 53rd shipping week and acquisitions. Internal net sales and operating profit for 2007 excludes the impact of currency. Internal net sales and operating profit growth is a non GAAP financial measure which is further discussed and reconciled to GAAP basis growth on page 16. (b) See the section entitled Foreign currency translation for discussion and reconciliation of the non GAAP financial measure. In combination with an attractive dividend yield, we believe this profitable growth has and will continue to provide a strong total return to our shareholders. We believe we can achieve this sustainable growth through a strategy focused on growing our cereal business, expanding our snacks business, and pursuing selected growth opportunities. We support our business strategy with operating principles that emphasize profit rich, sustainable sales growth, as well as cash flow and return on invested capital. We believe our steady earnings growth, strong cash flow, and continued investment during a multi year period of economic uncertainty demonstrates the strength and flexibility of our business model. 13 Net sales and operating profit 2009 compared to 2008 The following table provides an analysis of net sales and operating profit performance for 2009 versus 2008: (dollars in millions) NorthAmerica Europe LatinAmerica Asia Pacific (a) Corporate Consolidated 2009 net sales $8,510 $ 2,361 $ 963 $ 741 $ $12,575 2008 net sales $8,457 $ 2,619 $ 1,030 $ 716 $ $12,822 % change 2009 vs. 2008: Volume (tonnage) (b) .7% 1.6% 1.2% 1.3% .7% Pricing/mix 3.5% 3.2% 5.6% 6.3% 3.7% Subtotal internal business 2.8% 1.6% 6.8% 5.0% 3.0% Acquisitions (c) .1% .3% 3.7% .3% Shipping day differences (d) 1.8% 1.1% .5% .9% 1.5% Foreign currency impact .5% 10.6% 12.9% 4.3% 3.7% Total change .6% 9.8% 6.6% 3.5% 1.9% (dollars in millions) NorthAmerica Europe LatinAmerica Asia Pacific (a) Corporate Consolidated 2009 operating profit $1,569 $ 348 $ 179 $ 86 $(181 ) $ 2,001 2008 operating profit $1,447 $ 390 $ 209 $ 92 $(185 ) $ 1,953 % change 2009 vs. 2008: Internal business 11.4% 7.0% 2.0% 13.5% 10.3% Acquisitions (c) 8.4% .4% Shipping day differences (d) 2.4% 1.3% .9% .8% 1.8% 1.8% Foreign currency impact .5% 16.5% 13.1% 10.5% 5.6% Total change 8.5% 10.8% 14.2% 6.2% 1.8% 2.5% (a) Includes Australia, Asia and South Africa. (b) We measure the volume impact (tonnage) on revenues based on the stated weight of our product shipments. (c) Impact of results for the year to date period ended January 2, 2010 from the acquisitions of United Bakers, Navigable Foods, Specialty Cereal and certain assets and liabilities of IndyBake. (d) Impact of 53rd shipping week in 2008. Our consolidated reported net sales were down compared to last year, driven by a negative impact from foreign currency translation and an extra shipping week in 2008. Excluding this negative impact, internal net sales grew by 3%, lapping last years strong 5% growth. While our overall volume declined, we achieved internal sales growth driven by a particularly strong year in retail cereal and a solid year in retail snacks resulting from our pricing and mix. There were several factors contributing to the volume decline. In North America, we experienced a supply disruption in our waffle plants. In both Russia and China we are moving our businesses away from lower margin products and going to higher margin branded products which resulted in a decline in volume during the year. Our North America operating segment had internal net sales growth of almost 3% against a difficult 6% comparative in the year ago period. We experienced growth in retail cereal of 4% and 3% growth in retail snacks, which includes cookies, crackers, toaster pastries, cereal bars and fruit snacks. Weakness in frozen and specialty channels, which includes frozen foods, food service and vending, dampened net sales for the year, with a decline in net sales of 1%. Cereal continues to be a strong category where we achieved volume growth during the year. It responds well to innovation and advertising. We are committed to providing nutritious food to our consumers and introduced Froot Loops&reg; and Apple Jacks&reg; with fiber in August of 2009. Our business is focused on driving our top 8 brands as well as Kashi&reg; cereals. We experienced broad based growth in retail snacks, with sales growth of 3%. Pop Tarts&reg; continues to perform well and is the category leader in North America toaster pastries. A strong performance by Cheez It&reg;, as well as innovation, drove growth in crackers. Cookies posted a slight gain for the year led by our recently acquired Mothers&reg; brand cookies. Our growth was negatively impacted by heavy competitor activity. Our best performing category within retail snacks was wholesome snacks. The introduction of Fiber Plus&reg;, Special K&reg; Chocolaty Pretzel and Cinnabon&reg; bars drove growth in this category Our frozen and specialty channels business was down 1%, experiencing a tough year due to a few discrete issues. Our food service business is mostly non commercial, serving institutions such as schools, hospitals and prisons. This sector of the industry was not immediately impacted by the economic downturn that started in 2008. While we are seeing a recovery, we believe it will be slower than the commercial sectors such and hotels and restaurants, continuing to impact us until mid 2010. We have also been experiencing a supply disruption in our waffle facilities. We have been making improvements in our facilities and are working with regulatory agencies. A combination of extensive enhancements and repairs at our facilities and a flood at one facility, significantly impacted production in the second half of the year. While our plants are operational, they are not running at their previous level of capacity. Demand continues to exceed supply. We are exploring ways to increase capacity, including investing additional capital, but expect this situation will impact our net sales in 2010. This impact is included in our 2010 guidance. Our International operating segments collectively achieved net sales growth of 3% on an internal basis. Europes internal net sales increased 2% year over year. Europe was a tough environment for us in 2009. We encountered some retailer disputes earlier in the year that were resolved in the second half of the year, helping us to achieve cereal volume growth. Latin Americas internal net sales growth was 7% attributable to both volume and price increases driven by retail cereal in Mexico and Venezuela. Internal net sales in Asia Pacific grew 5%, driven by strong cereal performances in Australia and India. Our consolidated operating profit was strong, increasing by 10% on an internal basis and by 2% on a reported basis. Reported operating profit in each of our operating segments was negatively impacted by foreign exchange as well as the absence of a 53 rd week in 2009. In 2009, we continued to experience cost 14 pressures, increased our spending on up front costs, and invested in advertising. We were able to more than offset these increased costs by savings from our cost reduction and productivity initiatives as well as pricing and mix. During the full year of 2009, our up front costs were $138 million, which were $63 million higher than the previous year. Up front costs represent both exit or disposal activities as well as other cost reduction initiatives. North Americas internal operating profit growth of 11% was driven by price and savings from our cost reduction initiatives, which was partially offset by significantly higher up front costs and increased advertising. Up front costs reduced North Americas operating profit by 4%. Europes internal operating profit increased 7% benefiting from media deflation and operating efficiencies while absorbing higher up front costs which reduced operating profit by 3%. Internal operating profit decreased 2% in Latin America due to significantly higher material costs and increased advertising. Internal operating profit growth in Asia Pacific was 14% due to sales growth, while reported operating profit was negatively impacted by the acquisition of Navigable Foods. For further information on our acquisitions, see Note 2 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 2008 compared to 2007 The following tables provide an analysis of net sales and operating profit performance for 2008 versus 2007: (dollars in millions) NorthAmerica Europe LatinAmerica AsiaPacific (a) Corporate Consolidated 2008 net sales $ 8,457 $ 2,619 $ 1,030 $ 716 $ $ 12,822 2007 net sales $ 7,786 $ 2,357 $ 984 $ 649 $ $ 11,776 % change 2008 vs. 2007: Volume (tonnage) (b) 1.3% .2% 2.6% 6.3% .9% Pricing/mix 4.5% 3.9% 6.9% 1.8% 4.5% Subtotal internal business 5.8% 3.7% 4.3% 8.1% 5.4% Acquisitions (c) .9% 5.5% 3.4% 1.8% Shipping day differences (d) 1.9% 1.2% .5% 1.0% 1.7% Foreign currency impact .7% .1% 2.2% Total change 8.6% 11.1% 4.7% 10.3% 8.9% (dollars in millions) NorthAmerica Europe LatinAmerica AsiaPacific (a) Corporate Consolidated 2008 operating profit $ 1,447 $ 390 $ 209 $ 92 $ (185 ) $ 1,953 2007 operating profit $ 1,345 $ 397 $ 213 $ 88 $ (175 ) $ 1,868 % change 2008 vs. 2007: Internal business 5.9% .6% 1.5% 11.0% 2.8% 4.2% Acquisitions (c) .8% .6% 6.2% 1.0% Shipping day differences (d) 2.5% 1.2% .9% .8% 1.9% 1.8% Foreign currency impact .1% 1.9% .4% 1.8% .5% Total change 7.5% 1.9% 2.0% 3.8% 4.7% 4.5% (a) Includes Australia, Asia and South Africa. (b) We measure the volume impact (tonnage) on revenues based on the stated weight of our product shipments. (c) Impact of results for the year to date period ended January 3, 2009 from the acquisitions of United Bakers, Bear Naked, Navigable Foods, Specialty Cereals and certain assets and liabilities of the Wholesome & Hearty Foods Company and IndyBake. (d) Impact of 53rd shipping week in 2008. During 2008, our consolidated reported net sales increased almost 9% driven by our North America business with increases in both volume and price/mix for the year. Internal net sales grew over 5%, building on a 5% rate of internal growth during 2007. We had a fifty third week in our 2008 fiscal year which contributed almost 2% to our reported growth over the prior year as did our acquisitions. Management has estimated the pro forma effect on the Companys results of operations as though these business combinations had been completed at the beginning of either 2008 or 2007 would have been immaterial. Successful innovation, brand building (advertising and consumer promotion) investment as well as our price increases continued to drive growth. Declines in volume in both Europe and Latin America were more than offset by growth in pricing/mix due to our price increases. Asia Pacific had a particularly strong year experiencing growth of 8% driven by cereal sales across the operating segment. For 2008, our North America operating segment reported a net sales increase of almost 9% with internal net sales growth of 6%. The growth was broad based and driven by our price realization and strong innovation. The major product brands grew as follows: retail cereal +3%; retail snacks (cookies, crackers, toaster pastries, cereal bars, and fruit snacks) +6%; frozen and specialty channels (frozen foods, food service and vending) +9%. While retail cereal grew 3% for the year, we had a relatively soft share performance in the fourth quarter facing aggressive price based incentives from our competitors. In addition, while we estimate our consumption was up 2% across all channels, reductions in trade inventory also adversely affected shipments. As a result, our fourth quarter internal net sales declined by 3% which was up against a tough comparable of 8% growth in the prior year. Our snacks business grew 6% in 2008 on top of 7% growth last year. Our growth came from volume, price increases, and successful innovations such as Townhouse Flipsides and Cheez It Duoz. We saw net sales growth in all product categories toaster pastries, crackers, cookies and wholesome snacks. Our Right Bites 100 calorie cookie and cracker packs performed well as we saw an increase in demand for portion controlled portable food. Our frozen and specialty channels business grew over 9%. Our food service business performed well, achieving mid single digit growth for the year. Frozen realized strong sales driven by innovations such as Bake Shop Swirlz, Mini Muffin Tops and French Toast Waffles. Our International operating segments collectively achieved net sales growth of 9%, or 5% on an internal basis. Europes internal net sales grew by almost 4% attributable to price/mix, as volume was down slightly. The UK and continental Europe have been impacted by the economic crisis which had consumers searching for value and retailers reducing inventory. Snacks products performed well across the 15 region, especially in the UK driven by Rice Krispies Squares. Latin Americas internal net sales growth was 4% attributable to our price increases and driven by cereal sales in Mexico and Venezuela. The growth in 2008 was on top of 2007 growth of 9%. Volume was down for 2008 due to the economic environment which impacted consumer confidence. Asia Pacific had a very strong year with 8% internal net sales growth. The growth was volume driven and broad based in both retail cereal and retail snacks. Consolidated operating profit in 2008 grew by almost 5% on an as reported basis and 4% on an internal basis. Operating profit in all areas was impacted by cost pressures as discussed in more detail in the Margin performance section below. North America grew by 6% driven by growth in net sales and lower exit costs which offset higher commodity costs. Costs associated with the peanut related recall of Kellogg products adversely impacted North Americas operating profit by $34 million or 2% of the full year operating profit. See the Voluntary product withdrawal section for more details. Operating profit declined slightly in both Europe and Latin America due to increased commodity costs and cost reduction initiatives. Asia Pacifics operating profit increased 11% on an internal basis due to strong top line growth. On a consolidated basis, operating profit from acquisitions decreased internal operating profit by 1%, in line with our expectations, with Europe and Asia Pacific being particularly impacted by our Russian and Chinese acquisitions, respectively. Margin performance Margin performance was as follows: Change vs.prior year(pts.) 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 Gross margin (a) 42.9% 41.9% 44.0% 1.0 (2.1 ) SGA% (b) 27.0% 26.7% 28.1% (.3 ) 1.4 Operating margin 15.9% 15.2% 15.9% .7 (.7 ) (a) Gross profit as a percentage of net sales. Gross profit is equal to net sales less cost of goods sold. (b) Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales. We strive for gross profit dollar growth to reinvest in brand building and innovation expenditures. We maximize our gross profit dollars by managing external cost pressures through product pricing and mix improvements, implementing productivity savings and technological initiatives as well as entering into commodity hedges and fixed price contracts to reduce the cost of product ingredients and packaging. For full year 2009, our gross profit was up $24 million, despite the negative impact of foreign exchange of $213 million and $46 million of higher up front costs in cost of goods sold (COGS). As illustrated in the preceding table, our consolidated gross margin increased by 100 basis points in 2009. Our acquisitions lowered gross margin by approximately 10 basis points. Although moderating, we also continue to experience inflationary cost pressures for fuel, energy, commodities and employee benefits. During the year, higher costs, including increased investment in up front costs recorded in COGS, were more than offset by savings from cost reduction initiatives and price increases. Our selling, general and administrative (SGA) expense as a percentage of net sales increased slightly due to higher up front costs of $17 million recorded in overhead as well as an increase in advertising spend. Our decline in gross margin for 2008 reflected the impact of significant cost pressure with higher costs for commodities, energy, and fuel being partially offset by the impact of cost reduction initiatives and increased pricing. For 2008, these cost pressures represented 10% of 2007s COGS, primarily associated with our ingredient purchases. In 2008, acquisitions negatively impacted margin by 50 basis points. For 2008, our SGA% decreased over the prior year due to our strong net sales growth, lower expense related to cost reduction initiatives recorded in SGA expense, continued discipline in overhead spending and efficiencies in advertising and promotion. Foreign currency translation The reporting currency for our financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of our assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily in the euro, British pound, Mexican peso, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates. As a result, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. This could have significant impact on our results if such increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar is substantial. Due to potential volatility in the foreign exchange markets, we measure EPS growth and provide guidance on a currency neutral basis, assuming earnings are translated at the prior years exchange rates. This non GAAP financial measure is being used to focus management and investors on local currency business results, thereby providing visibility to the underlying trends of the Company. Management believes that excluding the impact of foreign currency from EPS provides a better measurement of comparability given the volatility in foreign exchange markets. 16 Below is a reconciliation of reported EPS to currency neutral EPS for the fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007: Consolidated results 2009 2008 2007 Diluted net earnings per share (EPS) $ 3.16 $ 2.99 $ 2.76 Translational impact (a) 0.22 (0.07 ) Currency neutral EPS $ 3.38 $ 2.99 $ 2.69 Currency neutral EPS growth (b) 13% 8% 7% (a) Translation impact is the difference between reported EPS and the translation of current year net profits at prior year exchange rates, adjusted for gains (losses) on translational hedges. (b) Calculated as a percentage of growth from the prior years reported EPS. Exit or disposal activities We view our continued spending on cost reduction initiatives as part of our ongoing operating principles to provide greater visibility in achieving our long term profit growth targets. Initiatives undertaken are currently expected to recover cash implementation costs within a five year period of completion. Upon completion (or as each major stage is completed in the case of multi year programs), the project begins to deliver cash savings and or reduced depreciation. Certain of these initiatives represent exit or disposal plans for which material charges will be incurred. We include these charges in our measure of operating segment profitability. Management announced its intention to achieve $1 billion of annual cost savings in three years (beginning in 2012). These initiatives are integral to meeting our $1 billion savings challenge. Refer to Note 3 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on our exit or disposal activities. Other cost reduction initiatives 2009 activities We incurred costs related to our cost reduction initiatives which do not qualify as exit costs under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. These represent cash costs for consulting and other charges for our COGS and SGA programs. Costs incurred in fiscal year 2009 as well as total program costs are as follows (in millions): (millions) For the year ended January 2, 2010 Total program costs through January 2, 2010 COGSprograms SGAPrograms Total COGS programs SGA Programs Total North America $ 38 $ 13 $ 51 $ 50 $ 13 $ 63 Europe 10 2 12 10 2 12 Latin America 5 5 5 5 Asia Pacific 5 5 5 5 Total $ 58 $ 15 $ 73 $ 70 $ 15 $ 85 The additional cost and cash outlay in 2010 for these programs, excluding exit costs, is estimated to be $30 to $35 million. Prior year activities During 2008, we incurred $17 million of expense related to the elimination of the accelerated ownership feature of certain employee stock options. Refer to Note 7 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This expense was recorded in SGA expense within corporate operating profit. We also incurred $10 million of expense during 2008 in connection with a payment for the restructuring of our labor force at a manufacturing facility in Mexico. The cost, which was recorded in COGS and was attributable to the Latin America operating segment, resulted in employee benefit cost savings. Interest expense As illustrated in the following table, annual interest expense for the 2007 2009 periods has trended down slightly. The decline in 2009 was due primarily to lower commercial paper balances during the year, the impact of our fixed to variable interest rate swaps on our long term debt and lower commercial paper interest rates, partially offset by the costs of early redemption of long term debt, and interest on long term debt issued in 2009. Interest income (recorded in other income (expense), net) was (in millions), 2009 $4; 2008 $20; 2007 $23. The decline for 2009 was primarily due to a drop in average interest rates. We currently expect that our 2010 gross interest expense will be approximately $250 to $260 million. Change vs. prior year (dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 Reported interest expense (a) $ 295 $ 308 $ 319 Amounts capitalized 3 6 5 Gross interest expense $ 298 $ 314 $ 324 5.1% 3.1% (a) Reported interest expense for 2009 and 2007 includes charges of approximately $35 and $5, respectively, related to the early redemption of long term debt. Other income (expense), net Refer to Note 15 within to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Income taxes Our long term objective is to achieve a consolidated effective income tax rate of approximately 30% in comparison to a U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 35%. We pursue planning initiatives globally in order to move toward our target. Excluding the impact of discrete adjustments and the cost of remitted and unremitted foreign earnings, our sustainable consolidated effective income tax rate for 2009 was 30%. For 2008 and 2007, it was 31% and 32% respectively. We currently expect our 2010 sustainable rate to be approximately 31%. Our reported rates of 28.2% for 2009, 29.7% for 2008 and 28.7% for 2007 were lower than the sustainable 17 rates for those years due to the favorable effect of various discrete adjustments such as audit settlements, international restructuring initiatives and statutory rate changes. Refer to Note 10 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. For 2010, we expect our consolidated effective income tax rate to be approximately 30% to 31%. This could be impacted if pending uncertain tax matters, including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives, are resolved more or less favorably than we currently expect. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could also impact the effective tax rate as it is dependent upon the U.S. dollar earnings of foreign subsidiaries doing business in various countries with differing statutory tax rates. Voluntary product withdrawal Refer to Note 13 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions. Our cash generating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs. We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our credit facilities and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that volatility and or disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Operating activities The principal source of our operating cash flow is net earnings, meaning cash receipts from the sale of our products, net of costs to manufacture and market our products. Our cash conversion cycle (defined as days of inventory and trade receivables outstanding less days of trade payables outstanding, based on a trailing 12 month average) is relatively short, equating to approximately 23 days for 2009, 22 days for 2008, and 24 days for 2007. The increase in 2009 was the result of a decrease in days of trade payables outstanding, while the decrease in 2008 was the result of a decrease in days of inventory outstanding. The following table presents the major components of our operating cash flow: (dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Operating activities Net income $ 1,208 $ 1,146 $ 1,102 year over year change 5.4% 4.0% Items in net income not requiring (providing) cash: Depreciation and amortization 384 375 372 Deferred income taxes (40 ) 157 (69 ) Other 13 121 184 Net income after non cash items 1,565 1,799 1,589 year over year change 13.0% 13.2% Pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions (100 ) (451 ) (96 ) Changes in operating assets and liabilities: Core working capital (a) (147 ) 121 16 Other working capital 325 (202 ) (6 ) Total 178 (81 ) 10 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,643 $ 1,267 $ 1,503 year over year change 29.7% 15.7% (a) Inventory, trade receivables and trade payables. Our net cash provided by operating activities for 2009 was $376 million higher than in 2008, due primarily to positive cash flows associated with other working capital and lower pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions, partially offset by the impact of changes in core working capital and deferred income taxes in 2009. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2008 was $236 million lower than 2007, due primarily to the increase in pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions in 2008 and an unfavorable year over year variance in other working capital. Partially offsetting the decrease in 2008 operating cash flows was the impact of changes in deferred income taxes and a favorable variance in core working capital. In 2009, core working capital was an average of 6.5% of net sales, an increase of 0.3% compared with 2008. In 2008, core working capital was an average of 6.2% of net sales, an improvement of 0.6% compared with 2007. We manage core working capital through timely collection of accounts receivable, extending terms on accounts payable and careful monitoring of inventory. In 2009, the favorable year over year variance in other working capital was largely attributable to income taxes and advertising and promotion. Other working capital in 2008 reflected an increase in cash paid associated with hedging programs, cash paid for advertising and promotion, and the impact of changes in accrued salaries and wages. Our total pension and postretirement plan funding amounted to $100 million, $451 million and $96 million, in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. During 2008, adverse conditions in the equity markets caused 18 the actual rate of return on our pension and postretirement plan assets to be significantly below our assumed long term rate of return of 8.9%. As a result, we decided to make additional contributions to our pension and postretirement plans amounting to $400 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The Pension Protection Act (PPA), and subsequent regulations, determines defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements in the United States. We believe that we will not be required to make any contributions under PPA requirements until 2013. Our projections concerning timing of PPA funding requirements are subject to change primarily based on general market conditions affecting trust asset performance, future discount rates based on average yields of high grade corporate bonds and our future decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the PPA. We currently project that we will make total U.S. and foreign plan contributions in 2010 of approximately $50 million. Actual 2010 contributions could be different from our current projections, as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities, future changes in government requirements, trust asset performance, renewals of union contracts, or higher than expected health care claims cost experience. We measure cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions. We use this non GAAP financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment, dividend distributions, acquisition opportunities, and share repurchases. Our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measure, as follows: (dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,643 $ 1,267 $ 1,503 Additions to properties (377 ) (461 ) (472 ) Cash flow $ 1,266 $ 806 $ 1,031 year over year change 57.1% 21.8% Changes in cash flow (as defined) for 2009 and 2008 were primarily attributable to the additional $400 million in pension contributions we made in the fourth quarter of 2008 and lower capital expenditures 2009. For 2010, we are expecting cash flow (as defined) to be comparable to 2009. We expect to achieve our target principally through operating profit growth, and continued prudent management of our working capital. Investing activities Our net cash used in investing activities for 2009 amounted to $370 million, a decrease of $311 million compared with 2008. Net cash used in investing activities of $681 million in 2008 increased by $80 million compared with 2007. The reduction in cash used in investing activities in 2009 was attributable mainly to the reduction in business acquisition activity in 2009, and to a lesser extent, it also reflected lower capital spending. During 2008, we used cash to expand our platform for future growth with acquisitions in Russia, China, the U.S. and Australia. During 2007, we completed two business acquisitions in order to support the continued growth of our North America operating segment. Acquisitions are discussed in Note 2 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash paid for additions to properties as a percentage of net sales amounted to 3.0% in 2009, 3.6% in 2008, and 4.0% in 2007. In 2009, we spent capital for a new facility to manufacture ready to eat cereal in Mexico and completed the expansion of the global research center located in Battle Creek, Michigan, the W. K. Kellogg Institute for Food and Nutrition Research. The investment in our global research center, which began in 2008, reflects our commitment to innovation which is a key driver to the growth of our business. In 2008, we also incurred construction costs to increase manufacturing capacity in Europe. In 2007, we also increased capacity, including the purchase of a previously leased snacks manufacturing facility in Chicago, Illinois. We continue to expect our Kelloggs lean, efficient, and agile network (K LEAN) manufacturing efficiency initiative to result in a trend toward lower capital spending. Going forward, our long term target for capital spending is between 3.0% and 4.0% of net sales. Our 2010 capital plan projects spending of $500 million, which is at the high end of our 3.0% to 4.0% range. This is driven by a significant investment in our information technology infrastructure as we reinstall and upgrade our SAP platform. We also have plans to expand our manufacturing capacity in 2010, primarily for Eggo&reg; waffles in the U.S. Financing activities Our net cash used in financing activities for 2009, 2008 and 2007 amounted to $1,182 million, $780 million, and $788 million, respectively. Total debt was $4.9 billion at year end 2009 and $5.5 billion at year end 2008. The reduction in total debt, primarily commercial paper, resulted from purchasing fewer shares of our stock in 2009 compared to 2008. In November 2009, we issued $500 million of ten year 4.15% fixed rate U.S. Dollar Notes, and used proceeds of $496 million to retire a portion of our 6.6% U.S. Dollar Notes due 2011. We retired $482 million 19 of the 2011 debt through a tender offer, which resulted in $35 million of interest expense and an acceleration of $3 million loss on an interest rate swap, which was previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. These charges were included in cash flows from operating activities. This debt had an effective interest rate of 7.08%. In May 2009, we issued $750 million of seven year 4.45% fixed rate U.S. Dollar Notes, and used proceeds of $745 million to pay down commercial paper. In May 2009, we also entered into interest rate swaps on $1,150 million of our debt. Interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $750 million effectively converted our 5.125% U.S. Dollar Notes due 2012 from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation for the remainder of the five year term. In addition, interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $400 million effectively converted a portion of our 6.6% U.S. Dollar Notes due 2011 from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation for the remaining term. In March 2008, we issued $750 million of five year 4.25% fixed rate U.S. Dollar Notes under an existing shelf registration statement. We used proceeds of $746 million from issuance of this long term debt to retire a portion of our commercial paper. In conjunction with this debt issuance, we entered into interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $750 million, which effectively converted this debt from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation for the duration of the five year term. In 2008, we had cash outflows of $465 million in connection with the repayment of five year U.S. Dollar Notes at maturity in June 2008. That debt had an effective interest rate of 3.35%. In February 2007, we redeemed Euro Notes for $728 million. To partially finance this redemption, we established a program to issue euro commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $750 million or its equivalent in alternative currencies. In December 2007, the Company issued $750 million of five year 5.125% fixed rate U.S. Dollar Notes under the existing shelf registration statement, using the proceeds to replace a portion of our U.S. commercial paper. Our Board of Directors authorized stock repurchases of up to $650 million for 2009. During 2009, we spent $187 million to purchase approximately 4 million shares of common stock. The unused portion of the 2009 authorization, amounting to $463 million, was rolled over and is available to be executed against in 2010. The Board of Directors has authorized an additional stock repurchase program of up to $650 million bringing the total 2010 stock repurchase authorization to $1,113 million. During 2008 and 2007, we repurchased $650 million of our common stock each year under programs authorized by our Board of Directors. The number of shares repurchased amounted to approximately 13 million and 12 million shares, respectively, in 2008 and 2007. A separate $500 million share repurchase authorization received Board approval in third quarter 2008. We made no share repurchases under this authorization because we decided to use cash to fund pension plans and reduce commercial paper in the fourth quarter of 2008. The $500 million share repurchase authorization was later canceled. We paid quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling $1.43 per share in 2009, $1.30 per share in 2008 and $1.202 per share in 2007. Total cash paid for dividends increased by 10.3% in 2009 and 4.2% in 2008. Our objective is to maintain our dividend pay out ratio between 40% and 50% of reported net earnings. Our long term debt agreements contain customary covenants that limit the Company and some of its subsidiaries from incurring certain liens or from entering into certain sale and lease back transactions. Some agreements also contain change in control provisions. However, they do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings. A change in the Companys credit ratings could limit our access to the U.S. short term debt market and or increase the cost of refinancing long term debt in the future. However, even under these circumstances, we would continue to have access to our Five Year Credit Agreement, which expires in 2011, under which we can borrow up to $2.0 billion on a revolving credit basis. This source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis, although we do not currently plan to use it. During the third quarter of 2008 and thereafter, capital and credit markets, including commercial paper markets, experienced increased instability and disruption as the U.S. and global economies underwent a period of extreme uncertainty. Throughout this period of uncertainty, we continued to have access to the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper markets. Our commercial paper and term debt credit ratings have not been affected by the changes in the credit environment, and the amount of our total debt outstanding remained relatively flat over the past three years. We monitor the financial strength of our third party financial institutions, including those that hold our cash and cash equivalents as well as those who serve as counterparties to our credit facilities, our derivative financial instruments, and other arrangements. We continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future, while still meeting our operational needs, including the pursuit of selected bolt on acquisitions. This will be accomplished through our strong cash flow, our short term borrowings, and our maintenance of credit facilities on a global basis. 20 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Off balance sheet arrangements As of January 2, 2010 and January 3, 2009 the Company did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements. Contractual obligations The following table summarizes future estimated cash payments to be made under existing contractual obligations. Further information on debt obligations is contained in Note 6 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Further information on lease obligations is contained in Note 5. Further information on uncertain tax positions is contained in Note 10. Contractual obligations Payments due by period (millions) Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 andbeyond Long term debt: Principal $ 4,809 $ 1 $ 946 $ 751 $ 752 $ 8 $ 2,351 Interest (a) 2,450 234 219 211 144 136 1,506 Capital leases 6 2 1 1 1 1 Operating leases 604 141 122 91 66 51 133 Purchase obligations (b) 628 534 50 22 7 6 9 Uncertain tax positions (c) 35 35 Other long term (d) 1,002 105 93 60 95 254 395 Total $ 9,534 $ 1,052 $ 1,431 $ 1,136 $ 1,065 $ 455 $ 4,395 (a) Includes interest payments on long term fixed rate debt. (b) Purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments under various co marketing agreements and to a lesser extent, of service agreements, and contracts for future delivery of commodities, packaging materials, and equipment. The amounts presented in the table do not include items already recorded in accounts payable or other current liabilities at year end 2009, nor does the table reflect cash flows we are likely to incur based on our plans, but are not obligated to incur. Therefore, it should be noted that the exclusion of these items from the table could be a limitation in assessing our total future cash flows under contracts. (c) In addition to the $35 million reported in the 2010 column and classified as a current liability, the Company has $98 million recorded in long term liabilities for which it is not reasonably possible to predict when it may be paid. (d) Other long term contractual obligations are those associated with noncurrent liabilities recorded within the Consolidated Balance Sheet at year end 2009 and consist principally of projected commitments under deferred compensation arrangements, multiemployer plans, and supplemental employee retirement benefits. The table also includes our current estimate of minimum contributions to defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans through 2015 as follows: 2010 $47; 2011 $53; 2012 $36; 2013 $77; 2014 $240; 2015 $226. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Promotional expenditures Our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities such as in store displays and events, feature price discounts, consumer coupons, contests and loyalty programs. The costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded, which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure. The recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer. These estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs. Differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally insignificant and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. On a full year basis, these subsequent period adjustments have rarely represented more than 0.3% of our Companys net sales. However, our Companys total promotional expenditures (including amounts classified as a revenue reduction) represented approximately 40% of 2009 net sales; therefore, it is likely that our results would be materially different if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail. Goodwill and other intangible assets We perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually during the fourth quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual budgeting process. Goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit with associated goodwill. Carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units. For the 2009 goodwill impairment test, the fair value of the reporting units was estimated based on market multiples. Our 21 approach employs market multiples based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and earnings for companies comparable to our reporting units. Management believes the assumptions used for the impairment test are consistent with those utilized by a market participant performing similar valuations for our reporting units. Similarly, impairment testing of other intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset. Fair values of non goodwill intangible assets are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset. For instance, cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales discounted at rates consistent with rates used by market participants. These estimates are made using various inputs including historical data, current and anticipated market conditions, management plans, and market comparables. We also evaluate the useful life over which a non goodwill intangible asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the cash flows of the Company. An intangible asset with a finite useful life is amortized; an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized, but is evaluated annually for impairment. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. At January 2, 2010, goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to $5.1 billion, consisting primarily of goodwill and trademarks associated with the 2001 acquisition of Keebler Foods Company. Within this total, approximately $1.4 billion of non goodwill intangible assets were classified as indefinite lived, comprised principally of Keebler trademarks. We currently believe that the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds their carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to the cash flows of the Company. At January 2, 2010, the fair value of our North America snacks reporting unit was almost twice its book value. However, if we had used materially different assumptions, which we do not believe are reasonably possible, regarding the future performance of our business or a different weighted average cost of capital in the valuation, this could have resulted in significant impairment losses and or amortization expense. Retirement benefits Our Company sponsors a number of U.S. and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the United States and Canada. Plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations and asset return performance. A substantial majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of debt securities and other investments. We recognize the cost of benefits provided during retirement over the employees active working life to determine the obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans. Inherent in this concept is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date. Major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the long term rates of return on plan assets, the health care cost trend rates, and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans, which cover employees in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. To conduct our annual review of the long term rate of return on plan assets, we model expected returns over a 20 year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans. The return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forward looking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on long term bonds, price earnings ratios of the major stock market indices, and long term inflation. Our U.S. plan model, corresponding to approximately 68% of our trust assets globally, currently incorporates a long term inflation assumption of 2.5% and an active management premium of 1% (net of fees) validated by historical analysis. Although we review our expected long term rates of return annually, our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. Our expected rates of return are generally not revised, provided these rates continue to fall within a more likely than not corridor of between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected long term returns, as determined by our modeling process. Our assumed rate of return for U.S. plans in 2009 of 8.9% equated to approximately the 58th percentile expectation of our 2009 model. Similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets, reflecting local economic conditions. Foreign trust investments represent approximately 32% of our global benefit plan assets. Based on consolidated benefit plan assets at January 2, 2010, a 100 basis point reduction in the assumed rate of return would increase 2010 benefits expense by approximately $40 million. 22 Correspondingly, a 100 basis point shortfall between the assumed and actual rate of return on plan assets for 2010 would result in a similar amount of arising experience loss. Any arising asset related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated value of plan assets over a five year period. Once recognized, experience gains and losses are amortized using a declining balance method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants, which for U.S. plans is presently about 12 years. Under this recognition method, a 100 basis point shortfall in actual versus assumed performance of all of our plan assets in 2010 would reduce pre tax earnings by approximately $1.4 million in 2011, increasing to approximately $7 million in 2015. For each of the three fiscal years, our actual return on plan assets exceeded (was less than) the recognized assumed return by the following amounts (in millions): 2009 $507; 2008$(1,528); 2007$(99). To conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates, we model our actual claims cost data over a five year historical period, including an analysis of pre 65 versus post 65 age groups and other important demographic components in our covered retiree population. This data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends. Our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding short term future trends. In comparison to our actual five year compound annual claims cost growth rate of approximately 2.4%, our initial trend rate for 2010 of 7.1% reflects the expected future impact of faster growing claims experience for certain demographic groups within our total employee population. Our initial rate is trended downward by 0.5% per year, until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5% is reached. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Based on consolidated obligations at January 2, 2010, a 100 basis point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase 2010 benefits expense by approximately $17 million. A 100 basis point excess of 2010 actual health care claims cost over that calculated from the assumed trend rate would result in an arising experience loss of approximately $9 million. Any arising health care claims cost related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated amount of claims experience over a four year period. Once recognized, experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight line method over 15 years. The net experience gain arising from recognition of 2009 claims experience was approximately $16 million. To conduct our annual review of discount rates, we selected the discount rate using the spot yield curve underlying the Citigroup Index (published monthly by Citigroup). Using this methodology, we determined the single discount rate for each of our retirement plans that was equivalent to discounting against the entire Citigroup spot yield curve. The measurement dates for our defined benefit plans are consistent with our fiscal year end. Accordingly, we select discount rates to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during December of each year. Based on consolidated obligations at January 2, 2010, a 25 basis point decline in the weighted average discount rate used for benefit plan measurement purposes would increase 2010 benefits expense by approximately $14 million. All obligation related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants. Despite the previously described rigorous policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions, we periodically experience material differences between assumed and actual experience. As of January 2, 2010, we had consolidated unamortized prior service cost and net experience losses of approximately $1.7 billion, as compared to approximately $1.9 billion at January 3, 2009. The year over year decrease in net unamortized amounts was attributable primarily to favorable asset performance during 2009. Of the total unamortized amounts at January 2, 2010, approximately $1.5 billion was related to asset losses that occurred during 2008, offset by $0.5 billion in asset gains during 2009, with the remainder largely related to discount rate reductions and net unfavorable health care claims experience (including upward revisions in the assumed trend rate) prior to 2009. For 2010, we currently expect total amortization of prior service cost and net experience losses to be approximately $37 million higher than the actual 2009 amount of approximately $73 million. Total employee benefit expense for 2010 is expected to be higher than 2009 due to lower discount rates, a further phase in of the 2008 investment losses, offset by better than expected 2009 investment performance. Based on our current actuarial assumptions, we expect 2011 pension expense to increase significantly primarily due to the amortization of net experience losses. During 2009 we made contributions in the amount of $87 million to Kelloggs global tax qualified pension programs. This amount was mostly discretionary. We anticipate making additional contributions in future years due to the poor performance of global equity markets during 2008. Additionally we contributed $13 million to our retiree medical programs; most of this contribution was also discretionary and largely used to fund benefit obligations related to our union retiree healthcare benefits. Assuming actual future experience is consistent with our current assumptions, annual amortization of accumulated prior service cost and net experience 23 losses during each of the next several years would increase versus the 2009 amount. Income taxes Our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions to determine how much benefit should be recognized in our income tax expense. We establish tax reserves associated with uncertain tax positions based on a benefit recognition model, which we believe could result in a greater amount of benefit (and a lower amount of reserve) being initially recognized in certain circumstances. The Company evaluates uncertain tax positions in two steps. The first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based upon the technical merit of the position. In weighing the technical merits of the position, we consider the facts and circumstances of the position; we assume the reviewing tax authority has full knowledge of the position; and we consider the weight of authoritative guidance. The second step is measurement; a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. While reviewing the ranges of probable outcomes, the Company records the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The tax position will be derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained. For the periods presented, our income tax and related interest reserves have averaged approximately $130 million. Reserve adjustments for individual issues have rarely exceeded 1% of earnings before income taxes annually. Significant tax reserve adjustments impacting our effective tax rate would be separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of Note 10 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The current portion of our tax reserves and related interest reserves are presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet within other current liabilities and the amount expected to be settled after one year is recorded in other liabilities. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO BE ADOPTED IN FUTURE PERIODS Variable Interest Entities In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance that changed the consolidation model for variable interest entities (VIEs). This guidance requires companies to qualitatively assess the determination of the primary beneficiary of a VIE based on whether a company (1) has the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the activities of the VIE, and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. This standard is effective at the beginning of our 2010 fiscal year and must be applied retrospectively. The adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on our financial statements. FUTURE OUTLOOK Despite a tough economy in 2009, we met or exceeded all of our long term annual targets. We are poised to continue this momentum in 2010. We expect our business model and strategy will deliver internal net sales growth of 2 to 3%, in line with our long term annual targets of low single digits (1 to 3%). Internal operating profit is expected to grow 8 to 10%, above our long term annual target of mid single digits (4 to 6%). We expect this growth to result from savings from our up front cost programs as well as lower spending on up front costs. We expect our earnings per share to grow 11 to 13%, above our long term annual target of high single digit (7 to 9%) growth on a currency neutral basis. Gross profit margin percentage is expected to expand by approximately 100 basis points as our savings from cost reduction initiatives will more than offset pressure on cost of goods sold. Gross interest expense for 2010 is expected to decline to approximately $250 to $260 million. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately 30% to 31%. We continue to remain committed to investing in brand building, cost reduction initiatives, and other growth opportunities. Lastly, we expect our cash flow performance to remain strong and are currently expecting 2010 cash flow to be similar to 2009s result of $1,266 million after capital expenditures. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our Company is exposed to certain market risks, which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations. We use derivative financial and commodity instruments, where appropriate, to manage these risks. As a matter of policy, we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions. Refer to Note 12 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our derivative financial and commodity instruments. Foreign exchange risk Our Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related to third party purchases, intercompany loans and product shipments. Our Company is also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments. Additionally, our Company is exposed to 24 volatility in the translation of foreign currency earnings to U.S. dollars. Primary exposures include the U.S. dollar versus the British pound, euro, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, and Mexican peso, and in the case of inter subsidiary transactions, the British pound versus the euro. We assess foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational volatility and may enter into forward contracts, options, and currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in net long or short currency positions. Forward contracts and options are generally less than 18 months duration. Currency swap agreements are established in conjunction with the term of underlying debt issuances. The total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at year end 2009 was $1,588 million, representing a settlement obligation of $24 million. The total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at year end 2008 was $924 million, representing a settlement receivable of $22 million. All of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions, translational exposure, or existing assets or liabilities, and mature within 18 months. Assuming an unfavorable 10% change in year end exchange rates, the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately $159 million at year end 2009 and the settlement receivable would have decreased by $92 million at year end 2008. These unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures. With regard to our foreign currency exchange risk, we continue to monitor the highly volatile economic environment in Venezuela. On January 8, 2010, the Venezuelan government instituted a two tier official exchange rate system which was effective as of January 11, 2010. This resulted in a devaluation of the official rate that had previously been at 2.15 bolivars per $1. A preferential rate for essential items such as medical, food and heavy machinery was established at 2.6 bolivars per $1, referred to as the preferential rate. All other imports will be imported at 4.3 bolivars per $1, referred to as the oil rate. The government is compiling a list of the items it deems essential which can be imported at the preferential rate. We are in the process of determining which exchange rates will be applicable to our imports into Venezuela. However, currency exchange restrictions in Venezuela restrict our ability to obtain U.S. dollars at the official exchange rates. U.S. dollars may be obtained through a legal parallel exchange mechanism. We have and may continue to use this mechanism to exchange bolivars for U.S. dollars in order to satisfy U.S. dollar denominated obligations of our Venezuelan operations. As such, as of the end of our 2009 fiscal year, we are using the parallel rate to translate our Venezuelan subsidiarys financial statements to U.S. dollars. The impact of this change was not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements despite rates implied by transactions in the parallel market being significantly higher than the official rates. Inflation in Venezuela has been at relatively high levels over the past few years. We use a blend of the National Consumer Price Index and the Consumer Price Index to determine whether Venezuela is a highly inflationary economy. The blended index exceeded 100% during the fourth quarter of 2009 and as such, Venezuela will be designated as a highly inflationary economy as of the beginning of our 2010 fiscal year. Gains and losses resulting from the translation of the financial statements of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in earnings. We expect reported net sales and operating profit in Latin America will be negatively impacted, and it could be significant to our Latin America operating segment. On a consolidated basis, Venezuela represents only 1% to 2% of our business; therefore, the overall impact is expected to be minimal. Interest rate risk Our Company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future issuances of variable rate debt. Primary exposures include movements in U.S. Treasury rates, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), and commercial paper rates. We periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs associated with certain debt issues, and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt, based on current and projected market conditions. During 2009 and 2008, we entered into interest rate swaps in connection with certain U.S. Dollar Notes. Refer to disclosures contained in Note 6 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The total notional amount of our interest rate swaps was $1,900 million and $750 million, as of January 2, 2010 and January 3, 2009, respectively. Assuming average variable rate debt levels during the year, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by approximately $22 million in 2009 and $21 million in 2008. Price risk Our Company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials, fuel, and energy. Primary exposures include corn, wheat, soybean oil, sugar, cocoa, paperboard, natural gas, and diesel fuel. We have historically used the combination of long term contracts with suppliers, and exchange traded futures and option contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted raw material purchases over a duration of generally less than 18 months. During 2006, we entered into two separate 10 year over the counter commodity swap 25 transactions to reduce fluctuations in the price of natural gas used principally in our manufacturing processes. The notional amount of the swaps totaled $146 million as of January 2, 2010 and equates to approximately 50% of our North America manufacturing needs over the remaining hedge period. At year end 2008 the notional amount was $167 million. The total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at year end 2009, including the North America natural gas swaps, was $213 million, representing a settlement obligation of approximately $16 million. Assuming a 10% decrease in year end commodity prices, the settlement obligation would increase by approximately $18 million, generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases. The total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at year end 2008, including the natural gas swaps, was $267 million, representing a settlement obligation of approximately $16 million. Assuming a 10% decrease in year end commodity prices, this settlement obligation would increase by approximately $24 million, generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases. In some instances the Company has reciprocal collateralization agreements with counterparties regarding fair value positions in excess of certain thresholds. These agreements call for the posting of collateral in the form of cash, treasury securities or letters of credit if a fair value loss position to the Company or our counterparties exceeds a certain amount. There were no collateral balance requirements at January 2, 2010 or January 3, 2009. In addition to the commodity derivative instruments discussed above, we use long term contracts with suppliers to manage a portion of the price exposure associated with future purchases of certain raw materials, including rice, sugar, cartonboard, and corrugated boxes. It should be noted the exclusion of these contracts from the analysis above could be a limitation in assessing the net market risk of our Company. 26
