ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Kellogg Company and Subsidiaries RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand Kellogg Company, our operations and our present business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item 8 of this report. Kellogg Company is the worlds leading producer of cereal and a leading producer of convenience foods, including cookies, crackers, toaster pastries, cereal bars, fruit flavored snacks, frozen waffles, and veggie foods. Kellogg products are manufactured and marketed globally. We currently manage our operations in four geographic operating segments, comprised of North America and the three International operating segments of Europe, Latin America, and Asia Pacific. We manage our Company for sustainable performance defined by our long term annual growth targets. These targets are 3 to 4% for internal net sales, mid single digit (4 to 6%) for internal operating profit, and high single digit (7 to 9%) for diluted net earnings per share (EPS) on a currency neutral basis. See the Foreign currency translation section for a discussion and reconciliation of currency neutral EPS, a non GAAP measure. For our full year 2010, internal and reported net sales were down 1%. Consolidated internal operating profit was flat compared to the prior year. Reported operating profit decreased 1%. Diluted EPS increased 6% on a currency neutral basis. Reported EPS was $3.30, an increase of 4% over last years $3.16. Consolidated results(dollars in millions, exceptper share data) 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 12,397 $ 12,575 $ 12,822 Net sales growth: As reported (1.4 )% (1.9 )% 8.9 % Internal (a) (1.3 )% 3.0 % 5.4 % Operating profit $ 1,990 $ 2,001 $ 1,953 Operating profit growth: As reported (0.6 )% 2.5 % 4.5 % Internal (a) (0.1 )% 10.3 % 4.2 % Diluted net earningsper share (EPS) $ 3.30 $ 3.16 $ 2.99 EPS growth (b) 4 % 6 % 8 % Currency neutral diluted EPS growth (b) 6 % 13 % 8 % (a) Internal net sales and operating profit growth for 2010 exclude the impact of currency. Internal net sales and operating profit growth for 2009 exclude the impact of currency and acquisitions. Internal net sales and operating profit growth for 2008 exclude the impact of currency, a 53rd shipping week and acquisitions. Internal net sales and operating profit growth are non GAAP financial measures which are further discussed and reconciled to the directly comparable measures in accordance with U.S. GAAP in the Net sales and operating profit section. (b) See the section entitled Foreign currency translation for discussion and reconciliation of this non GAAP financial measure. While 2010 was a difficult year, we have taken actions to regain momentum in 2011. We believe we can achieve our objectives through increased innovation and investments in brand building initiatives. Kellogg has over a 100 year heritage with strong brands. In combination with an attractive dividend yield, we believe our business model will provide a strong total return to our shareholders. 13 Net sales and operating profit 2010 compared to 2009 The following table provides an analysis of net sales and operating profit performance for 2010 versus 2009: (dollars in millions) NorthAmerica Europe LatinAmerica AsiaPacific(a) Corporate Consolidated 2010 net sales $8,402 $2,230 $923 $842 $ $12,397 2009 net sales $8,510 $2,361 $963 $741 $ $12,575 % change 2010 vs. 2009: Volume (tonnage) (b) (2.5 )% (2.4 )% (3.4 )% 4.3 % (2.1 )% Pricing/mix .6 % (.3 )% 8.2 % (2.3 )% .8 % Subtotal internal business (1.9 )% (2.7 )% 4.8 % 2.0 % (1.3 )% Foreign currency impact .6 % (2.8 )% (8.9 )% 11.7 % (.1 )% Total change (1.3 )% (5.5 )% (4.1 )% 13.7 % (1.4 )% (dollars in millions) NorthAmerica Europe LatinAmerica AsiaPacific(a) Corporate Consolidated 2010 operating profit $1,554 $364 $153 $74 $(155) $1,990 2009 operating profit $1,569 $348 $179 $86 $(181) $2,001 % change 2010 vs. 2009: Internal business (1.7 )% 8.2 % (2.4 )% (29.5 )% 14.2 % (.1 )% Foreign currency impact .7 % (3.4 )% (12.3 )% 15.2 % (.5 )% Total change (1.0 )% 4.8 % (14.7 )% (14.3 )% 14.2 % (.6 )% (a) Includes Australia, Asia, and South Africa. (b) We measure the volume impact (tonnage) on revenues based on the stated weight of our product shipments. Our consolidated net sales were down 1% on both a reported and internal basis. There were four major issues that affected our results. First, our categories respond to innovation and brand building. We did not have sufficient cereal innovations in 2010. Rather, we focused on renovating our existing cereal products. We invested in renovation to improve the nutritional profile of our products. For 2011, we have a stronger innovation pipeline to drive top line growth. Secondly, we experienced supply chain disruptions in our waffle business and had a second quarter recall of select packages of breakfast cereals. As a result, we have increased investment in our supply chain to mitigate potential risks. Next, we experienced weakness in our core cereal businesses in both measured and non measured channels. Lastly, the competitive environment drove price deflation into the cereal category. In late 2010 we announced price increases driven by higher input costs on many products across our categories around the world. Internal net sales for our North America operating segment declined 2%. North America has three product groups: retail cereal, retail snacks and frozen and specialty channels. Retail cereals internal net sales declined by 5% on a full year basis. Our consumption was negatively impacted by the impact of the cereal recall that occurred in the second quarter of 2010. The brands involved in the recall were the cornerstone of our back to school promotions in the third quarter. Promotional pricing drove deflation into the category, but did not drive higher category volumes as would be expected. The U.S. cereal category responds well to innovation. While there were lower levels of innovation across the category in 2010, our innovations performed well. We have also been impacted by less support from non measured channels this year. Trade inventory levels at the end of 2009 were higher than normal. As a result, our 2010 sales were negatively impacted as retailers sold through their inventory, reducing their purchases from us. The retail snack product group (cookies, crackers, toaster pastries, cereal bars, and fruit flavored snacks) grew by 1%. The modest growth was driven by Pop Tarts&reg; and strong wholesome snack sales including our bar innovations such as FiberPlus&reg; and Special K Fruit Crisps&reg;. The strong performance in wholesome snacks was masked by weaker performance in cookies and to a lesser extent crackers. We were able to maintain our cracker category share in measured channels despite increased competitive promotional activity. Consumption in the cookie category was down for the year. Our cookie performance was also impacted by the loss of shelf space in non measured channels, which we were able to regain during the fourth quarter of 2010. Internal net sales in the frozen and specialty channels (frozen foods, food service and vending) decreased by 3%. Our sales were negatively impacted during the year due to the waffle supply disruption that began late in 2009. We have returned to full capacity and have introduced new innovations. While the business rebounded slower than expected during 2010 as it took longer to rebuild and reset retailer shelves, we have reinstated brand building and the business is responding positively. Our veggie business continues to perform well, particularly Morningstar Farms&reg; burgers and entrees. Our food service business grew during the year, continuing to outperform the industry. Our International operating segments internal net sales were flat compared to the prior year. Europes internal net sales declined 3% for the year. The cereal category (as measured by consumption) declined in our core European countries such as the U.K. Additionally, we saw price deflation in many food categories across Europe, especially in the U.K. Continued weakness in the Russia snack business drove lower volumes and contributed to Europes lower top line results. We worked to stabilize the bulk business while introducing packaged snacks in Russia. Latin Americas internal net sales growth was 5%. The growth in cereal masked the decline in snacks. Our decline in snacks was largely driven by Venezuela where we import some products from Mexico. The imports were impacted by exchange rate controls and it is no longer cost efficient to import goods. Internal 14 net sales in Asia Pacific grew 2% driven by strong performance across most of Asia, as well as South Africa. This was muted by a decline in Australia where the cereal category faced price deflation. Consolidated operating profit declined by 1% on an as reported basis and was flat on an internal basis, when excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Operating profit for the year was negatively impacted by the cereal recall, higher than expected commodity inflation and investments in our supply chain. Operating profit benefited from lower incentive compensation expense. Incentive compensation is based upon the Companys actual results compared to our target. Given results were lower than our targets, which were set at the beginning of 2010, incentive compensation decreased significantly compared to the prior year. Despite 2010s operating performance, we recognized the need to invest in advertising. Accordingly, we increased our spending in advertising by 4%, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Internal operating profit in North America decreased by 2%, Europes grew by 8%, Latin Americas declined by 2% and Asia Pacifics declined by 30%. North Americas decline was attributable to lower sales in our U.S. cereal business. Competitive activity drove lower cereal sales as did the second quarter cereal recall. These negative drivers were partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense and decreased spending on cost reduction initiatives. Europes operating profit increased due to lower commodity costs and less spending on cost reduction initiatives. The decline in Latin Americas operating profit is primarily a result of higher commodity costs. Asia Pacifics operating profit was negatively impacted by the impairment charges related to our business in China. Refer to Note 2 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Corporate benefited from lower incentive compensation expense. 2009 compared to 2008 The following table provides an analysis of net sales and operating profit performance for 2009 versus 2008: (dollars in millions) NorthAmerica Europe LatinAmerica AsiaPacific (a) Corporate Consolidated 2009 net sales $ 8,510 $ 2,361 $ 963 $ 741 $ $ 12,575 2008 net sales $ 8,457 $ 2,619 $ 1,030 $ 716 $ $ 12,822 % change 2009 vs. 2008: Volume (tonnage) (b) (.7 )% (1.6 )% 1.2 % (1.3 )% (.7 )% Pricing/mix 3.5 % 3.2 % 5.6 % 6.3 % 3.7 % Subtotal internal business 2.8 % 1.6 % 6.8 % 5.0 % 3.0 % Acquisitions (c) .1 % .3 % 3.7 % .3 % Shipping daydifferences (d) (1.8 )% (1.1 )% (.5 )% (.9 )% (1.5 )% Foreign currency impact (.5 )% (10.6 )% (12.9 )% (4.3 )% (3.7 )% Total change .6 % (9.8 )% (6.6 )% 3.5 % (1.9 )% (dollars in millions) NorthAmerica Europe LatinAmerica AsiaPacific(a) Corporate Consolidated 2009 operating profit $ 1,569 $ 348 $ 179 $ 86 $ (181 ) $ 2,001 2008 operating profit $ 1,447 $ 390 $ 209 $ 92 $ (185 ) $ 1,953 % change 2009 vs. 2008: Internal business 11.4 % 7.0 % (2.0 )% 13.5 % 10.3 % Acquisitions (c) (8.4 )% (.4 )% Shipping daydifferences (d) (2.4 )% (1.3 )% .9 % (.8 )% 1.8 % (1.8 )% Foreign currency impact (.5 )% (16.5 )% (13.1 )% (10.5 )% (5.6 )% Total change 8.5 % (10.8 )% (14.2 )% (6.2 )% 1.8 % 2.5 % (a) Includes Australia, Asia and South Africa. (b) We measure the volume impact (tonnage) on revenues based on the stated weight of our product shipments. (c) Impact of results for the year to date period ended January 2, 2010 from the acquisitions of United Bakers, Navigable Foods, Specialty Cereal and certain assets and liabilities of IndyBake. (d) Impact of 53rd shipping week in 2008. Our 2009 consolidated reported net sales were down compared to the prior year, driven by a negative impact from foreign currency translation and an extra shipping week in 2008. Excluding this negative impact, internal net sales grew by 3%, lapping 2008s strong 5% growth. While overall volume declined, we achieved internal net sales growth driven by a particularly strong year in retail cereal and a solid year in retail snacks resulting from our pricing and mix. There were several factors contributing to the volume decline. In North America, we experienced a supply disruption in our waffle plants. In both Russia and China, we started moving our businesses away from lower margin products to higher margin branded products, which resulted in a decline in volume during the year. Our North America operating segment had internal net sales growth of almost 3% against a difficult 6% comparative in 2008. We experienced growth in retail cereal of 4% and 3% growth in retail snacks, which includes cookies, crackers, toaster pastries, cereal bars and fruit snacks. Weakness in frozen and specialty 15 channels, which includes frozen foods, food service and vending, dampened net sales for the year, with a decline in net sales of 1%. We experienced broad based growth in retail snacks, with sales growth of 3%. Pop Tarts&reg; performed well as the category leader in North America toaster pastries. A strong performance by Cheez It&reg; as well as innovation, drove growth in crackers. Cookies posted a slight gain for the year led by Mothers&reg; brand cookies. Our growth was negatively impacted by heavy competitor activity. Our best performing category within retail snacks was wholesome snacks. The introduction of Fiber Plus&reg;, Special K Chocolaty Pretzel&reg; and Cinnabon&reg; bars drove growth in this category. Our frozen and specialty channels business was down 1% due to a few discrete issues. Our food service business is mostly non commercial, serving institutions such as schools, hospitals and prisons. This sector of the industry was not immediately impacted by the economic downturn that started in 2008. While we started to see recovery in 2009, it was slower than the commercial sectors such as hotels and restaurants. We were also experiencing a supply disruption in our waffle facilities. We made improvements in our facilities and worked with regulatory agencies. A combination of extensive enhancements and repairs at our facilities and a flood at one facility, significantly impacted production in the second half of 2009. While our plants were operational at the end of 2009, they were not running at their previous level of capacity. Demand continued to exceed supply. Our International operating segments collectively achieved net sales growth of 3% on an internal basis. Europes internal net sales increased 2% year over year. Europe was a tough environment for us during the year. We encountered some retailer disputes earlier in 2009 that were resolved in the second half of the year, helping us to achieve cereal volume growth. Latin Americas internal net sales growth was 7% attributable to both volume and price increases driven by retail cereal in Mexico and Venezuela. Internal net sales in Asia Pacific grew 5%, driven by strong cereal performances in Australia and India. Our consolidated operating profit increased by 10% on an internal basis and by 2% on a reported basis. Reported operating profit in each of our operating segments was negatively impacted by foreign exchange as well as the absence of a 53rd week in 2009. In 2009, we continued to experience cost pressures, increased our spending on cost reduction initiatives, and invested in advertising. We were able to more than offset these increased costs by savings from our cost reduction and productivity initiatives as well as pricing and mix. During the full year of 2009 up front costs were $138 million, which were $63 million higher than the previous year. Up front costs represent both exit or disposal activities as well as other cost reduction initiatives. North Americas internal operating profit growth of 11% was driven by price and savings from our cost reduction initiatives, which was partially offset by significantly higher up front costs and increased advertising. Up front costs reduced North Americas operating profit by 4%. Europes internal operating profit increased 7% benefiting from media deflation and operating efficiencies while absorbing higher up front costs which reduced reported operating profit by 3%. Internal operating profit decreased 2% in Latin America due to significantly higher material costs and increased advertising. Internal operating profit growth in Asia Pacific was 14% due to sales growth, while reported operating profit was negatively impacted by the acquisition of Navigable Foods. For further information on our acquisitions, see Note 2 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Margin performance Margin performance was as follows: Change vs.prior year (pts.) 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 Gross margin (a) 42.7 % 42.9 % 41.9 % (.2 ) 1.0 SGA% (b) (26.6 )% (27.0 )% (26.7 )% .4 (.3 ) Operating margin 16.1 % 15.9 % 15.2 % .2 .7 (a) Gross profit as a percentage of net sales. Gross profit is equal to net sales less cost of goods sold. (b) Selling, general, and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales. As illustrated in the preceding table, our consolidated gross margin declined by 20 basis points in 2010 due to the cereal recall, increased cost pressures for fuel, energy, commodities and employee benefits and supply chain investments, which were more than offset by savings from cost reduction initiatives and lower up front costs recorded in cost of sales (COGS). Our selling, general and administrative (SGA) expense as a percentage of net sales decreased by 40 basis points primarily due to a reduction in incentive compensation expense and lower costs for cost reduction initiatives, which more than offset increased advertising investment and a goodwill impairment. Our consolidated gross margin increased by 100 basis points in 2009. Acquisitions lowered gross margin by approximately 10 basis points. We experienced inflationary cost pressures for fuel, energy, commodities and employee benefits. During 2009, higher costs, including increased investment in up front costs recorded in COGS, were more than offset by savings from cost reduction initiatives and price increases. Our SGA expense as a percentage of net sales increased slightly due to higher costs for cost reduction initiatives of $17 million recorded in overhead as well as an increase in advertising spend. 16 Foreign currency translation The reporting currency for our financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of our assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily in the Euro, British pound, Mexican peso, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates. As a result, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. This could have significant impact on our results if such increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar is substantial. Volatility in the foreign exchange markets has limited our ability to forecast future U.S. dollar reported earnings. As such, we are measuring diluted earnings per share growth and providing guidance on future earnings on a currency neutral basis, assuming earnings are translated at the prior years exchange rates. This non GAAP financial measure is being used to focus management and investors on local currency business results, thereby providing visibility to the underlying trends of the Company. Management believes that excluding the impact of foreign currency from EPS provides a useful measurement of comparability given the volatility in foreign exchange markets. Below is a reconciliation of reported EPS to currency neutral EPS for the fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008: Consolidated results 2010 2009 2008 Diluted net earnings per share (EPS) $ 3.30 $ 3.16 $ 2.99 Translational impact (a) 0.04 0.22 Currency neutral EPS $ 3.34 $ 3.38 $ 2.99 Currency neutral EPS growth (b) 6 % 13 % 8 % (a) Translation impact is the difference between reported EPS and the translation of current year net profits at prior year exchange rates, adjusted for gains (losses) on translational hedges, if applicable. (b) Calculated as a percentage of growth from the prior years reported EPS. Exit or disposal activities We view our continued spending on cost reduction initiatives as part of our ongoing operating principles to provide greater visibility in achieving our long term profit growth targets. Initiatives undertaken are currently expected to recover cash implementation costs within a five year period of completion. Upon completion (or as each major stage is completed in the case of multi year programs), the project begins to deliver cash savings and or reduced depreciation. We incurred costs that qualify as exit costs under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Refer to Note 3 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail on our exit or disposal plans. We include these charges in our measure of operating segment profitability. Management announced its intention to achieve $1 billion of annual cost savings in three years. The savings challenge began in 2009 with a goal of achieving $1 billion of savings by the end of 2011. These initiatives are integral to meeting our savings challenge. Other cost reduction initiatives 2010 activities In addition to exit costs, we incurred costs related to our cost reduction initiatives which do not qualify as exit costs under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. These represent cash costs for consulting and other charges for our COGS and SGA programs that are discussed in further detail in Note 3 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Costs incurred in fiscal year 2010 as well as total program costs are as follows: (millions) For the year endedJanuary, 1 2011 Total program costs throughJanuary, 1 2011 COGSprograms SGAprograms Total COGSprograms SGAprograms Total North America $ 17 $ 1 $ 18 $ 67 $ 14 $ 81 Europe 10 1 11 20 3 23 Latin America 3 3 8 8 Asia Pacific 3 3 8 8 Corporate 3 3 3 3 Total $ 33 $ 5 $ 38 $ 103 $ 20 $ 123 The additional cost and cash outlay in 2011 for these programs, excluding exit costs, is estimated to be $5 to $10 million. SAP reimplementation We are reimplementing SAP which will result in process and productivity improvements. The program is expected to require approximately $70 million of expense, in addition to capital investments. We are incurring incremental consulting costs associated with the reimplementation, which will begin in 2011. During 2010, we incurred approximately $9 million of cash consulting costs associated with the SAP reimplementation. The costs were recorded in SGA expense within the North America operating segment for $8 million and the Latin America operating segment for $1 million. The additional cost and cash outlay in 2011 and 2012 for this program, is estimated to be $60 million. This program is not included in the table above. 17 Prior year activities During 2009, we incurred $73 million of costs related to our on going COGS and SGA programs. These represent cash costs for consulting and other charges. The costs by program and segment were as follows (in millions): (millions) For the year ended,January 2, 2010 COGSprograms SGAprograms Total North America $ 38 $ 13 $ 51 Europe 10 2 12 Latin America 5 5 Asia Pacific 5 5 Total $ 58 $ 15 $ 73 Interest expense As illustrated in the following table, annual interest expense for the 2008 to 2010 periods has trended downward. The decline in 2010 was due primarily to costs incurred in 2009 for early redemption of long term debt and lower interest rates on our long term debt. Interest income (recorded in other income (expense), net) was (in millions), 2010 $6; 2009 $4; 2008 $20. The decline for 2009 was primarily due to a drop in average interest rates. We currently expect that our 2011 gross interest expense will be approximately $235 to $245 million.

Income taxes Our reported effective tax rates for 2010, 2009 and 2008 were 28.8%, 28.2% and 29.7% respectively. The impact of discrete adjustments and the cost of remitted and unremitted foreign earnings reduced our effective income tax rate by 3 percentage points for 2010. For 2009 and 2008, the impact was a reduction of 2% and 1% respectively. Refer to Note 10 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. For 2011, we expect our consolidated effective income tax rate to be approximately 30%. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact the expected effective income tax rate as it is dependent upon U.S. dollar earnings of foreign subsidiaries doing business in various countries with differing statutory tax rates. Additionally, the rate could be impacted if pending uncertain tax matters, including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives, are resolved more or less favorably than we currently expect. Product withdrawal Refer to Note 12 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions. Our cash generating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs. We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our credit facilities and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that volatility and or disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us, or at all. The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows: (millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,008 $ 1,643 $ 1,267 Investing activities (465 ) (370 ) (681 ) Financing activities (439 ) (1,182 ) (780 ) Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents 6 (12 ) (75 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 110 $ 79 $ (269 ) Operating activities The principal source of our operating cash flows is net earnings, meaning cash receipts from the sale of our products, net of costs to manufacture and market our products. Our net cash provided by operating activities for 2010 amounted to $1,008 million, a decrease of $635 million compared with 2009. The reduction in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to higher pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions and increased payments for advertising and promotion in 2010. Our net cash provided by operating activities for 2009 amounted to $1,643 million, an increase of $376 million compared with 2008, reflecting lower pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions and the impact of lower payments for advertising and promotion in 2009. Our cash conversion cycle (defined as days of inventory and trade receivables outstanding less days of trade payables outstanding, based on a trailing 12 month average) is relatively short, equating to approximately 23 days for 2010, 23 days for 2009, and 22 days for 2008. During 2010, the impact of 18 higher days of inventory outstanding was offset by an increase in days of trade payables outstanding. Days of inventory outstanding reflected the higher levels needed to improve order fill levels, along with the impact of lower reported sales in 2010. Core working capital in 2010 averaged 6.6% of net sales, compared to 6.5% in the prior year. The increase in 2009s cash conversion cycle was the result of a decrease in days of trade payables outstanding, which led to a 30 basis point increase in core working capital as an average of net sales in 2009 compared with 2008. Our total pension and postretirement benefit plan funding amounted to $643 million, $100 million and $451 million, in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we made incremental contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans amounting to $563 million ($467 million, net of tax). We also made additional plan contributions amounting to $400 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, after adverse conditions in the equity markets caused the actual rate of return on our pension and postretirement plan assets to be significantly below our assumed long term rate of return of 8.9%. The Pension Protection Act (PPA), and subsequent regulations, determines defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements in the United States. We believe that we will not be required to make any contributions under PPA requirements until 2017 or beyond. Our projections concerning timing of PPA funding requirements are subject to change primarily based on general market conditions affecting trust asset performance, future discount rates based on average yields of high quality corporate bonds and our decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the PPA. We currently project that we will make total U.S. and foreign benefit plan contributions in 2011 of approximately $200 million. Actual 2011 contributions could be different from our current projections, as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities, future changes in government requirements, trust asset performance, renewals of union contracts, or higher than expected health care claims cost experience. We measure cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions. We use this non GAAP financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment, dividend distributions, acquisition opportunities, and share repurchases. Our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measure, as follows: (dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,008 $ 1,643 $ 1,267 Additions to properties (474 ) (377 ) (461 ) Cash flow $ 534 $ 1,266 $ 806 year over year change (57.8 )% 57.1 % Year over year changes in cash flow (as defined) were driven by variations in the amount of contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans and changes in the level of capital expenditures during the three year period. For 2011, we are expecting cash flow (as defined) to be $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, which reflects the impact of 2011 expected pension contributions, net of tax. Investing activities Our net cash used in investing activities for 2010 amounted to $465 million, an increase of $95 million compared with 2009 due to a higher level of capital expenditures in 2010. Capital spending in 2010 included investments in our information technology infrastructure related to the reimplementation and upgrade of our SAP platform and investments in our supply chain. In 2009, we spent capital for a new facility to manufacture ready to eat cereal in Mexico and completed the expansion of the global research center located in Battle Creek, Michigan, the W. K. Kellogg Institute for Food and Nutrition Research. The investment in our global research center, which began in 2008, reflects our commitment to innovation which is a key driver to the growth of our business. In 2008, we also incurred construction costs to increase manufacturing capacity in Europe. Net cash used in investing activities of $370 million in 2009 decreased by $311 million compared with 2008, reflecting a reduction in business acquisition activity, and to a lesser extent, lower capital spending. During 2008, we used cash to expand our platform for future growth with acquisitions in Russia, China, the U.S. and Australia. Acquisitions are discussed in Note 2 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash paid for additions to properties as a percentage of net sales amounted to 3.8% in 2010, 3.0% in 2009, and 3.6% in 2008. We anticipate spending approximately 4% of net sales for additions to properties in 2011. In addition to continuing to invest in our supply chain and information technology infrastructure, our spending will also focus on increasing capacity to facilitate growth and innovation. 19 Financing activities Our net cash used in financing activities for 2010, 2009 and 2008 amounted to $439 million, $1,182 million, and $780 million, respectively. Total debt was $5.9 billion at year end 2010 and $4.9 billion at year end 2009. In December 2010, we issued $1.0 billion of ten year 4.0% fixed rate U.S. Dollar Notes, using a portion of the $987 million net proceeds to make incremental pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions. The proceeds were also used to retire commercial paper. Taking into consideration the impact of hedge settlements and the issuance discount, the effective interest rate on the notes issued in December 2010 is 3.42%. In November 2009, we issued $500 million of ten year 4.15% fixed rate U.S. Dollar Notes, and used proceeds of $496 million to retire a portion of our 6.6% U.S. Dollar Notes due 2011. We retired $482 million of the 2011 debt, which had an effective interest rate of 7.08%, through a tender offer. In connection with the debt retirement, we recognized $35 million of interest expense and an acceleration of $3 million loss on an interest rate swap, which was previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. These charges were included in 2009 cash flows from operating activities. In May 2009, we issued $750 million of seven year 4.45% fixed rate U.S. Dollar Notes, and used proceeds of $745 million to pay down commercial paper. In May 2009, we also entered into interest rate swaps on $1,150 million of our debt. Interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $750 million effectively converted our 5.125% U.S. Dollar Notes due 2012 from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation for the remainder of the five year term. In addition, interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $400 million effectively converted a portion of our 6.6% U.S. Dollar Notes due 2011 from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation for the remaining term. In March 2008, we issued $750 million of five year 4.25% fixed rate U.S. Dollar Notes under an existing shelf registration statement. We used proceeds of $746 million from issuance of this long term debt to retire a portion of our commercial paper. In conjunction with this debt issuance, we entered into interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $750 million, which effectively converted this debt from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation for the duration of the five year term. In 2008, we had cash outflows of $465 million in connection with the repayment of five year U.S. Dollar Notes at maturity in June 2008. That debt had an effective interest rate of 3.35%. We repurchased approximately 21 million shares of our common stock in 2010 for $1.1 billion under a share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in April 2010. This program authorized repurchases of our common stock amounting to $2.5 billion during 2010 through 2012. This three year authorization replaced a previous share buyback program which had authorized stock repurchases of up to $1.1 billion for 2010. During 2011 and 2012, we plan to execute the remaining repurchases under the 2010 authorization, with projected purchases of $800 million in 2011 and the balance in 2012. We expect 2011 average shares outstanding to decline by 4 percent compared with 2010. Actual repurchases could be different from our current projections, as influenced by factors such as changes in our stock price and other competing priorities. During 2009, we spent $187 million to repurchase 4 million of our shares while in 2008 we spent $650 million to repurchase 13 million shares. Our Board of Directors had authorized annual stock repurchases of up to $650 million for 2009 and 2008. In addition, a separate $500 million share repurchase authorization received Board approval in 2008. We made no repurchases under this authorization, which was later terminated, because we decided to use cash to fund pension and postretirement benefit plans and reduce commercial paper. We paid quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling $1.56 per share in 2010, $1.43 per share in 2009 and $1.30 per share in 2008. Total cash paid for dividends increased by 7.0% in 2010 and 10.3% in 2009. Our objective is to maintain our dividend pay out ratio between 40% and 50% of reported net earnings. Our long term debt agreements contain customary covenants that limit the Company and some of its subsidiaries from incurring certain liens or from entering into certain sale and lease back transactions. Some agreements also contain change in control provisions. However, they do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings. A change in the Companys credit ratings could limit our access to the U.S. short term debt market and or increase the cost of refinancing long term debt in the future. However, even under these circumstances, we would continue to have access to our Five Year Credit Agreement, which expires in November 2011. Under this facility, we can borrow up to $2.0 billion on a revolving credit basis. This source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis, although we do not currently plan to use it. We are in the process of entering into a new credit agreement that will replace the existing agreement. We plan to use commercial paper to refinance our $946 million of debt maturing in the first quarter of 2011. 20 During the third quarter of 2008 and thereafter, capital and credit markets, including commercial paper markets, experienced increased instability and disruption as the U.S. and global economies underwent a period of extreme uncertainty. Throughout this period of uncertainty, we continued to have access to the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper markets. Our commercial paper and term debt credit ratings were not affected by the changes in the credit environment. We monitor the financial strength of our third party financial institutions, including those that hold our cash and cash equivalents as well as those who serve as counterparties to our credit facilities, our derivative financial instruments, and other arrangements. We continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future, while still meeting our operational needs, including the pursuit of selected bolt on acquisitions. This will be accomplished through our strong cash flow, our short term borrowings, and our maintenance of credit facilities on a global basis. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Off balance sheet arrangements As of January 1, 2011 and January 2, 2010 we did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements. Contractual obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at January 1, 2011: Contractual obligations Payments due by period (millions) Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 andbeyond Long term debt: Principal $ 5,808 $ 946 $ 750 $ 752 $ 8 $ 1 $ 3,351 Interest (a) 2,960 278 259 221 216 216 1,770 Capital leases (b) 5 1 1 1 1 1 Operating leases (c) 585 149 126 94 66 47 103 Purchase obligations (d) 759 632 47 37 17 15 11 Uncertain tax positions (e) 43 43 Other long term obligations (f) 625 135 60 59 73 76 222 Total $ 10,785 $ 2,184 $ 1,243 $ 1,164 $ 381 $ 355 $ 5,458 (a) Includes interest payments on our long term debt and payments on our interest rate swaps. Interest calculated on our variable rate debt was forecasted using the LIBOR forward rate curve as of January 1, 2011. (b) The total expected cash payments on our capital leases include interest expense totaling approximately $1 million over the periods presented above. (c) Operating leases represent the minimum rental commitments under non cancelable operating leases. (d) Purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments for raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business and for marketing, advertising and other services. The amounts presented in the table do not include items already recorded in accounts payable or other current liabilities at year end 2010, nor does the table reflect cash flows we are likely to incur based on our plans, but are not obligated to incur. Therefore, it should be noted that the exclusion of these items from the table could be a limitation in assessing our total future cash flows under contracts. (e) As of January 1, 2011, our total liability for uncertain tax positions was $104 million, of which $43 million, is expected to be paid in the next twelve months. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the remaining $61 million. (f) Other long term obligations are those associated with noncurrent liabilities recorded within the Consolidated Balance Sheet at year end 2010 and consist principally of projected commitments under deferred compensation arrangements, multiemployer plans, and supplemental employee retirement benefits. The table also includes our current estimate of minimum contributions to defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans through 2016 as follows: 2011 $55; 2012 $38; 2013 $38; 2014 $59; 2015 $50; 2016 $51. While the table reflects the estimated minimum plan contributions, it does not include the total planned contributions to U.S. and foreign benefit plans. For 2011, we are currently projecting that we will make total benefit plan contributions of approximately $200 million. 21 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Promotional expenditures Our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities such as in store displays and events, feature price discounts, consumer coupons, contests and loyalty programs. The costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded, which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure. The recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer. These estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs. Differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally insignificant and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. On a full year basis, these subsequent period adjustments have rarely represented more than 0.3% of our Companys net sales. However, our Companys total promotional expenditures (including amounts classified as a revenue reduction) represented approximately 40% of 2010 net sales; therefore, it is likely that our results would be materially different if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail. Property Long lived assets such as property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment when conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Management evaluates several conditions, including, but not limited to, the following: a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or an asset group; a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used, including an extended period of idleness; and a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. For assets to be held and used, we project the expected future undiscounted cash flows generated by the long lived asset or asset group over the remaining useful life of the primary asset. If the cash flow analysis yields an amount less than the carrying amount we determine the fair value of the asset or asset group by using comparable market data. There are inherent uncertainties associated with the judgments and estimates we use in these analyses. At January 1, 2011, we have property plant and equipment of $3.1 billion, net of accumulated depreciation, on our balance sheet. Included in this amount are approximately $70 million of idle assets. The largest individual idle asset is a facility outside the United States which we tested for impairment on a held and used basis. The estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceeded the net book value of the facility as of January 1, 2011. Management estimates the plant will be deployed within the next several years. Should managements plan for deployment change, this could result in an impairment charge of up to $50 million based on the current carrying value. Goodwill and other intangible assets We perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually during the fourth quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual budgeting process. Goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit with associated goodwill. Carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units. For the 2010 goodwill impairment test, the fair value of the reporting units was estimated based on market multiples. Our approach employs market multiples based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, earnings for companies comparable to our reporting units and discounted cash flows. Management believes the assumptions used for the impairment test are consistent with those utilized by a market participant performing similar valuations for our reporting units. Similarly, impairment testing of indefinite lived intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset. Fair values of non goodwill intangible assets are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset. For instance, cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales discounted at rates consistent with rates used by market participants. These estimates are made using various inputs including historical data, current and anticipated market conditions, management plans, and market comparables. We also evaluate the useful life over which a non goodwill intangible asset with a finite life is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the cash flows of the Company. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. At January 1, 2011, goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to $5.1 billion, consisting primarily of goodwill and trademarks associated with the 2001 acquisition of Keebler Foods Company. Within this 22 total, approximately $1.4 billion of non goodwill intangible assets were classified as indefinite lived, comprised principally of Keebler trademarks. We currently believe that the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds their carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to the cash flows of the Company. At January 1, 2011, the fair value of our North America snacks reporting unit was almost twice its book value. However, if we had used materially different assumptions, which we do not believe are reasonably possible, regarding the future performance of our business or a different weighted average cost of capital in the valuation, this could have resulted in significant impairment losses. Additionally, we have $62 million of goodwill related to our 2008 acquisition of United Bakers in Russia. The percentage of excess fair value over carrying value of the Russian reporting unit declined in 2010 from an excess of 100% to an excess of 30%. The year over year decline was attributable to lower margins resulting from our strategy to stabilize the bulk snack business, while introducing packaged snacks, as well as reintroducing cereal into the market. If we used modestly different assumptions regarding sales multiples and earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in the valuation, this could have resulted in an impairment loss. For example, if our projection of EBITDA margins had been lower by 200 basis points, this change in assumption may have resulted in impairment of some or all of the goodwill in the Russian reporting unit. Management will continue to monitor the situation closely. Retirement benefits Our Company sponsors a number of U.S. and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the United States and Canada. Plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations and asset return performance. A substantial majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of debt securities and other investments. We recognize the cost of benefits provided during retirement over the employees active working life to determine the obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans. Inherent in this concept is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date. Major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the long term rates of return on plan assets, the health care cost trend rates, and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans, which cover employees in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. To conduct our annual review of the long term rate of return on plan assets, we model expected returns over a 20 year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans. The return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forward looking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on long term bonds, price earnings ratios of the major stock market indices, and long term inflation. Our U.S. plan model, corresponding to approximately 69% of our trust assets globally, currently incorporates a long term inflation assumption of 2.5% and an active management premium of 1% (net of fees) validated by historical analysis. Although we review our expected long term rates of return annually, our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. Our expected rates of return are generally not revised, provided these rates continue to fall within a more likely than not corridor of between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected long term returns, as determined by our modeling process. Our assumed rate of return for U.S. plans in 2010 of 8.9% equated to approximately the 62nd percentile expectation of our 2010 model. Similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets, reflecting local economic conditions. Foreign trust investments represent approximately 31% of our global benefit plan assets. Based on consolidated benefit plan assets at January 1, 2011, a 100 basis point reduction in the assumed rate of return would increase 2011 benefits expense by approximately $50 million. Correspondingly, a 100 basis point shortfall between the assumed and actual rate of return on plan assets for 2011 would result in a similar amount of arising experience loss. Any arising asset related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated value of plan assets over a five year period. Once recognized, experience gains and losses are amortized using a declining balance method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants, which for U.S. plans is presently about 13 years. Under this recognition method, a 100 basis point shortfall in actual versus assumed performance of all of our plan assets in 2011 would reduce pre tax earnings by approximately $1.7 million in 2012, increasing to approximately $8.5 million in 2016. For each of the three fiscal years, our actual return on plan assets exceeded (was less than) the recognized assumed return by the following amounts (in millions): 2010 $208; 2009$507; 2008$(1,528). To conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates, we model our actual claims cost data over a five year historical period, including an analysis of pre 65 versus post 65 age groups and other important demographic components in our covered retiree population. This data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends. 23 Our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding short term future trends. In comparison to our actual five year compound annual claims cost growth rate of approximately 0.8%, our initial trend rate for 2011 of 6.6% reflects the expected future impact of faster growing claims experience for certain demographic groups within our total employee population. Our initial rate is trended downward by 0.5% per year, until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5% is reached. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Based on consolidated obligations at January 1, 2011, a 100 basis point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase 2011 benefits expense by approximately $19 million. A 100 basis point excess of 2011 actual health care claims cost over that calculated from the assumed trend rate would result in an arising experience loss of approximately $9 million. Any arising health care claims cost related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated amount of claims experience over a four year period. Once recognized, experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight line method over 15 years. The net experience gain arising from recognition of 2010 claims experience was approximately $36 million. To conduct our annual review of discount rates, we selected the discount based on a cash flow matching analysis using Towers Watsons proprietary RATE:Link tool and projections of the future benefit payments constituting the projected benefit obligation for the plans. Prior to 2010, we employed a similar methodology, but used the spot yield curve underlying the Citigroup Index. There was no material difference in the discount rate resulting from the change. RATE:Link establishes the uniform discount rate that produces the same present value of the estimated future benefit payments, as is generated by discounting each years benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year. The spot rates used in this process are derived from a yield curve created from yields on the 40th to 90th percentile of U.S. high quality bonds. A similar methodology is applied in Canada and Europe, except the smaller bond markets imply that yields between the 10th and 90th percentiles are preferable. The measurement dates for our defined benefit plans are consistent with our fiscal year end. Accordingly, we select discount rates to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during December of each year. Based on consolidated obligations at January 1, 2011, a 25 basis point decline in the weighted average discount rate used for benefit plan measurement purposes would increase 2011 benefits expense by approximately $15 million. All obligation related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants. Despite the previously described rigorous policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions, we periodically experience material differences between assumed and actual experience. As of January 1, 2011, we had consolidated unamortized prior service cost and net experience losses of approximately $1.7 billion, similar to approximately $1.7 billion at January 2, 2010. Of the total unamortized amounts at January 1, 2011, approximately $1.4 billion was related to asset losses that occurred during 2008, offset by $0.7 billion in asset gains during 2009 and 2010, with the remainder largely related to discount rate reductions and net unfavorable health care claims experience (including upward revisions in the assumed trend rate) prior to 2010. For 2011, we currently expect total amortization of prior service cost and net experience losses to be approximately $27 million higher than the actual 2010 amount of approximately $113 million. Total employee benefit expense for 2011 is expected to be higher than 2010 due to lower discount rates, a further phase in of the 2008 investment losses, offset by better than expected 2009 and 2010 investment performance. Based on our current actuarial assumptions, we expect 2012 pension expense to increase primarily due to further phase in of 2008 investment losses. During 2010 we made contributions in the amount of $350 million to Kelloggs global tax qualified pension programs. This amount was mostly discretionary. Additionally we contributed $293 million to our retiree medical programs; most of this contribution was also discretionary and largely used to fund benefit obligations related to our union retiree healthcare benefits. Assuming actual future experience is consistent with our current assumptions, annual amortization of accumulated prior service cost and net experience losses during each of the next several years would increase versus the 2010 amount. Income taxes Our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The calculation of our income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgment. Income taxes are provided on the portion of foreign earnings that is expected to be remitted to and taxable in the United States. We recognize tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that the positions will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. For tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefits as the largest amount that we judge to 24 have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, new or emerging legislation and tax planning. The tax position will be derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained. Significant adjustments to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits impacting our effective tax rate are separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of Note 10 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO BE ADOPTED IN FUTURE PERIODS In December 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard related to application of the goodwill impairment model when a reporting unit has a carrying amount that is zero or a negative value. The new standard clarifies that when this is the case, a goodwill impairment test should be performed if qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill impairment exists. We will adopt this new accounting standard in the first quarter of 2011. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. FUTURE OUTLOOK We have taken actions to regain momentum in 2011 through increased innovation and by investing in our brands and our supply chain. We have strong innovations and expect improved trends in our core categories. We expect our internal net sales will grow by 3 to 4 percent. Internal operating profit is expected to be flat to down 2 percent, resulting from the increase in cost pressures as well as a comparison issue related to incentive compensation which was significantly lower in 2010 due to our results. Earnings per share on a currency neutral basis is expected to grow low single digits. Gross profit margin is expected to be down slightly for the year. Gross interest expense is expected to be $235 to $245 million. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30%. Lastly, we expect our cash flow performance to remain strong and are currently expecting 2011s cash flow to be between $1.1 and $1.2 billion. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our Company is exposed to certain market risks, which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations. We use derivative financial and commodity instruments, where appropriate, to manage these risks. As a matter of policy, we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions. Refer to Note 11 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our derivative financial and commodity instruments. Foreign exchange risk Our Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related primarily to third party purchases, intercompany transactions, and when applicable, nonfunctional currency denominated third party debt. Our Company is also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments. Additionally, our Company is exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency denominated earnings to U.S. dollars. Primary exposures include the U.S. dollar versus the British pound, euro, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, and Mexican peso, and in the case of inter subsidiary transactions, the British pound versus the euro. We assess foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational volatility and may enter into forward contracts, options, and currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in long or short currency positions. Forward contracts and options are generally less than 18 months duration. Currency swap agreements are established in conjunction with the term of underlying debt issuances. The total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at year end 2010 was $1,075 million, representing a settlement obligation of $20 million. The total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at year end 2009 was $1,588 million, representing a settlement obligation of $24 million. All of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions, translational exposure, or existing assets or liabilities, and mature within 18 months. Assuming an unfavorable 10% change in year end exchange rates, the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately $108 million at year end 2010 and $159 million at year end 2009. These unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures. Venezuela was designated as a highly inflationary economy as of the beginning of our 2010 fiscal year. 25 Gains and losses resulting from the translation of the financial statements of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in earnings. As of the end of our 2009 fiscal year, we used the parallel rate to translate our Venezuelan subsidiarys financial statements to U.S. dollars. In May 2010, the Venezuelan government effectively eliminated the parallel market. In June 2010, several large Venezuelan commercial banks began operating the Transaction System for Foreign Currency Denominated Securities (SITME). We intend to use SITME to settle U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities. Accordingly, we are using the SITME rate at January 1, 2011 to translate our Venezuelan subsidiarys financial statements to U.S. dollars. During the second quarter of 2010, we recorded an $8 million foreign exchange gain in other income (expense), net, associated with the translation of our subsidiarys financials into U.S. dollars, with the net impact for full year 2010 amounting to a $3 million gain. On a consolidated basis, Venezuela represents only 1% to 2% of our business; therefore, any ongoing impact is expected to be immaterial. Interest rate risk Our Company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future issuances of variable rate debt. Primary exposures include movements in U.S. Treasury rates, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), and commercial paper rates. We periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs associated with certain debt issues, and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt, based on current and projected market conditions. During 2009 and 2008, we entered into interest rate swaps in connection with certain U.S. Dollar Notes. Refer to disclosures contained in Note 6 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The total notional amount of interest rate swaps at year end 2010 was $1,900 million, representing a settlement receivable of $74 million. The total notional amount of interest rate swaps at year end 2009 was $1,900 million, representing a settlement receivable of $43 million. Assuming average variable rate debt levels during the year, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by approximately $21 million at year end 2010 and $22 million at year end 2009. Price risk Our Company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials, fuel, and energy. Primary exposures include corn, wheat, soybean oil, sugar, cocoa, paperboard, natural gas, and diesel fuel. We have historically used the combination of long term contracts with suppliers, and exchange traded futures and option contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted raw material purchases over a duration of generally less than 18 months. During 2006, we entered into two separate 10 year over the counter commodity swap transactions to reduce fluctuations in the price of natural gas used principally in our manufacturing processes. The notional amount of the swaps totaled $125 million as of January 1, 2011 and equates to approximately 50% of our North America manufacturing needs over the remaining hedge period. At year end January 2, 2010 the notional amount was $146 million. The total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at year end 2010, including the North America natural gas swaps, was $379 million, representing a settlement obligation of approximately $16 million. The total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at year end 2009, including the natural gas swaps, was $213 million, representing a settlement obligation of approximately $16 million. Assuming a 10% decrease in year end commodity prices, the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately $36 million at year end 2010, and $18 million at year end 2009, generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases. In some instances the Company has reciprocal collateralization agreements with counterparties regarding fair value positions in excess of certain thresholds. These agreements call for the posting of collateral in the form of cash, treasury securities or letters of credit if a fair value loss position to the Company or our counterparties exceeds a certain amount. There were no collateral balance requirements at January 1, 2011 or January 2, 2010. In addition to the commodity derivative instruments discussed above, we use long term contracts with suppliers to manage a portion of the price exposure associated with future purchases of certain raw materials, including rice, sugar, cartonboard, and corrugated boxes. It should be noted the exclusion of these contracts from the analysis above could be a limitation in assessing the net market risk of our Company. 26
