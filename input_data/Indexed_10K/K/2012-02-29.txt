ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Kellogg Company and Subsidiaries RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand Kellogg Company, our operations and our present business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item 8 of this report. Kellogg Company is the worlds leading producer of cereal and a leading producer of snacks and frozen food, including cookies, crackers, toaster pastries, cereal bars, fruit flavored snacks, frozen waffles, and veggie foods. Kellogg products are manufactured and marketed globally. On February 15, 2012 we announced that we entered into an agreement to acquire Procter & Gambles Pringles&reg; business for $2.695 billion which is expected to be funded by international cash and the issuance of approximately $2 billion of short and long term debt. The transaction is expected to close in the Summer of 2012, as such, we expect to have Pringles&reg; included in our results for approximately six months. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011, we report results of operations in the following reportable segments: U.S. Morning Foods & Kashi; U.S. Snacks; U.S. Specialty; North America Other; Europe; Latin America; and Asia Pacific. Segment results of prior periods were modified to conform to the current presentation. We currently manage our operations through nine operating segments that are based on product category or geographic location. These operating segments are evaluated for similarity with regards to economic characteristics, products, production processes, types or classes of customers, distribution methods and regulatory environments to determine if they can be aggregated into reportable segments. The reportable segments are discussed in greater detail within Note 16. We manage our Company for sustainable performance defined by our long term annual growth targets. These targets are 3 to 4% for internal net sales, mid single digit (4 to 6%) for internal operating profit, and high single digit (7 to 9%) for diluted net earnings per share (EPS) on a currency neutral basis. See the Foreign currency translation section for a discussion and reconciliation of currency neutral EPS, a non GAAP measure. For our full year 2011, internal net sales increased by 4% and reported net sales was up 6%. Consolidated internal operating profit was down 3% compared to the prior year. Reported operating profit decreased 1%. Diluted EPS was flat on a currency neutral basis. Reported EPS was $3.38, an increase of 2% over last years $3.30. Consolidated results(dollars in millions, exceptper share data) 2011 2010 2009 Net sales $ 13,198 $ 12,397 $ 12,575 Net sales growth: As reported 6.5 % (1.4 )% (1.9 )% Internal (a) 4.5 % (1.3 )% 3.0 % Operating profit $ 1,976 $ 1,990 $ 2,001 Operating profit growth: As reported (0.7 )% (0.6 )% 2.5 % Internal (a) (2.9 )% (0.1 )% 10.3 % Diluted net earningsper share (EPS) $ 3.38 $ 3.30 $ 3.16 EPS growth (b) 2 % 4 % 6 % Currency neutral diluted EPS growth (b) % 6 % 13 % (a) Internal net sales and operating profit growth for 2011 and 2010 exclude the impact of currency. Internal net sales and operating profit growth for 2009 exclude the impact of currency and acquisitions. Internal net sales and operating profit growth are non GAAP financial measures which are further discussed and reconciled to the directly comparable measures in accordance with U.S. GAAP in the Net sales and operating profit section. (b) See the section entitled Foreign currency translation for discussion and reconciliation of this non GAAP financial measure. 15 Net sales and operating profit 2011 compared to 2010 The following table provides an analysis of net sales and operating profit performance for 2011 versus 2010: (dollars in millions) U.S Morning Foods& Kashi U.S.Snacks U.S.Specialty North America Other Europe LatinAmerica Asia Pacific Corp orate Consoli dated 2011 net sales $3,635 $2,908 $ 955 $1,375 $ 2,334 $1,049 $942 $ $13,198 2010 net sales $3,480 $2,745 $ 916 $1,261 $ 2,230 $ 923 $842 $ $12,397 % change 2011 vs. 2010: Internal business (a) 4.4 % 6.0 % 4.2 % 6.7 % (.7 )% 10.3 % 4.1 % 4.5 % Foreign currency impact % % % 2.4 % 5.3 % 3.4 % 7.7 % 2.0 % Total change 4.4 % 6.0 % 4.2 % 9.1 % 4.6 % 13.7 % 11.8 % 6.5 % (dollars in millions) U.SMorning Foods& Kashi U.S.Snacks U.S.Specialty NorthAmerica Other Europe LatinAmerica AsiaPacific Corp orate (b) Consoli dated 2011 operating profit $648 $431 $216 $258 $338 $176 $106 $(197) $1,976 2010 operating profit $630 $475 $240 $220 $364 $153 $74 $(166) $1,990 % change 2011 vs. 2010: Internal business 3.0 % (9.1 )% (10.4 )% 13.9 % (12.5 )% 8.7 % 32.9 % (18.4 )% (2.9 )% Foreign currency impact (.2 )% % % 3.4 % 5.4 % 6.1 % 10.3 % % 2.2 % Total change 2.8 % (9.1 )% (10.4 )% 17.3 % (7.1 )% 14.8 % 43.2 % (18.4 )% (.7 )% (a) Growth rate includes volume and price/mix. (b) Research and Development expense totaling $11 million for 2010 was reallocated to Corporate from the North America businesses. Our consolidated net sales were up 6% on an as reported basis and up 4% on an internal basis behind favorable pricing/mix, approximately flat volume, and strong results from innovations across most markets. Innovations and solid execution contributed to share gains in our core cereal business as well as several other key categories. Additionally, the increased investment in our supply chain that began in 2010 and continued through 2011 is building a stronger foundation for future growth. Pricing was taken selectively throughout 2011 to offset the higher input costs we have experienced on many products across our categories around the world. Internal net sales for U.S. Morning Foods & Kashi increased 4% as a result of favorable pricing/mix and approximately flat volume. This business has two product groups: cereal and snacks. Cereals internal net sales increased by 5% resulting from strong innovation launches and reduced reliance on promotional spending. Dollar sales from our innovation in 2011 equaled the dollar sales from innovation introduced by all our competitors combined. Snacks (toaster pastries, Kashi branded cereal bars, crackers, cookies, Stretch Island fruit snacks, and health and wellness) internal net sales increased by 3% as a result of double digit growth in health and wellness and continued share gains in our Pop Tarts&reg; business. Internal net sales in U.S. Snacks increased by 6% as a result of favorable pricing/mix and approximately flat volume. This business consists of cookies, crackers, cereal bars, and fruit flavored snacks. The sales growth was the result of strong crackers consumption behind the launch of Special K Cracker Chips&reg; and Cheez it&reg; innovation which contributed to a solid improvement in our cracker category share. Sales also improved in wholesome snacks as a result of innovations in our Special K&reg; and FiberPlus&reg; cereal bars business. Cookies low single digit sales growth was favorably impacted by the launch of the Keebler&reg; master brand initiative in the second quarter which aligned pricing, packaging and scale across the Keebler&reg; brand. Internal net sales in U.S. Specialty increased by 4% as a result of favorable pricing/mix and approximately flat volume. Sales growth was due to frozen food innovation launches and cereal bar distribution gains. Internal net sales in North America Other (U.S. Frozen and Canada) increased by 7% due to mid single digit volume growth and favorable pricing/mix. Sales growth was the result of our U.S. Frozen business posting double digit growth for the year while gaining share as a result of increased brand building support behind innovation activity. Our International segments internal net sales were up 3% compared to the prior year as a result of favorable pricing/mix, partially offset by a decline in volume. Europes internal net sales declined 1% for the year 16 driven by a 3% decline in volume, partially offset by favorable pricing/mix. The operating environment in Europe continued to be difficult as a result of economic conditions and competitive activity. Sales growth in Russia was solid, as we continue to transition from a non branded to a branded product mix. Latin Americas internal net sales growth was 10% due to a slight increase in volume and double digit increase in pricing/mix. Latin America experienced growth in both cereal and snacks behind a mid double digit increase in brand building investment to support innovations. Internal net sales in Asia Pacific grew 4% as a result of favorable pricing/mix and approximately flat volume. Asia Pacifics growth was driven by strong performance across most of Asia, as well as South Africa. Consolidated operating profit declined by 1% on an as reported basis and was down 3% on an internal basis, when excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Operating profit for the year was negatively impacted by our supply chain investments, commodity inflation, and the reinstatement of our incentive compensation program as a result of our strong pay for performance orientation. Internal operating profit in U.S. Morning Foods & Kashi increased by 3%, U.S. Snacks declined by 9%, U.S. Specialty declined by 10%, North America Other grew by 14%, Europe declined by 13%, Latin America increased by 9% and Asia Pacific increased by 33%. U.S. Morning Foods & Kashis increase was attributable to strong sales in cereal and snacks, partially offset by increased incentive compensation expense, increased commodity costs and investments in supply chain. U.S. Snacks decline was attributable to investments in supply chain and increased incentive compensation expense. U.S. Specialtys decline was attributable to increased commodity costs and incentive compensation expense. Europes operating profit declined due to lower sales resulting from the continued difficult operating environment and increased commodity costs. The increase in Latin Americas operating profit is primarily a result of higher sales partially offset by increased brand building investment. Asia Pacifics operating profit growth was positively impacted by the prior year impairment charges related to our business in China. Refer to Note 2 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Corporate was impacted by higher compensation related expense. 2010 compared to 2009 The following table provides an analysis of net sales and operating profit performance for 2010 versus 2009: (dollars in millions) U.SMorning Foods& Kashi U.S.Snacks U.S.Specialty North America Other Europe LatinAmerica AsiaPacific Corp orate Consoli dated 2010 net sales $3,480 $2,745 $916 $1,261 $2,230 $923 $842 $ $12,397 2009 net sales $3,587 $2,758 $913 $1,252 $2,361 $963 $741 $ $12,575 % change 2010 vs. 2009: Internal business (a) (3.0 )% (.5 )% .3 % (3.4 )% (2.7 )% 4.8 % 2.0 % (1.3) % Foreign currency impact % % % 4.1 % (2.8 )% (8.9 )% 11.7 % (.1) % Total change (3.0 )% (.5 )% .3 % .7 % (5.5 )% (4.1 )% 13.7 % (1.4 )% (dollars in millions) U.S Morning Foods& Kashi U.S.Snacks U.S. Specialty North America Other Europe LatinAmerica AsiaPacific Corp orate (b) Consoli dated 2010 operating profit $630 $475 $240 $220 $364 $153 $74 $(166 ) $1,990 2009 operating profit $728 $436 $190 $228 $348 $179 $86 $(194 ) $2,001 % change 2010 vs. 2009: Internal business (13.5 )% 8.8 % 26.3 % (8.5 )% 8.2 % (2.4 )% (29.5 )% 14.5 % (.1 )% Foreign currency impact .1 % % % 5.0 % (3.4 )% (12.3 )% 15.2 % % (.5 )% Total change (13.4 )% 8.8 % 26.3 % (3.5 )% 4.8 % (14.7 )% (14.3 )% 14.5 % (.6 )% (a) Growth rate includes volume and price/mix. (b) Research and Development expense totaling $11 million for 2010 and $13 million for 2009 was reallocated to Corporate from the North America businesses. 17 Our consolidated net sales were down 1% on both a reported and internal basis, behind a 2% reduction in volume that was partially offset by favorable pricing/mix. There were three major issues that affected our results. First, our categories respond to innovation and brand building. We did not have sufficient cereal innovations in 2010. Rather, we focused on renovating our existing cereal products. We invested in renovation to improve the nutritional profile of our products. Secondly, we experienced supply chain disruptions in our waffle business and had a second quarter recall of select packages of breakfast cereals in our U.S. business. As a result, we increased investment in our supply chain to mitigate potential risks. Next, we experienced weakness in our core cereal businesses due to the competitive environment which drove price deflation into the cereal category. In late 2010 we announced price increases driven by higher input costs on many products across our categories around the world. Internal net sales for U.S. Morning Foods & Kashi declined 3% as a result of a 2% decline in volume and unfavorable pricing/mix. Cereals internal net sales declined by 6%. Our consumption was negatively impacted by the cereal recall that occurred in the second quarter of 2010. The brands involved in the recall were the cornerstone of our back to school promotions in the third quarter. Promotional pricing drove deflation into the category, but did not drive higher category volumes as would be expected. The U.S. cereal category responds well to innovation. While there were lower levels of innovation across the category in 2010, our innovations performed well. We were also impacted by less support from non measured channels. Trade inventory levels at the end of 2009 were higher than normal. As a result, our 2010 sales were negatively impacted as retailers sold through their inventory, reducing their purchases from us. Snacks internal net sales increased by 5% primarily driven by Pop Tarts&reg;. U.S. Snacks internal net sales declined slightly as a result of a 2% decline in volume, partially offset by favorable pricing/mix. The slight decline was driven by weak performance in cookies and, to a lesser extent, crackers. We were able to maintain our cracker category share in measured channels despite increased competitive promotional activity. Consumption in the cookie category was down for the year. Our cookie performance was also impacted by the loss of shelf space in non measured channels, which we were able to regain during the fourth quarter of 2010. This decline was partially offset by strong wholesome snack sales including our bar innovations such as FiberPlus&reg; and Special K Fruit Crisps&reg;. Internal net sales in North America Other decreased by 3% as a result of a 5% decline in volume, partially offset by favorable pricing/mix. Our sales were negatively impacted during the year due to the waffle supply disruption that began late in 2009. During 2010, we returned to full capacity and introduced new innovations. While the business rebounded slower than expected during 2010 as it took longer to re supply and reset retailer shelves, we reinstated brand building and the business responded positively. Our veggie business performed well, particularly Morningstar Farms&reg; burgers and entrees. Our International segments internal net sales were flat compared to the prior year as a result of a 1% improvement in pricing/mix which was offset by reduction in volume. Europes internal net sales declined 3% for the year which was primarily the result of volume decline. The cereal category (as measured by consumption) declined in our core European countries such as the U.K. Additionally, we saw price deflation in many food categories across Europe, especially in the U.K. Weakness in the Russia snack business due to transition from a non branded business to a branded business drove lower volumes and contributed to Europes lower top line results. Latin Americas internal net sales growth was 5% resulting from 8% favorable pricing/mix, partially offset by volume decline. The growth in cereal masked the decline in snacks. Our decline in snacks was largely driven by Venezuela where we import some products from Mexico. The imports were impacted by exchange rate controls and it was no longer cost efficient to import goods. Internal net sales in Asia Pacific grew 2% as a result of a 4% increase in volume, partially offset by unfavorable pricing/mix. Asia Pacifics growth was driven by strong performance across most of Asia, as well as South Africa. This was muted by a decline in Australia where the cereal category faced price deflation. Consolidated operating profit declined by 1% on an as reported basis and was flat on an internal basis, when excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Operating profit for the year was negatively impacted by the cereal recall, higher than expected commodity inflation and investments in our supply chain. Operating profit benefited from lower incentive compensation expense. Incentive compensation is based upon the Companys actual results compared to our target. Given results were lower than our targets, which were set at the beginning of 2010, incentive compensation decreased significantly compared to the prior year. Despite 2010s operating performance, we recognized the need to invest in advertising. Accordingly, we increased our spending in advertising by 4%, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Internal operating profit in U.S. Morning Foods & Kashi decreased by 14%, U.S. Snacks grew by 9%, U.S. Specialty increased 26%, North America Other declined by 9%, Europe grew by 8%, Latin America declined by 2% and Asia Pacific declined by 30%. U.S. Morning Foods & Kashis decline was attributable to lower sales in cereal. Competitive activity drove lower 18 cereal sales as did the second quarter cereal recall. These negative drivers were partially offset by higher sales in snacks primarily due to Pop Tarts&reg;, lower incentive compensation expense and decreased spending on cost reduction initiatives. U.S. Snacks increase was attributable to lower incentive compensation expense. U.S. Specialty increased due to lower incentive compensation costs and the favorable impact of cost reduction initiatives. Europes operating profit increased due to lower commodity costs and less spending on cost reduction initiatives. The decline in Latin Americas operating profit is primarily a result of higher commodity costs. Asia Pacifics operating profit was negatively impacted by the impairment charges related to our business in China. Refer to Note 2 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Corporate benefited from lower incentive compensation expense. Margin performance Margin performance was as follows: Change vs.prior year (pts.) 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 Gross margin (a) 41.3 % 42.7 % 42.9 % (1.4 ) (.2 ) SGA% (b) (26.3 )% (26.6 )% (27.0 )% .3 .4 Operating margin 15.0 % 16.1 % 15.9 % (1.1 ) .2 (a) Gross profit as a percentage of net sales. Gross profit is equal to net sales less cost of goods sold. (b) Selling, general, and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales. As illustrated in the preceding table, our consolidated gross margin declined by 140 basis points in 2011 due to the expanded investments in our supply chain, and increased cost pressures for fuel, energy, and commodities, which were partially offset by savings from cost reduction initiatives. Our selling, general and administrative (SGA) expense as a percentage of net sales decreased by 30 basis points primarily due to a reduction in brand building investment as a percent of net sales and decreased costs related to cost reduction initiatives, partially offset by increased incentive compensation expense. Our consolidated gross margin declined by 20 basis points in 2010 due to the cereal recall, increased cost pressures for fuel, energy, commodities and employee benefits and supply chain investments, which were more than offset by savings from cost reduction initiatives and lower up front costs recorded in cost of sales (COGS). Our SGA expense as a percentage of net sales decreased by 40 basis points primarily due to a reduction in incentive compensation expense and lower costs for cost reduction initiatives, which more than offset increased advertising investment and an impairment of goodwill. Foreign currency translation The reporting currency for our financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of our assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily in the Euro, British pound, Mexican peso, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates. As a result, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. This could have significant impact on our results if such increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar is substantial. Volatility in the foreign exchange markets has limited our ability to forecast future U.S. dollar reported earnings. As such, we are measuring diluted earnings per share growth and providing guidance on future earnings on a currency neutral basis, assuming earnings are translated at the prior years exchange rates. This non GAAP financial measure is being used to focus management and investors on local currency business results, thereby providing visibility to the underlying trends of the Company. Management believes that excluding the impact of foreign currency from EPS provides a useful measurement of comparability given the volatility in foreign exchange markets. Below is a reconciliation of reported EPS to currency neutral EPS for the fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009: Consolidated results 2011 2010 2009 Diluted net earnings per share (EPS) $ 3.38 $ 3.30 $ 3.16 Translational impact (a) (0.08 ) 0.04 0.22 Currency neutral EPS $ 3.30 $ 3.34 $ 3.38 Currency neutral EPS growth (b) % 6 % 13 % (a) Translation impact is the difference between reported EPS and the translation of current year net profits at prior year exchange rates, adjusted for gains (losses) on translational hedges, if applicable. (b) Calculated as a percentage of growth from the prior years reported EPS. Interest expense Annual interest expense for the 2009 to 2011 periods has trended downward. The decline in 2010 was due primarily to charges of approximately $35 million in 2009 for early redemption of long term debt and lower interest rates on our long term debt. Interest income (recorded in other income (expense), net) was (in millions), 2011 $11; 2010 $6; 2009 $4. 19 Income taxes Our reported effective tax rates for 2011, 2010 and 2009 were 29.0%, 28.8% and 28.2% respectively. The impact of discrete adjustments and the cost of remitted and unremitted foreign earnings reduced our effective income tax rate by 3 percentage points for 2011. For 2010 and 2009 the impact was a reduction of 3 and 2 percentage points, respectively. Refer to Note 11 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact the expected effective income tax rate as it is dependent upon U.S. dollar earnings of foreign subsidiaries doing business in various countries with differing statutory tax rates. Additionally, the rate could be impacted if pending uncertain tax matters, including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives, are resolved more or less favorably than we currently expect. Product withdrawal Refer to Note 13 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions. Our cash generating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs. We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our credit facilities and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that volatility and or disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us, or at all. On February 15, 2012 we announced that we entered into an agreement to acquire Procter & Gambles Pringles&reg; business for $2.695 billion which is expected to be funded by international cash and the issuance of approximately $2 billion of short and long term debt. The transaction is expected to close in the Summer of 2012, as such, we expect to have the Pringles&reg; business included in our results for approximately six months. We plan to decrease our share repurchase program while we pay down debt, but we are likely to repurchase shares to the extent of stock option exercise to offset the dilution effect. We also expect to maintain a strong investment grade rating and are committed to reducing debt levels to rebuild our financial flexibility. The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows: (dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,595 $ 1,008 $ 1,643 Investing activities (587 ) (465 ) (370 ) Financing activities (957 ) (439 ) (1,182 ) Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (35 ) 6 (12 ) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 16 $ 110 $ 79 Operating activities The principal source of our operating cash flows is net earnings, meaning cash receipts from the sale of our products, net of costs to manufacture and market our products. Our net cash provided by operating activities for 2011 amounted to $1,595 million, an increase of $587 million compared with 2010. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to lower pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions and lower payments for incentive compensation partially offset by a marginal increase in core working capital in 2011. Our net cash provided by operating activities for 2010 amounted to $1,008 million, a decrease of $635 million compared with 2009, reflecting higher pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions and increased payments for advertising and promotion in 2010. Our cash conversion cycle (defined as days of inventory and trade receivables outstanding less days of trade payables outstanding, based on a trailing 12 month average) is relatively short, equating to approximately 24 days for 2011, and 23 days for each of 2010 and 2009. Core working capital in 2011 averaged 6.9% of net sales, compared to 6.6% in 2010 and 6.5% in 2009. During 2011, core working capital was negatively impacted by higher days of inventory and higher days of trade receivables. Higher days of inventory was necessary to support our new product introductions and to maintain appropriate levels of service while investing in our supply chain infrastructure. Higher days of trade receivables resulted from strong sales at year end due to our innovation launches and Special K&reg; New Years resolution programs. During 2010, core working capital was negatively impacted by higher days of inventory needed to improve order fill levels, which was compounded by the impact of lower reported sales. Our total pension and postretirement benefit plan funding amounted to $192 million, $643 million and $100 million, in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we made incremental contributions to our pension and 20 postretirement benefit plans amounting to $563 million ($467 million, net of tax). The Pension Protection Act (PPA), and subsequent regulations, determines defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements in the United States. We believe that we will not be required to make any contributions under PPA requirements until 2014 or beyond. Our projections concerning timing of PPA funding requirements are subject to change primarily based on general market conditions affecting trust asset performance, future discount rates based on average yields of high quality corporate bonds and our decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the PPA. We currently project that we will make total U.S. and foreign benefit plan contributions in 2012 of approximately $50 million. Actual 2012 contributions could be different from our current projections, as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities, future changes in government requirements, trust asset performance, renewals of union contracts, or higher than expected health care claims cost experience. We measure cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions. We use this non GAAP financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment, dividend distributions, acquisition opportunities, and share repurchases. Our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measure, as follows: (dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,595 $ 1,008 $ 1,643 Additions to properties (594 ) (474 ) (377 ) Cash flow $ 1,001 $ 534 $ 1,266 year over year change 87.5 % (57.8 )% Year over year changes in cash flow (as defined) were driven by variations in both the amount of contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans and core working capital as well as changes in the level of capital expenditures during the three year period. Investing activities Our net cash used in investing activities for 2011 amounted to $587 million, an increase of $122 million compared with 2010 due to a higher level of capital expenditures in 2011. Capital spending in 2011 included investments in our supply chain infrastructure and to support capacity requirements in certain markets. In addition, we continued the investment in our information technology infrastructure related to the reimplementation and upgrade of our SAP platform. In 2010, we spent capital on our SAP platform and invested in our supply chain. In 2009, we invested in a new facility to manufacture ready to eat cereal in Mexico and completed the expansion of our global research center, one of the key incubators of innovation for our business, located in Battle Creek, Michigan. Net cash used in investing activities of $465 million in 2010 increased by $95 million compared with 2009, reflecting capital projects for our reimplementation and upgrade of our SAP platform and investments in our supply chain. Cash paid for additions to properties as a percentage of net sales has grown to 4.5% in 2011, from 3.8% in 2010, and 3.0% in 2009. Financing activities Our net cash used in financing activities for 2011, 2010 and 2009 amounted to $957 million, $439 million, and $1,182 million, respectively. Total debt was $6.0 billion at year end 2011 and $5.9 billion at year end 2010. In April 2011, we repaid $945 million ten year 6.60% U.S. Dollar Notes at maturity with commercial paper. In May 2011, we issued $400 million of seven year 3.25% fixed rate U.S. Dollar Notes, using the proceeds of $397 million for general corporate purposes and repayment of commercial paper. During 2011, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $400 million, which effectively converted these Notes from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation through maturity. The effective interest rate on these Notes, reflecting issuance discount and interest rate swaps was 2.31% in December 2011. In November 2011, we issued $500 million of five year 1.875% fixed rate U. S. Dollar Notes, using the proceeds of $498 million for general corporate purposes and repayment of commercial paper. The effective interest rate on these Notes, reflecting issuance discount and hedge settlement was 1.98% in December 2011. In December 2010, we issued $1.0 billion of ten year 4.0% fixed rate U.S. Dollar Notes, using a portion of the $987 million net proceeds to make incremental pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions. The proceeds were also used to retire commercial paper. The effective interest rate on these Notes, reflecting issuance discount and hedge settlement was 3.42% in December 2011. 21 In November 2009, we issued $500 million of ten year 4.15% fixed rate U.S. Dollar Notes, and used proceeds of $496 million to retire a portion of our 6.6% U.S. Dollar Notes due 2011. We retired $482 million of the 2011 debt, which had an effective interest rate of 7.08%, through a tender offer. In connection with the debt retirement, we recognized $35 million of interest expense and an acceleration of $3 million loss on an interest rate swap, which was previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. These charges were included in 2009 cash flows from operating activities. In May 2009, we issued $750 million of seven year 4.45% fixed rate U.S. Dollar Notes, and used proceeds of $745 million to pay down commercial paper. In May 2009, we also entered into interest rate swaps on $1,150 million of our debt. Interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $750 million effectively converted our 5.125% U.S. Dollar Notes due 2012 from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation for the remainder of the five year term. In addition, interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $400 million effectively converted a portion of our 6.6% U.S. Dollar Notes due 2011 from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation for the remaining term. In April 2010, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock amounting to $2.5 billion during 2010 through 2012. This three year authorization replaced previous share buyback programs which had authorized stock repurchases of up to $1.1 billion for 2010 and $650 million for 2009. Under these programs, we repurchased approximately 15 million, 21 million and 4 million shares of common stock for $793 million, $1.1 billion and $187 million during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We paid quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling $1.67 per share in 2011, $1.56 per share in 2010 and $1.43 per share in 2009. Total cash paid for dividends increased by 3.4% in 2011 and 7.0% in 2010. In March 2011, we entered into an unsecured Four Year Credit Agreement to replace our existing unsecured Five Year Credit Agreement which would have expired in November 2011. The Four Year Credit Agreement allows us to borrow, on a revolving credit basis, up to $2.0 billion. Our long term debt agreements contain customary covenants that limit the Company and some of its subsidiaries from incurring certain liens or from entering into certain sale and lease back transactions. Some agreements also contain change in control provisions. However, they do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings. A change in the Companys credit ratings could limit our access to the U.S. short term debt market and or increase the cost of refinancing long term debt in the future. However, even under these circumstances, we would continue to have access to our Four Year Credit Agreement, which expires in March 2015. This source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis, although we do not currently plan to use it. We plan to use a combination of commercial paper and future issuances of term debt to refinance our $750 million of debt maturing in the fourth quarter of 2012. Capital and credit markets, including commercial paper markets, continued to experience instability and disruption as the U.S. and global economies underwent a period of extreme uncertainty. Throughout this period of uncertainty, we continued to have access to the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper markets. Our commercial paper and term debt credit ratings were not affected by the changes in the credit environment. We monitor the financial strength of our third party financial institutions, including those that hold our cash and cash equivalents as well as those who serve as counterparties to our credit facilities, our derivative financial instruments, and other arrangements. We continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future, while still meeting our operational needs, including the pursuit of selected bolt on acquisitions. This will be accomplished through our strong cash flow, our short term borrowings, and our maintenance of credit facilities on a global basis. 22 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Off balance sheet arrangements As of December 31, 2011 and January 1, 2011 we did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements. Contractual obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2011: Contractual obligations Payments due by period (millions) Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 andbeyond Long term debt: Principal $ 5,763 $ 750 $ 752 $ 8 $ 1 $ 1,251 $ 3,001 Interest (a) 2,802 297 243 229 230 217 1,586 Capital leases (b) 5 1 1 1 1 1 Operating leases (c) 589 150 123 93 69 59 95 Purchase obligations (d) 999 832 73 44 35 15 Uncertain tax positions (e) 15 15 Other long term obligations (f) 1,008 90 68 91 191 326 242 Total $ 11,181 $ 2,135 $ 1,260 $ 466 $ 527 $ 1,868 $ 4,925 (a) Includes interest payments on our long term debt and payments on our interest rate swaps. Interest calculated on our variable rate debt was forecasted using the LIBOR forward rate curve as of December 31, 2011. (b) The total expected cash payments on our capital leases include interest expense totaling approximately $1 million over the periods presented above. (c) Operating leases represent the minimum rental commitments under non cancelable operating leases. (d) Purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments for raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business and for marketing, advertising and other services. The amounts presented in the table do not include items already recorded in accounts payable or other current liabilities at year end 2011, nor does the table reflect cash flows we are likely to incur based on our plans, but are not obligated to incur. Therefore, it should be noted that the exclusion of these items from the table could be a limitation in assessing our total future cash flows under contracts. (e) As of December 31, 2011, our total liability for uncertain tax positions was $66 million, of which $15 million, is expected to be paid in the next twelve months. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the remaining $51 million. (f) Other long term obligations are those associated with noncurrent liabilities recorded within the Consolidated Balance Sheet at year end 2011 and consist principally of projected commitments under deferred compensation arrangements, multiemployer plans, and supplemental employee retirement benefits. The table also includes our current estimate of minimum contributions to defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans through 2017 as follows: 2012 $50; 2013 $38; 2014 $76; 2015 $173; 2016 $294; 2017 $89. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Promotional expenditures Our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities such as in store displays and events, feature price discounts, consumer coupons, contests and loyalty programs. The costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded, which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure. The recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer. These estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs. Differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally insignificant and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. On a full year basis, these subsequent period adjustments generally represent less than 0.5% of our Companys net sales. However, our Companys total promotional expenditures (including amounts classified as a revenue reduction) represented approximately 40% of 2011 net sales; therefore, it is likely that our results would be materially different if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail. Property Long lived assets such as property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment when conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Management evaluates several conditions, including, but not limited to, the following: a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or an asset group; a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used, including an extended period of idleness; and a current expectation 23 that, more likely than not, a long lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. For assets to be held and used, we project the expected future undiscounted cash flows generated by the long lived asset or asset group over the remaining useful life of the primary asset. If the cash flow analysis yields an amount less than the carrying amount we determine the fair value of the asset or asset group by using comparable market data. There are inherent uncertainties associated with the judgments and estimates we use in these analyses. At December 31, 2011, we have property, plant and equipment of $3.3 billion, net of accumulated depreciation, on our balance sheet. Included in this amount are approximately $68 million of idle assets. The largest individual idle asset is a facility outside the United States which we tested for impairment on a held and used basis. The estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceeded the net book value of the facility as of December 31, 2011. Management estimates the plant will be deployed within the next several years. Should managements plan for deployment change, this could result in an impairment charge of up to $46 million based on the carrying value as of December 31, 2011. Goodwill and other intangible assets We perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually during the fourth quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual budgeting process. During the fourth quarter of 2011 we changed our reporting structure which altered the composition of the reporting units within the U.S. Morning Foods and Kashi operating segment. The changes resulted in the reassignment of the assets and liabilities to the reporting units impacted. The goodwill was allocated to the reporting units impacted using the relative fair value approach. Goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit with associated goodwill. Carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units. For the 2011 goodwill impairment test, the fair value of the reporting units was estimated based on market multiples. Our approach employs market multiples based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), earnings for companies comparable to our reporting units and discounted cash flows. Management believes the assumptions used for the impairment test are consistent with those utilized by a market participant performing similar valuations for our reporting units. Similarly, impairment testing of indefinite lived intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset. Fair values of non goodwill intangible assets are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset. For instance, cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales discounted at rates consistent with rates used by market participants. These estimates are made using various inputs including historical data, current and anticipated market conditions, management plans, and market comparables. We also evaluate the useful life over which a non goodwill intangible asset with a finite life is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the cash flows of the Company. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. At December 31, 2011, goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to $5.1 billion, consisting primarily of goodwill and trademarks associated with the 2001 acquisition of Keebler Foods Company. Within this total, approximately $1.4 billion of non goodwill intangible assets were classified as indefinite lived, comprised principally of Keebler trademarks. We currently believe that the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds their carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to the cash flows of the Company. At December 31, 2011, the fair value of our U.S. Snacks reporting unit exceeded its book value by $2.1 billion. However, if we had used materially different assumptions, which we do not believe are reasonably possible, regarding the future performance of our business or a different weighted average cost of capital in the valuation, this could have resulted in significant impairment losses. Additionally, we have $57 million of goodwill related to our 2008 acquisition of United Bakers in Russia. The percentage of excess fair value over carrying value of the Russian reporting unit was approximately 30% in both 2011 and 2010. If we used modestly different assumptions regarding sales multiples and EBITDA in the valuation, this could have resulted in an impairment loss. For example, if our projection of EBITDA margins had been lower by 200 basis points, this change in assumption may have resulted in impairment of some or all of the goodwill in the Russian reporting unit. Management will continue to monitor the situation closely. 24 Retirement benefits Our Company sponsors a number of U.S. and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the United States and Canada. Plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations and asset return performance. A substantial majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of debt securities and other investments. We recognize the cost of benefits provided during retirement over the employees active working life to determine the obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans. Inherent in this concept is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date. Major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the long term rates of return on plan assets, the health care cost trend rates, and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans, which cover employees in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. To conduct our annual review of the long term rate of return on plan assets, we model expected returns over a 20 year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans. The return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forward looking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on long term bonds, price earnings ratios of the major stock market indices, and long term inflation. Our U.S. plan model, corresponding to approximately 71% of our trust assets globally, currently incorporates a long term inflation assumption of 2.5% and an active management premium of 1% (net of fees) validated by historical analysis. Although we review our expected long term rates of return annually, our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. Our expected rates of return are generally not revised, provided these rates continue to fall within a more likely than not corridor of between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected long term returns, as determined by our modeling process. Our assumed rate of return for U.S. plans in 2011 of 8.9% equated to approximately the 62nd percentile expectation of our 2011 model. Similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets, reflecting local economic conditions. Foreign trust investments represent approximately 29% of our global benefit plan assets. Based on consolidated benefit plan assets at December 31, 2011, a 100 basis point reduction in the assumed rate of return would increase 2012 benefits expense by approximately $49 million. Correspondingly, a 100 basis point shortfall between the assumed and actual rate of return on plan assets for 2012 would result in a similar amount of arising experience loss. Any arising asset related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated value of plan assets over a five year period. Once recognized, experience gains and losses are amortized using a declining balance method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants, which for U.S. plans is presently about 12 years. Under this recognition method, a 100 basis point shortfall in actual versus assumed performance of all of our plan assets in 2012 would reduce pre tax earnings by approximately $1.8 million in 2013, increasing to approximately $9.0 million in 2017. For each of the three fiscal years, our actual return on plan assets exceeded (was less than) the recognized assumed return by the following amounts (in millions): 2011 $(478); 2010$208; 2009$507. To conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates, we model our actual claims cost data over a five year historical period, including an analysis of pre 65 versus post 65 age groups and other important demographic components in our covered retiree population. This data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends. Our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding short term future trends. In comparison to our actual five year compound annual claims cost growth rate of approximately 5.0%, our initial trend rate for 2012 of 6.1% reflects the expected future impact of faster growing claims experience for certain demographic groups within our total employee population. Our initial rate is trended downward by 0.5% per year, until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5% is reached. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Based on consolidated obligations at December 31, 2011, a 100 basis point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase 2012 benefits expense by approximately $17 million. A 100 basis point excess of 2012 actual health care claims cost over that calculated from the assumed trend rate would result in an arising experience loss of approximately $8 million. Any arising health care claims cost related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated amount of claims experience over a four year period. Once recognized, experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight line method over 15 years. The net experience gain arising from recognition of 2011 claims experience and adoption of an Employer Group Waiver Plan (EGWP) design for prescription drug costs was approximately $161 million. 25 To conduct our annual review of discount rates, we selected the discount rate based on a cash flow matching analysis using Towers Watsons proprietary RATE:Link tool and projections of the future benefit payments constituting the projected benefit obligation for the plans. RATE:Link establishes the uniform discount rate that produces the same present value of the estimated future benefit payments, as is generated by discounting each years benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year. The spot rates used in this process are derived from a yield curve created from yields on the 40th to 90th percentile of U.S. high quality bonds. A similar methodology is applied in Canada and Europe, except the smaller bond markets imply that yields between the 10th and 90th percentiles are preferable. The measurement dates for our defined benefit plans are consistent with our fiscal year end. Accordingly, we select discount rates to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during December of each year. Based on consolidated obligations at December 31, 2011, a 25 basis point decline in the weighted average discount rate used for benefit plan measurement purposes would increase 2012 benefits expense by approximately $16 million. All obligation related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants. Despite the previously described rigorous policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions, we periodically experience material differences between assumed and actual experience. As of December 31, 2011, we had consolidated unamortized prior service cost and net experience losses of approximately $2.3 billion, compared to approximately $1.7 billion at January 1, 2011. Of the total unamortized amounts at December 31, 2011, approximately $1.9 billion was related to asset losses that occurred during 2008 and 2011, offset by $0.7 billion in asset gains during 2009 and 2010, with the remainder largely related to discount rate reductions and health care claims experience. For 2012, we currently expect total amortization of prior service cost and net experience losses to be approximately $34 million higher than the actual 2011 amount of approximately $142 million. Total employee benefit expense for 2012 is expected to be higher than 2011 due to lower discount rates, phase in of the 2008 and 2011 investment losses, offset by better than expected 2009 and 2010 investment performance. During 2011 we made contributions in the amount of $180 million to Kelloggs global tax qualified pension programs. This amount was mostly discretionary. Additionally we contributed $12 million to our retiree medical programs. Assuming actual future experience is consistent with our current assumptions, annual amortization of accumulated prior service cost and net experience losses during each of the next several years would increase versus the 2011 amount. Income taxes Our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The calculation of our income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgment. Income taxes are provided on the portion of foreign earnings that is expected to be remitted to and taxable in the United States. We recognize tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that the positions will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. For tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefits as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, new or emerging legislation and tax planning. The tax position will be derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained. Significant adjustments to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits impacting our effective tax rate are separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of Note 11 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO BE ADOPTED IN FUTURE PERIODS Presentation of Comprehensive Income In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new accounting standard requiring most entities to present items of net income and other comprehensive income either in one continuous statement referred to as the statement of comprehensive income or in two separate, but consecutive, statements of net income and other comprehensive income. The update does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income. The new standard included a requirement to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component on the face of the financial statements. In December, 2011, the reclassification requirement within the new standard was indefinitely deferred. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011 and should be applied 26 retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We will adopt the new standard at the beginning of our 2012 fiscal year. Goodwill impairment testing In September 2011, the FASB issued an updated accounting standard allowing entities the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Under the updated standard an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The updated standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt the updated standard in connection with our annual goodwill impairment evaluation in the fourth quarter of 2012. FUTURE OUTLOOK On February 15, 2012 we announced that we entered into an agreement to acquire Procter & Gambles Pringles&reg; business for $2.695 million which is expected to be funded by international cash and the issuance of approximately $2 billion of short and long term debt. The transaction is expected to close in the Summer of 2012, as such we expect having Pringles included in our results for approximately six months. We anticipate in 2012 we will continue to set the foundation for future growth as a result of price realization and mix improvement driven by innovation and supported by increased investment in brand building. Earnings per share on a currency neutral basis is expected to grow by 2 to 4 percent, prior to the impact of the Pringles&reg; acquisition which is expected to be dilutive to 2012 earnings per share by $0.11 to 0.16 including one time costs and changes to the share repurchase program. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our Company is exposed to certain market risks, which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations. We use derivative financial and commodity instruments, where appropriate, to manage these risks. As a matter of policy, we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions. Refer to Note 12 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our derivative financial and commodity instruments. Foreign exchange risk Our Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related primarily to third party purchases, intercompany transactions, and when applicable, nonfunctional currency denominated third party debt. Our Company is also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments. Additionally, our Company is exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency denominated earnings to U.S. dollars. Primary exposures include the U.S. dollar versus the euro, British pound, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, and Mexican peso, and in the case of inter subsidiary transactions, the British pound versus the euro. We assess foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational volatility and may enter into forward contracts, options, and currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in long or short currency positions. Forward contracts and options are generally less than 18 months duration. Currency swap agreements may be established in conjunction with the term of underlying debt issuances. The total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at year end 2011 was $1,265 million, representing a settlement obligation of $7 million. The total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at year end 2010 was $1,075 million, representing a settlement obligation of $20 million. All of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions, translational exposure, or existing assets or liabilities, and mature within 18 months. Assuming an unfavorable 10% change in year end exchange rates, the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately $127 million at year end 2011 and $108 million at year end 2010. These unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures. Venezuela was designated as a highly inflationary economy as of the beginning of our 2010 fiscal year. Gains and losses resulting from the translation of the financial statements of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in earnings. As of the end of our 2009 fiscal year, we used the parallel rate to translate our Venezuelan subsidiarys financial statements to U.S. dollars. In May 2010, the Venezuelan government effectively eliminated the parallel market. In June 2010, several large Venezuelan commercial banks began operating the Transaction System for Foreign Currency Denominated Securities (SITME). Accordingly, we began using the SITME rate as of January 1, 2011 to translate our Venezuelan subsidiarys financial statements to U.S. dollars. During 2010, we recorded a $3 million foreign exchange gain in other income (expense), net, associated with the translation of our subsidiarys financials into U.S. dollars, with no impact during 2011. On a consolidated basis, Venezuela represents less than 2% of our business; therefore, any ongoing impact is expected to be immaterial. Interest rate risk Our Company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future issuances of variable rate debt. 27 Primary exposures include movements in U.S. Treasury rates, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), and commercial paper rates. We periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs associated with certain debt issues, and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt, based on current and projected market conditions. During 2011 and 2009, we entered into interest rate swaps in connection with certain U.S. Dollar Notes. Refer to disclosures contained in Note 6 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The total notional amount of interest rate swaps at year end 2011 was $600 million, representing a settlement receivable of $23 million. The total notional amount of interest rate swaps at year end 2010 was $1.9 billion, representing a settlement receivable of $74 million. Assuming average variable rate debt levels during the year, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by approximately $18 million at year end 2011 and $21 million at year end 2010. Price risk Our Company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials, fuel, and energy. Primary exposures include corn, wheat, soybean oil, sugar, cocoa, cartonboard, natural gas, and diesel fuel. We have historically used the combination of long term contracts with suppliers, and exchange traded futures and option contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted raw material purchases over a duration of generally less than 18 months. During 2006, we entered into two separate 10 year over the counter commodity swap transactions to reduce fluctuations in the price of natural gas used principally in our manufacturing processes. The notional amount of the swaps totaled $104 million as of December 31, 2011 and equates to approximately 50% of our North America manufacturing needs over the remaining hedge period. At year end January 1, 2011 the notional amount was $125 million. The total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at year end 2011, including the North America natural gas swaps, was $175 million, representing a settlement obligation of approximately $48 million. The total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at year end 2010, including the natural gas swaps, was $379 million, representing a settlement obligation of approximately $16 million. Assuming a 10% decrease in year end commodity prices, the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately $12 million at year end 2011, and $36 million at year end 2010, generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases. In some instances the Company has reciprocal collateralization agreements with counterparties regarding fair value positions in excess of certain thresholds. These agreements call for the posting of collateral in the form of cash, treasury securities or letters of credit if a net liability position to the Company or our counterparties exceeds a certain amount. As of December 31, 2011, we had posted collateral of $2 million in the form of cash, which was reflected as an increase in accounts receivable, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. There was no collateral balance requirement at January 1, 2011. In addition to the commodity derivative instruments discussed above, we use long term contracts with suppliers to manage a portion of the price exposure associated with future purchases of certain raw materials, including rice, sugar, cartonboard, and corrugated boxes. It should be noted the exclusion of these contracts from the analysis above could be a limitation in assessing the net market risk of our Company. 28
