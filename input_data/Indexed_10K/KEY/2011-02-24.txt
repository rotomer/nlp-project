These terms are defined in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) which begins on page 99. 28 Table of Contents Introduction This section generally reviews the financial condition and results of operations of KeyCorp and its subsidiaries for each of the past three years. Some tables may include additional periods to comply with disclosure requirements or to illustrate trends in greater detail. When you read this discussion, you should also consult the consolidated financial statements and related notes in this report. The page locations of specific sections that we refer to are presented in the preceding table of contents. Terminology Throughout this discussion, references to Key, we, our, us and similar terms refer to the consolidated entity consisting of KeyCorp and its subsidiaries. KeyCorp refers solely to the parent holding company, and KeyBank refers to KeyCorps subsidiary bank, KeyBank National Association. We want to explain some industry specific terms at the outset so you can better understand the discussion that follows. In September 2009, we decided to discontinue the education lending business. In April 2009, we decided to wind down the operations of Austin Capital Management, Ltd., a subsidiary that specialized in managing hedge fund investments for institutional customers. As a result of these decisions, we have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations. We use the phrase continuing operations in this document to mean all of our businesses other than the education lending business and Austin. Our exit loan portfolios are separate from our discontinued operations. These portfolios, which are in a run off mode, stem from product lines we decided to cease because they no longer fit with our corporate strategy. These exit loan portfolios are included in Other Segments. We engage in capital markets activities primarily through business conducted by our Key Corporate Bank segment. These activities encompass a variety of products and services. Among other things, we trade securities as a dealer, enter into derivative contracts (both to accommodate clients financing needs and for proprietary trading purposes), and conduct transactions in foreign currencies (both to accommodate clients needs and to benefit from fluctuations in exchange rates). For regulatory purposes, capital is divided into two classes. Federal regulations currently prescribe that at least one half of a bank or bank holding companys total risk based capital must qualify as Tier 1 capital. Both total and Tier 1 capital serve as bases for several measures of capital adequacy, which is an important indicator of financial stability and condition. As described in the section entitled Economic Overview, in 2010, the regulators initiated an additional level of review of capital adequacy for the countrys nineteen largest banking institutions, including KeyCorp. This regulatory assessment continued during 2010 and 2011. As part of this capital adequacy review, banking regulators evaluated a component of Tier 1 capital, known as Tier 1 common equity. For a detailed explanation of total capital, Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common equity, and how they are calculated see the section entitled Capital. During the first quarter of 2010, we re aligned our reporting structure for our segments. Previously, the Consumer Finance business group consisted mainly of portfolios that were identified as exit or run off portfolios and were included in our Key Corporate Bank segment. We are now reflecting these exit portfolios in Other Segments. The automobile dealer floor plan business, previously included in Consumer Finance, has been re aligned with the Commercial Banking line of business within the Key Community Bank segment. In addition, other previously identified exit portfolios included in the Key Corporate Bank segment, including our homebuilder loans from the Real Estate Capital line of business and commercial leases from the Equipment Finance line of business, have been moved to Other Segments. For more detailed financial information pertaining to each segment and its respective lines of business, see Note 21 (Line of Business Results). Long term financial goals Our long term financial goals are as follows: Target a loan to core deposit ratio range of 90% to 100%. Return to a moderate risk profile by targeting a net charge off ratio range of .40% to .50%. Grow high quality and diverse revenue streams by targeting a net interest margin in excess of 3.50% and noninterest income to total revenue of greater than 40%. Create positive operating leverage and complete Keyvolution run rate savings goal of $300 million to $375 million by the end of 2012. Achieve a return on average assets in the range of 1.00% to 1.25%. Figure 1 shows the evaluation of our long term financial goals for the fourth quarter of 2010. 29 Table of Contents Figure 1.

Corporate strategy We remain committed to enhancing shareholder value by having a strong balance sheet, consistent earnings growth, and a focus on risk adjusted returns. We are achieving these goals by implementing our client insight driven relationship strategy, which is built on enduring relationships, client focused solutions with extraordinary client service, and a robust risk management culture. Our 2010/2011 strategic priorities for enhancing shareholder value and for creating sustainable long term value were as follows: Drive sustainable, profitable growth through disciplined execution. We strive for continuous improvement in our business. We continue to focus on increasing revenues, controlling costs, and returning to a moderate risk profile in our loan portfolios. Further, we will continue to leverage technology and other workforce initiatives to achieve these objectives. Expand, retain and acquire client relationships. We work to deepen relationships with existing clients and to build targeted relationships with new clients, particularly those that have the potential to purchase multiple products and services or to generate repeat business. We aim to better understand our clients and to devise better ways to meet their needs by regularly seeking client feedback and using those insights to improve our products and services. We will strengthen the alignment between our Key Corporate Bank and Key Community Bank to ensure we deliver the whole array of products and services to our clients. Our relationship strategy and commitment to extraordinary service serve as the foundation for everything we do. Operate within a robust risk management culture. We will continue to align our risk tolerances with our corporate strategies and goals, and increase risk awareness throughout the company. Our employees must have a clear understanding of our risk tolerance with regard to factors such as asset quality, operational risk and liquidity levels to ensure that we operate within our desired risk appetite. Sustain strong reserves, capital and liquidity. We intend to stay focused on sustaining strong reserves and capital, which we believe is important not only in todays environment, but also to support future growth opportunities. We also remain committed to maintaining strong liquidity and funding positions. Attract and retain a capable, diverse and engaged workforce. We are committed to investing in our workforce to optimize the talent in our organization. We will continue to stress the importance of training, retaining, developing and challenging our employees. We believe this is essential to succeeding on all of our priorities. 30 Table of Contents Strategic developments We initiated the following actions during 2010 and 2009 to support our corporate strategy: During the fourth quarter of 2010, we announced that Henry L. Meyer will retire on May 1, 2011, and that Beth E. Mooney was elected President and Chief Operating Officer of KeyCorp and a member of KeyCorps Board of Directors. Mooney will assume the additional role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on May 1, 2011, and become the first woman CEO of a top 20 U.S. bank. Mooney, who has over 30 years of experience in retail banking, commercial lending, and real estate financing, was previously Vice Chair of KeyCorp and head of Keys Community Bank business. Three consecutive profitable quarters in 2010 and profit for the entire year. This positive trend was due to higher pre provision net revenue and a lower provision for loan and lease losses. The growth in pre provision net revenue was the result of a higher net interest margin and net interest income, well controlled expenses and improvements in several fee based businesses. We scored significantly higher than our four largest banking competitors in a third quarter of 2010 customer satisfaction survey conducted by the American Customer Satisfaction Index. Our scores were significantly better than bank industry scores across the multiple dimensions, most notably in Customer Loyalty. Our asset quality metrics significantly improved across the majority of our loan portfolios as we proactively addressed credit quality issues. Nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans decreased. Additionally, net loan charge offs declined compared to the prior year. Our balance sheet continues to reflect strong capital, liquidity and reserve levels. In August 2010, we issued $750 million of 5 year senior unsecured debt at the holding company. During 2010 and 2009, we opened 77 new branches and renovated approximately 145 others. We expect to open 35 40 new branches in 2011 as part of our long term plan to modernize and strengthen our presence in select markets. During 2009, we settled all outstanding federal income tax issues with the IRS for the tax years 1997 2006, including all outstanding leveraged lease tax issues for all open tax years. During the third quarter of 2009, we decided to exit the government guaranteed education lending business, following earlier actions taken in the third quarter of 2008 to cease private student lending. As a result of this decision, we have accounted for the education lending business as a discontinued operation. Additionally, we ceased conducting business in both the commercial vehicle and office equipment leasing markets. During the second quarter of 2009, we decided to wind down the operations of Austin, a subsidiary that specialized in managing hedge fund investments for institutional customers. As a result of this decision, we have accounted for this business as a discontinued operation. In late 2008, we began a corporate wide initiative designed to build a consistently superior experience for our clients, simplify processes, improve speed to market, and enhance our ability to seize growth and profit opportunities. As of December 31, 2010, we have achieved $228 million of the targeted run rate savings toward our goal of achieving $300 million to $375 million by the end of 2012. Over the past three years, we have been exiting certain noncore businesses, such as retail marine and education lending, and have been modernizing our 14 state branch network, coupled with enhancing our online banking to provide clients with a breadth of options that meet their specific banking needs. As a result of these and other efforts, over the last two years, our workforce has been reduced by 2,485 average full time equivalent employees. Economic overview The strength of the economic recovery in the United States varied throughout 2010; however, the year ended with a positive tone. During the first quarter, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased 3.7%, the second biggest quarterly increase since the recession began in December of 2007. GDP growth continued into the second and third quarters, although at a lower level. The average quarterly GDP growth of 2.7% for the first three quarters of 2010 represents a significant improvement from the 2009 average quarterly change in GDP of .25% and also outpaces the ten year average of 1.7%. Growth in 2010 was supported by businesses rebuilding inventory levels and capital spending on equipment and software. Growth was also sustained by increasing contributions from consumer spending, which grew at an average monthly rate of .3% for 2010, matching the rate of growth in 2009. Despite the strength in consumer spending, employers remained reluctant to add a significant number of employees to payrolls. U.S. payrolls increased by .9 million during 2010, compared to a decline of 5.1 million in 2009. 2010 was the first year of job growth since the recession began. Over 8 million Americans lost their jobs during the recession. The unemployment rate declined to 9.4% in December of 2010, compared to 9.9% in December of 2009. 31 Table of Contents Housing continued to be a drag on consumer wealth in 2010 as home buying activity declined after the expiration of the homebuyer tax credit, offered as part of the The Worker, Homeownership and Business Assistance Act of 2009. Historically low mortgage rates were not enough to attract buyers. Sales of existing homes declined by 3% in 2010 compared to a 15% rise in 2009. The median price of existing homes in December 2010 declined 1% from December 2009, compared to a 3% annual decline a year earlier. A reduced level of foreclosures helped to stabilize existing home prices. The number of foreclosures in December 2010 declined 26% from the December 2009 level. New home sales declined by 8% in 2010, compared to a 6% decline in 2009. The median price of new homes increased by 8%. New home construction in December 2010 declined 8% from the same month in 2009. Due to an improved economic outlook and functioning of the financial markets, the Federal Reserve ceased its purchases of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities and closed most of its emergency liquidity facilities during the first quarter of 2010. As the economic outlook moderated during the second and third quarters, the Federal Reserve decided at the November Federal Open Market Committee meeting to reinstate quantitative easing through additional agency security purchases. The Federal Reserve also held the federal funds target rate near zero throughout all of 2010. Benchmark term interest rates declined during 2010 due to these Federal Reserve actions and expectations of a slow economic recovery. During 2010, investors sought the safety of Treasury securities at times of heightened fears related to the European sovereign debt crisis. As a result of these factors, the benchmark two year Treasury yield decreased to .60% at December 31, 2010, from 1.14% at December 31, 2009, and the ten year Treasury yield decreased to 3.30% at December 31, 2010 from 3.84% at December 31, 2009. Regulatory Reform Developments On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd Frank Act into law. This Act is intended to address perceived deficiencies and gaps in the regulatory framework for financial services in the United States, reduce the risks of bank failures and better equip the nations regulators to guard against or mitigate any future financial crises, and manage systemic risk through increased supervision of systemically important financial companies (including nonbank financial companies). The Dodd Frank Act implements numerous and far reaching changes across the financial landscape affecting financial companies, including banks and bank holding companies such as Key. For a review of the various changes that the Dodd Frank Act implements, see the Supervision and Regulation Regulatory Reform in Item 1. Business of this report. Many of the rulemakings required by the various regulatory agencies are still in the process of being developed and or implemented. Interchange Fees On December 16, 2010, the Federal Reserve released proposed rules governing interchange fees that merchants pay to banks when consumers make purchases with their debit cards (the proposal). The proposal would implement provisions of the Dodd Frank Act. The proposal was open for public comment through February 22, 2011, with the Federal Reserve expecting implementation of any proposed interchange fee standards by July 21, 2011, should the proposal be adopted. As previously announced, we currently estimate that approximately $100 million in debit interchange revenue could be impacted by the proposal. Until the regulations are finalized by the Federal Reserve, it is premature to assess the impact on this combined revenue stream of the proposal. It is possible that the effect could be significant to the revenue we derive from these activities. Regulation E pursuant to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978 During the third quarter of 2010, the Federal Reserves final rules regarding Regulation E became effective. Regulation E is designed to protect consumers by prohibiting unfair practices and improving disclosures to consumers. Regulation E became effective July 1, 2010, for new clients and on August 15, 2010, for existing clients. Regulation E, among other items, prohibits financial institutions from charging overdraft fees to a client without receiving consent from the client to opt in to the financial institutions overdraft services for ATM and everyday debit card transactions. Based on the number of clients whom have opted in, we estimate the impact to us was an annualized decline of approximately $40 million in our deposit service charge income during the fourth quarter of 2010. This decline is consistent with our previously reported expectations. However, this amount is subject to change as additional clients make their overdraft decisions. FDIC Rulemaking Developments Several significant developments have impacted Deposit Insurance Assessments. Substantially all of KeyBanks domestic deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. The FDIC assesses an insured depository institution an amount for deposit insurance premiums equal to its deposit insurance assessment base times a risk based assessment rate. Under the risk based assessment system in effect during 2010, annualized deposit insurance premium assessments ranged from $.07 to $.775 for each $100 of assessable domestic deposits based on the institutions risk category. This system will remain in effect for the first quarter of 2011. In 2009, the FDIC amended its assessment regulations to require insured depository institutions to prepay, on December 30, 2009, their estimated quarterly assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009, and for all of 2010, 2011, and 2012. 32 Table of Contents The amount of KeyBanks assessment prepayment was $539 million. For 2010, our FDIC insurance assessment was $124 million. As of December 31, 2010, we had $388 million of prepaid FDIC insurance assessment recorded on our balance sheet. The Dodd Frank Act requires the FDIC to change the assessment base from domestic deposits to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity, and requires the DIF reserve ratio to increase to 1.35% by September 30, 2020, rather than 1.15% by December 31, 2016, as previously required. To implement these and other changes to the current deposit insurance assessment regime, the FDIC issued several proposed rules in 2010. On February 7, 2011, the FDIC adopted their final rule on assessments. Under the final rule, which is effective on April 1, 2011, KeyBanks annualized deposit insurance premium assessments would range from $.025 to $.45 for each $100 of its new assessment base, depending on its new scorecard performance incorporating KeyBanks regulatory rating, ability to withstand asset and funding related stress, and relative magnitude of potential losses to the FDIC in the event of KeyBanks failure. We estimate that our 2011 expense for deposit insurance assessments will be $60 to $90 million. Demographics We have two major business segments: Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank. The effect on our business of continued volatility and weakness in the housing market varies with the state of the economy in the regions in which these business segments operate. Key Community Bank serves consumers and small to mid sized businesses by offering a variety of deposit, investment, lending and wealth management products and services. These products and services are provided through a 14 state branch network organized into three internally defined geographic regions: Rocky Mountains and Northwest, Great Lakes, and Northeast. Commercial and industrial loan growth in our middle market portfolio is improving. We are particularly encouraged as we experienced commercial loan growth during the fourth quarter of 2010 in the Northeast region. Trends are improving in the Great Lakes, Rocky Mountains and Northwest regions as the economic recovery migrates across the country. Merger and acquisition activity is also increasing and we expect businesses to begin to draw on their available credit facilities and cash to make investments in their production capabilities that have been postponed over the past several years. Figure 2 shows the geographic diversity of our Key Community Bank segments average core deposits, commercial loans and home equity loans. Figure 2.

Key Corporate Bank includes three lines of business that operate nationally, within and beyond our 14 state branch network, as well as internationally. The Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services business consists of two business units. Real Estate Capital provides lending, debt placements, servicing, and equity and investment banking services to developers, brokers and owner investors dealing primarily with nonowner occupied properties. Corporate Banking provides a full array of commercial banking products and cash management services. Equipment Finance meets the equipment leasing needs of companies worldwide and provides equipment manufacturers, distributors and resellers with funding options for their clients. The Institutional and Capital Markets business consists of two business units. KeyBanc Capital Markets provides commercial lending, treasury management, investment banking, derivatives, foreign exchange, equity and debt underwriting and trading, and 33 Table of Contents syndicated finance products and services to large corporations and middle market companies. Victory Capital Management manages or offers advice regarding investment portfolios for a national client base. Additional information regarding the products and services offered by our Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank segments are described further in this report in Note 21 (Line of Business). Since the beginning of the financial crisis, results for Key Corporate Bank have been adversely affected by increasing credit costs and volatility in the capital markets. In 2010, credit losses in the Key Corporate Bank declined and the overall recovery in the equity markets led to growth in the market values of assets under management, and stability in the market value of other assets (primarily commercial real estate loans and securities held for sale or trading). We saw market liquidity strengthen in the latter half of 2010. We used this as an opportunity to continue to sell certain of our nonperforming assets. We were encouraged by the fact that we were able to sell these assets at prices that were close to their carrying value as recorded on our books. Figure 22, which appears later in this report in the Loans and loans held for sale section, shows the diversity of our commercial real estate lending business based on industry type and location. As previously reported, we have ceased all new lending to homebuilders and, since December 31, 2007, we have reduced outstanding balances in the residential properties portion of the commercial real estate construction loan portfolio by $3 billion, or 85%, to $525 million. Additional information about loan sales is included in the Credit risk management section. Critical accounting policies and estimates Our business is dynamic and complex. Consequently, we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies. These choices are critical; not only are they necessary to comply with GAAP, they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance. All accounting policies are important, and all policies described in Note 1 should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance. In our opinion, some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility. These policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance, or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. Because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances, they may prove to be inaccurate, or we may find it necessary to change them. We rely heavily on the use of judgment, assumptions and estimates to make a number of core decisions. A brief discussion of each of these areas follows. Allowance for loan and lease losses The loan portfolio is the largest category of assets on our balance sheet. We consider a variety of data to determine probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio and to establish an allowance that is sufficient to absorb those losses. For example, we apply historical loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions, lending policies, underwriting standards, and the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets. Other considerations include expected cash flows and estimated collateral values. For all TDRs, regardless of size, as well as all other impaired loans with an outstanding balance greater than $2.5 million, we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate. For example, a specific allowance may be assigned even when sources of repayment appear sufficient if we remain uncertain that the loan will be repaid in full. We continually assess the risk profile of the loan portfolio and adjust the allowance for loan and lease losses when appropriate. The economic and business climate in any given industry or market is difficult to gauge and can change rapidly, and the effects of those changes can vary by borrower. However, since our total loan portfolio is well diversified in many respects, and the risk profile of certain segments of the loan portfolio may be improving while the risk profile of others is deteriorating, we may decide to change the level of the allowance for one segment of the portfolio without changing it for any other segment. At December 31, 2010, the Key Community Bank reporting unit had $917 million in goodwill, while the Key Corporate Bank reporting unit had no recorded goodwill. In addition to adjusting the allowance for loan and lease losses to reflect market conditions, we also may adjust the allowance because of unique events that cause actual losses to vary abruptly and significantly from expected losses. For example, class action lawsuits brought against an industry segment (e.g., one that used asbestos in its product) can cause a precipitous deterioration in the risk profile of borrowers doing business in that segment. Conversely, the dismissal of such lawsuits can improve the risk profile. In either case, historical loss rates for that industry segment would not have provided a precise basis for determining the appropriate level of allowance. 34 Table of Contents Even minor changes in the level of estimated losses can significantly affect managements determination of the appropriate level of allowance because those changes must be applied across a large portfolio. To illustrate, an increase in estimated losses equal to one tenth of one percent of our consumer loan portfolio as of December 31, 2010, would indicate the need for a $16 million increase in the level of the allowance. The same level of increase in estimated losses for the commercial loan portfolio would result in a $35 million increase in the allowance. Such adjustments to the allowance for loan and lease losses can materially affect financial results. Following the above examples, a $16 million increase in the consumer loan portfolio allowance would have reduced our earnings on an after tax basis by approximately $10 million, or $.01 per share; a $35 million increase in the commercial loan portfolio allowance would have reduced earnings on an after tax basis by approximately $22 million, or $.02 per share. As we make decisions regarding the allowance, we benefit from a lengthy organizational history and experience with credit evaluations and related outcomes. Nonetheless, if our underlying assumptions later prove to be inaccurate, the allowance for loan and lease losses would likely need to be adjusted, possibly having an adverse effect on our results of operations. Our accounting policy related to the allowance is disclosed in Note 1 under the heading Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses. Valuation methodologies Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted the applicable accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. In the absence of quoted market prices, we determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities using internally developed models, which are based on third party data as well as our judgment, assumptions and estimates regarding credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and other relevant market available inputs. We describe our adoption of this accounting guidance, the process used to determine fair values and the fair value hierarchy in Note 1 under the heading Fair Value Measurements and in Note 6 (Fair Value Measurements). At December 31, 2010, $25.3 billion, or 28%, of our total assets were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Substantially all of these assets were classified as Level 1 or Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. At December 31, 2010, $2.2 billion, or 3%, of our total liabilities were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Substantially all of these liabilities were classified as Level 1 or Level 2. At December 31, 2010, $296 million, or 0.3%, of our total assets were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Approximately 13% of these assets were classified as Level 1 or Level 2. At December 31, 2010, there were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Valuation methodologies often involve significant judgment, particularly when there are no observable active markets for the items being valued. To determine the values of assets and liabilities, as well as the extent to which related assets may be impaired, we make assumptions and estimates related to discount rates, asset returns, prepayment rates and other factors. The use of different discount rates or other valuation assumptions could produce significantly different results. The outcomes of valuations that we perform have a direct bearing on the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities, including loans held for sale, principal investments, goodwill, and pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. A discussion of the valuation methodology applied to our loans held for sale is included in Note 1 under the heading Loans Held for Sale. Our principal investments include direct and indirect investments, predominantly in privately held companies. The fair values of these investments are determined by considering a number of factors, including the target companys financial condition and results of operations, values of public companies in comparable businesses, market liquidity, and the nature and duration of resale restrictions. The fair value of principal investments was $898 million at December 31, 2010; a 10% positive or negative variance in that fair value would have increased or decreased our 2010 earnings by approximately $90 million ($56 million after tax, or $.06 per share). The valuation and testing methodologies used in our analysis of goodwill impairment are summarized in Note 1 under the heading Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The first step in testing for impairment is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit. Our reporting units for purposes of this testing are our two major business segments: Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank. Fair values are estimated using comparable external market data (market approach) and discounted cash flow modeling that incorporates an appropriate risk premium and earnings forecast information (income approach). We perform a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit as appropriate. We believe the estimates and assumptions used in the goodwill impairment analysis for our reporting units are reasonable. However, if actual results and market conditions differ from the assumptions or estimates used, the fair value of each reporting unit could change in the future. The second step of impairment testing is necessary only if the carrying amount of either reporting unit exceeds its fair value, suggesting goodwill impairment. In such a case, we would estimate a hypothetical purchase price for the reporting unit 35 Table of Contents (representing the units fair value) and then compare that hypothetical purchase price with the fair value of the units net assets (excluding goodwill). Any excess of the estimated purchase price over the fair value of the reporting units net assets represents the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss would be recognized as a charge to earnings if the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill. As a result of our sale of Tuition Management Systems in December 2010, customer relationship intangible assets of $15 million were written off against the purchase price to determine the net gain during 2010. During 2009, we recorded noncash charges for intangible assets impairment of $241 million ($192 million after tax, or $.28 per common share). See Note 10 (Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets) for a summary of the events that resulted in these charges. Due to the economic uncertainty experienced since 2007, we have conducted quarterly reviews of the applicable goodwill impairment indicators and evaluated the carrying amount of our goodwill, as necessary. The primary assumptions used in determining our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and related expenses, including sensitivity analysis of these assumptions, are presented in Note 19 (Employee Benefits). When potential asset impairment is identified, we must exercise judgment to determine the nature of the potential impairment (i.e., temporary or other than temporary) to apply the appropriate accounting treatment. For example, unrealized losses on securities available for sale that are deemed temporary are recorded in shareholders equity; those deemed other than temporary are recorded in either earnings or shareholders equity based on certain factors. Additional information regarding temporary and other than temporary impairment on securities available for sale at December 31, 2010, is provided in Note 7 (Securities). Derivatives and hedging We use primarily interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk for asset and liability management purposes. These derivative instruments modify the interest rate characteristics of specified on balance sheet assets and liabilities. Our accounting policies related to derivatives reflect the current accounting guidance, which provides that all derivatives should be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value, after taking into account the effects of master netting agreements. Accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a particular derivative depends on whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship, and further, on the type of hedging relationship. The application of hedge accounting requires significant judgment to interpret the relevant accounting guidance, as well as to assess hedge effectiveness, identify similar hedged item groupings, and measure changes in the fair value of the hedged items. We believe our methods of addressing these judgments and applying the accounting guidance are consistent with both the guidance and industry practices. However, interpretations of the applicable accounting guidance continue to change and evolve. In the future, these evolving interpretations could result in material changes to our accounting for derivative financial instruments and related hedging activities. Although such changes may not have a material effect on our financial condition, a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which it occurs. Additional information relating to our use of derivatives is included in Note 1 under the heading Derivatives and Note 8 (Derivatives and Hedging Activities). Contingent liabilities, guarantees and income taxes Contingent liabilities arising from litigation and from guarantees in various agreements with third parties under which we are a guarantor, and the potential effects of these items on the results of our operations, are summarized in Note 16 (Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees). We record a liability for the fair value of the obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of a guarantee, but there is a risk that our actual future payments in the event of a default by the guaranteed party could exceed the recorded amount. See Note 16 for a comparison of the liability recorded and the maximum potential undiscounted future payments for the various types of guarantees that we had outstanding at December 31, 2010. It is not always clear how the Internal Revenue Code and various state tax laws apply to transactions that we undertake. In the normal course of business, we may record tax benefits and then have those benefits contested by the IRS or state tax authorities. We have provided tax reserves that we believe are adequate to absorb potential adjustments that such challenges may necessitate. However, if our judgment later proves to be inaccurate, the tax reserves may need to be adjusted, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and capital. Additionally, we conduct quarterly assessments that determine the amount of deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized, and therefore recorded. The available evidence used in connection with these assessments includes taxable income in prior periods, projected future taxable income, potential tax planning strategies and projected future reversals of deferred tax items. These assessments are subjective and may change. Based on these criteria, and in particular our projections for future taxable income, we currently believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize our net deferred tax asset in future periods. However, changes to the evidence used in our assessments could have a material adverse effect on our results of 36 Table of Contents operations in the period in which they occur. For further information on our accounting for income taxes, see Note 12 (Income Taxes). During 2010, we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related assumptions and estimates. Highlights of Our 2010 Performance Financial performance For 2010, we announced net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $390 million, or $.47 per Common Share. These results compare to a net loss from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $1.629 billion, or $2.27 per Common Share, for 2009. Figure 3 shows our continuing and discontinued operating results for the past three years. Our financial performance for each of the past six years is summarized in Figure 4. Figure 3.

In April 2009, we decided to wind down the operations of Austin, a subsidiary that specialized in managing hedge fund investments for institutional customers. As a result of these decisions, we have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations. The loss from discontinued operations in 2010 was primarily attributable to fair value adjustments related to the education lending securitization trusts. Included in the loss from discontinued operations in 2009 is a charge for intangible assets impairment related to Austin. The earnings improvement in 2010 resulted from improved pre provision net revenue and a lower provision for loan and lease losses when compared to 2009. Results in 2009 were adversely impacted by an elevated provision for loan and lease losses, write offs of certain intangible assets and write downs of certain commercial real estate related investments. With three consecutive profitable quarters, and continued signs of increased economic activity on the part of our clients, we believe that we are positioned well to compete with other businesses in 2011. Our core financial measures strong capital, enhanced liquidity, adequate loan and lease loss reserves, as well as our exit from riskier lending categories represent a firm foundation for the year ahead. Net interest margin from continuing operations was 3.26% for 2010. This was an increase of 43 basis points from 2009. This increase was primarily due to lower funding costs, which began in the latter part of 2009. We continue to experience an improvement in our mix of deposits by reducing the level of higher costing certificates of deposit and growing lower costing transaction accounts. This benefit to the net interest margin was partially offset by a lower level of average earning assets compared to the same period one year ago resulting from pay downs on loans. During 2009, our net interest margin was under pressure as the federal funds target rate was at low levels throughout the year. This resulted in a larger decrease in interest rates on earning assets than that experienced on interest bearing liabilities. 37 Table of Contents We saw an increase in loan demand within our core commercial client base during the fourth quarter of 2010. Excluding the impact of our exit portfolios, our commercial and industrial and leasing portfolios both experienced loan growth for the first time since the fall of 2008. However, there can be no assurance this will continue in 2011, as many clients have sufficient liquidity resources to meet current operating needs. In 2010, credit quality also continued to improve across the majority of the loan portfolios in both Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank. Net loan charge offs and nonperforming loans declined each quarter during 2010. At December 31, 2010, nonperforming assets stood at their lowest level since the third quarter of 2008. Net charge offs for 2010 were $1.6 billion, a decrease of $687 million from 2009. During the same period, commercial loan net charge offs decreased by $673 million, primarily driven by lower charge offs from the commercial real estate construction portfolio. At December 31, 2010, our nonperforming loans totaled $1.1 billion and represented 2.13% of period end portfolio loans, compared to 3.72% at December 31, 2009. Nonperforming assets at December 31, 2010 totaled $1.3 billion and represented 2.66% of portfolio loans, OREO and other nonperforming assets, compared to $2.5 billion and 4.25% at December 31, 2009. Most of the reduction came from nonperforming loans in the commercial, financial and agricultural, the real estate commercial mortgage, and the real estate construction portfolios. Our exit loan portfolio accounted for $210 million, or 15.70%, of total nonperforming assets at December 31, 2010, compared to $599 million, or 23.86%, at December 31, 2009. Our allowance for loan and lease losses decreased to $1.6 billion from $2.6 billion one year ago. At December 31, 2010, our allowance represented 3.20% of total loans and 150.19% of nonperforming loans compared to 4.31% and 115.87%, respectively at December 31, 2009. One of our primary areas of focus has been to reduce our exposure to the higher risk segments of our commercial real estate portfolio. In addition, we are continuing to work down the loan portfolios that have been identified for exit to improve our risk adjusted returns. Further information pertaining to our progress in reducing our commercial real estate exposure and our exit loan portfolio is presented in the section entitled Credit risk management. At December 31, 2010, our Tier 1 common equity and Tier 1 risk based capital ratios were 9.34% and 15.16%, compared to 7.50% and 12.75%, respectively at December 31, 2009. In 2009, we completed a series of successful transactions that generated approximately $2.4 billion of new Tier I common equity to strengthen our overall capital. Additionally, we made significant progress on strengthening our liquidity and funding positions during 2010 while in the midst of weak loan demand and a soft economy. Our consolidated average loan to deposit ratio was 90% for the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to 97% for the fourth quarter of 2009. This improvement was accomplished by growing our noninterest bearing deposits, NOW and money market deposits, reducing our reliance on wholesale funding, exiting nonrelationship businesses and increasing the portion of our earning assets invested in highly liquid securities. During 2010, we originated approximately $29.5 billion in new or renewed lending commitments. Over the last two years, we have opened 77 new branches and renovated approximately 145 others, expanding Keys 14 state branch network to 1,033 branches. Further, we plan to build an additional 35 40 new branches in 2011. We also recently announced that we scored significantly higher than our four largest competitor banks in a third quarter of 2010 customer satisfaction survey conducted by the American Customer Satisfaction Index. Our scores were significantly better than bank industry scores across multiple dimensions, most notably in Customer Loyalty. 38 Table of Contents Figure 4.

Figure 5 reconciles certain GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non GAAP measures, which provides a basis for period to period comparisons. (b) In September 2009, we decided to discontinue the education lending business conducted through Key Education Resources, the education payment and financing unit of KeyBank. In April 2009, we decided to wind down the operations of Austin, a subsidiary that specialized in managing hedge fund investments for institutional customers. We sold the subprime mortgage loan portfolio held by the Champion Mortgage finance business in November 2006, and completed the sale of Champions origination platform in February 2007. As a result of these actions and decisions, we have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations. (c) Certain financial data for periods prior to 2007 have not been adjusted to reflect the effect of our January 1, 2008, adoption of new accounting guidance regarding the offsetting of amounts related to certain contracts. Figure 5 presents certain financial measures related to tangible common equity and Tier 1 common equity. The tangible common equity ratio has been a focus for some investors. We believe this ratio may assist investors in analyzing our capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. Since the commencement of the SCAP in early 2009, the Federal Reserve has focused its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of Tier 1 risk based capital known as Tier 1 common equity. Because the Federal Reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders equity (essentially Tier 1 risk based capital less preferred stock, qualifying capital securities and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries) generally should be the dominant element in Tier 1 risk based capital, this focus on Tier 1 common equity is consistent with existing capital adequacy categories. This increased focus on Tier 1 common equity is also present in the Basel Committees Basel III guidelines, which U.S. regulators are expected to adopt pursuant to regulations expected to be issued in the summer of 2011. The enactment of the Dodd Frank Act also changes the regulatory capital standards that apply to bank holding companies by requiring regulators to create rules phasing out the treatment of capital securities and cumulative preferred securities (excluding TARP CPP preferred stock issued to the United States or any federal government entity before October 4, 2010) being treated as Tier 1 eligible capital. This three year phase out period, which commences January 1, 2013, will ultimately result in our capital securities being treated only as Tier 2 capital. Tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by GAAP nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations; this measure is considered to be a non GAAP financial measure. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity and Tier 1 common equity, we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases. Figure 5 also reconciles the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non GAAP measures. The table also shows the computation for pre provision net revenue, which is not formally defined by GAAP. Management believes that eliminating the effects of the provision for loan and lease losses makes it easier to analyze our results by presenting them on a more comparable basis. Non GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP. 40 Table of Contents Figure 5.

Line of Business Results This section summarizes the financial performance and related strategic developments of our two major business segments (operating segments), Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank. During the first quarter of 2010, we re aligned our reporting structure for our business segments. Prior to 2010, Consumer Finance consisted mainly of portfolios that were identified as exit or run off portfolios and were included in our Key Corporate Bank segment. Effective for all periods presented, we are reflecting the results of these exit portfolios in Other Segments. The automobile dealer floor plan business, previously included in Consumer Finance, has been re aligned with the Commercial Banking line of business within the Key Community Bank segment. In addition, other previously identified exit portfolios included in the Key Corporate Bank segment have been moved to Other Segments.

Results for 2009 also include a $32 million ($20 million after tax) gain from the sale of our claim associated with the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy and a $105 million ($65 million after tax) gain from the sale of our remaining equity interest in Visa Inc. Reconciling Items for 2008 include $120 million of previously accrued interest recovered in connection with our opt in to the IRS global tax settlement and total charges of $505 million to income taxes for the interest cost associated with the leveraged lease tax litigation. Also, during 2008, Reconciling Items include a $165 million ($103 million after tax) gain from the partial redemption of our equity interest in Visa Inc. and a $17 million charge to income taxes for the interest cost associated with the increase to our tax reserves for certain LILO transactions. Key Community Bank summary of operations As shown in Figure 7, Key Community Bank recorded net income attributable to Key of $161 million for 2010, compared to a net loss of $56 million for 2009, and net income of $356 million for 2008. The increase in 2010 was the result of improvements in noninterest income, reductions in noninterest expense, and a significant decrease in the provision for loan and lease losses. Taxable equivalent net interest income declined by $104 million, or 6%, from 2009 as a result of a decrease in average earning assets, a decline in average deposits, and tighter deposit spreads. Average loans and leases declined by $2.7 billion, or 9%, due to reductions in the commercial loan and home equity portfolios, while average deposits declined $2.9 billion, or 6%. The decrease in average deposits reflects a strong mix shift in the portfolio, as average certificates of deposit declined $7 billion in 2010. Higher costing certificates of deposit originated in prior years matured and repriced to current market rates, partially offset by growth in noninterest bearing deposits and NOW accounts. Noninterest income increased by $18 million, or 2%, from 2009 due in part to an increase in trust and investment services income of $20 million. Derivative revenue increased $21 million from 2009, due primarily to a reduction in the provision for credit losses from client derivatives. In addition, electronic banking fees increased $12 million, or 11% from 2009. These positive results were offset in part by a $28 million decrease in service charges on deposit accounts, resulting from both changes in customer behavior and the implementation of Regulation E. The provision for loan and lease losses declined by $318 million, or 44%, from 2009. Key Community Banks provision in excess of charge offs for loan and lease losses declined by $372 million from 2009 reflecting improving economic conditions from one year ago. The improvement in this provision was partially offset by a $54 million increase in net loan charge offs. Noninterest expense decreased by $106 million, or 6%, from 2009, due in part to a $40 million decrease in the FDIC deposit insurance assessment. Also contributing to the year over year change in noninterest expense was a charge of $21 million recorded to the provision for losses on lending related commitments in 2009, compared to a credit of $20 million recorded in 2010. Finally, corporate allocated costs declined $52 million. The improvement in these areas was partially offset by higher business services and professional fees reflecting the cost of our third party mortgage operations and the continued investment in our branch network. Over the last two years, we have opened 77 new branches and renovated approximately 145 others as part of our branch modernization initiative. In 2009, the $412 million decrease in net income attributable to Key was due in part to an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses of $452 million, coupled with a decrease in noninterest income of $57 million. In addition, noninterest expense 42 Table of Contents increased $157 million, primarily due to an increase in FDIC deposit insurance expense. These changes more than offset a $15 million increase in net interest income. Figure 7.

The 2010 improvement was primarily due to a substantial decrease in the provision for loan and lease losses, improvement in noninterest income, and a decrease in noninterest expense. This improvement was moderated by a decline in net interest income that resulted from a reduction in average earning assets. Taxable equivalent net interest income declined by $77 million, or 9%, in 2010 compared to 2009, due primarily to a reduction in average earning assets, offset in part by improved earning asset yields and an increase in deferred loan fees. Average earning assets fell by $7.1 billion, or 24%, due primarily to reductions in the commercial loan portfolios. Average deposits declined by $484 million, or 4%. Noninterest income increased by $170 million, or 24%, from 2009, due in part to net gains on certain commercial real estate investments. During 2010, these gains on certain commercial real estate investments totaled $7 million as compared to losses of $137 million in 2009 which reflected reductions in the fair values of certain commercial real estate related investments made by the Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services line of business. Also contributing to the improvement in noninterest 43 Table of Contents income was a $48 million improvement in net losses from loan sales, a $29 million improvement in investment banking income, and a $28 million gain from the sale of Tuition Management Systems in December 2010. The growth in noninterest income was offset in part by a $35 million decrease in trust and investment services income which was primarily due to reduced brokerage commissions in the Institutional and Capital Markets line of business. Noninterest income was also adversely impacted by a $29 million decline in operating lease revenue and a $13 million decrease in letter of credit fees. The provision for loan and lease losses declined by $1.854 billion from 2009, reflecting lower levels of net loan charge offs, primarily from the commercial loan portfolio. Key Corporate Banks provision for loan and lease losses was less than net loan charge offs by $635 million as we continued to experience improved asset quality. During 2009, noninterest expense was adversely affected by intangible asset impairment charges totaling $241 million. These charges resulted from reductions in the estimated fair value of the Key Corporate Bank reporting unit caused by weakness in the financial markets and the write off of other intangible assets related to our leasing operation. Excluding these intangible asset charges, noninterest expense declined by $86 million, or 8%, from 2009, due primarily to a $21 million credit to provision for losses on lending related commitments recorded during 2010, compared to a $45 million charge recorded in 2009. A $20 million decline in operating lease expense, lower FDIC deposit insurance assessment, and a decrease in internally allocated overhead and support costs also contributed to the decrease in noninterest expense. These factors were partially offset by a $20 million increase in OREO expense, and increases in both personnel expense and miscellaneous expense. In 2009, results were less favorable than they were in 2008 due to a $38 million, or 4%, reduction in net interest income, an $11 million, or 2%, decrease in noninterest income, and a $1.322 billion increase in the provision for loan and lease losses and a $121 million, or 10%, increase in noninterest expense. Noninterest expense in 2008 included an intangible asset impairment charge of $217 million compared to the $241 million charge in 2009 and a $7 million credit provision for losses on lending related commitments compared to the $45 million charge in 2009. Consistent with our strategy to focus on core relationship businesses, we sold Tuition Management Systems in December 2010. Figure 8.

These exit portfolios were moved to Other Segments during the first quarter of 44 Table of Contents 2010. Prior periods have been adjusted to conform to the current reporting of the financial information for each segment. Other Segments generated a net loss attributable to Key of $14 million for 2010, compared to a net loss attributable to Key of $359 million for 2009. The results reflect a $277 million increase in net interest income and a decrease in the loan loss provision of $331 million. Noninterest income results declined $173 million as increases in net gains from principal investing (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests) of $70 million, net gains on loan sales of $23 million and income from corporate owned life insurance of $22 million were more than offset by declines in net securities gains of $126 million, gains on sales of leased equipment of $75 million and net gains of $78 million related to the exchange of common shares for capital securities during 2009. Noninterest expense results declined $110 million as OREO expense decreased $46 million, operating lease expense decreased $31 million and support and overhead charges decreased $20 million. In 2009, Other Segments generated a net loss attributable to Key of $359 million, compared to a net loss attributable to Key of $1.2 billion for 2008. The results reflect a $564 million increase in net interest income and a decrease in the loan loss provision of $165 million. In 2008, net interest income was negatively impacted as a result of certain leveraged lease financing transactions that were challenged by the IRS. Noninterest income results improved $315 million as a result of increases in net securities gains of $125 million, net gains of $78 million related to the exchange of common shares for capital securities during 2009, gains on sales of leased equipment of $55 million and net gains from principal investing (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests) of $51 million. Noninterest expense results declined $197 million as the OREO expense increase of $54 million was more than offset by a decline in various other expense categories. Results of Operations Net interest income One of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets (such as loans and securities) and loan related fee income, and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings. There are several factors that affect net interest income, including: the volume, pricing, mix and maturity of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities; the volume and value of net free funds, such as noninterest bearing deposits and equity capital; the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk; interest rate fluctuations and competitive conditions within the marketplace; and asset quality. To make it easier to compare results among several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets (some taxable, some not), we present net interest income in this discussion on a taxable equivalent basis (i.e., as if it were all taxable and at the same taxable rate). For example, $100 of tax exempt income would be presented as $154, an amount that if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% would yield $100. Figure 9 shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense, and their respective yields or rates over the past six years. This figure also presents a reconciliation of taxable equivalent net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with GAAP for each of those years. The net interest margin, which is an indicator of the profitability of the earning assets portfolio less cost of funding, is calculated by dividing net interest income by average earning assets. Taxable equivalent net interest income for 2010 was $2.537 billion, and the net interest margin was 3.26%. These results compare to taxable equivalent net interest income of $2.406 billion and a net interest margin of 2.83% for the prior year. The increase in the 2010 net interest margin is primarily attributable to lower funding costs. We continue to experience an improvement in the mix of deposits by reducing the level of higher costing certificates of deposit and growing lower costing transaction accounts. This benefit to the net interest margin was partially offset during 2010 by a lower level of average earning assets compared to the prior year resulting primarily from pay downs on loans. We also experienced improved yields on loans due to lower levels of nonperforming loans. Compared to the prior year, funding costs were also reduced by maturities of long term debt and the 2009 exchanges of capital securities for our Common Shares. In the prior year, the net interest margin remained under pressure as the federal funds target rate was at low levels. This resulted in a larger decrease in the interest rates on earning assets than that experienced for interest bearing liabilities. Further compression of the 2009 net interest margin came from higher levels of nonperforming assets and the termination of certain leveraged lease financing arrangements. Average earning assets for 2010 totaled $78.4 billion, which was $6.7 billion, or 8%, lower than the 2009 level. This reduction reflects a $12.4 billion decrease in loans during the year, caused by soft demand for credit, paydowns on our portfolios as 45 Table of Contents commercial clients deleveraged, and the run off in our exit portfolios. The decline in loans was partially offset by an increase of $7.6 billion in securities available for sale. The size and composition of our loan portfolios were affected by the following actions during 2010 and 2009: We sold $1.2 billion of commercial real estate loans during 2010 and $1.3 billion during 2009. Since some of these loans have been sold with limited recourse (i.e., there is a risk that we will be held accountable for certain events or representations made in the sales agreements), we established and have maintained a loss reserve in an amount that we believe is appropriate. More information about the related recourse agreement is provided in Note 16 (Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees) under the heading Recourse agreement with FNMA. In addition to the sales of commercial real estate loans discussed above, we sold other loans totaling $2 billion (including $1.6 billion of residential real estate loans) during 2010 and $1.8 billion (including $1.5 billion of residential real estate loans) during 2009. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we transferred loans with a fair value of $82 million from held for sale status to the held to maturity portfolio as a result of current market conditions and our related plans to restructure the terms of these loans. We sold $487 million of education loans (included in discontinued assets on the balance sheet) during 2010, and $474 million during 2009. In late September 2009, we decided to exit the government guaranteed education lending business and have applied discontinued operations accounting to the education lending business for all periods presented in this report. We transferred $193 million of loans ($248 million, net of $55 million in net charge offs) from the held to maturity loan portfolio to held for sale status in late September 2009, in conjunction with additional actions taken to reduce our exposure in the commercial real estate and institutional portfolios through the sale of selected assets. Most of these loans were sold during October 2009. 46 Table of Contents (This page intentionally left blank) 47 Table of Contents Figure 9.

(e) Discontinued liabilities include the liabilities of the education lending business and the dollar amount of any additional liabilities assumed necessary to support the assets associated with this business. (f) During the fourth quarter of 2008, our taxable equivalent net interest income was reduced by $18 million as a result of an agreement reached with the IRS on all material aspects related to the IRS global tax settlement pertaining to certain leveraged lease financing transactions. During the second quarter of 2008, our taxable equivalent net interest income was reduced by $838 million following an adverse federal court decision on our tax treatment of a leveraged sale leaseback transaction. During the first quarter of 2008, we increased our tax reserves for certain LILO transactions and recalculated our lease income in accordance with prescribed accounting standards. These actions reduced our first quarter 2008 taxable 49 Table of Contents equivalent net interest income by $34 million. Excluding all of these reductions, the taxable equivalent yield on our commercial lease financing portfolio would have been 4.82% for 2008, and our taxable equivalent net interest margin would have been 3.13%. (g) Yield is calculated on the basis of amortized cost. (h) Rate calculation excludes basis adjustments related to fair value hedges. Figure 10 shows how the changes in yields or rates and average balances from the prior year affected net interest income.

Noninterest income Noninterest income for 2010 was $1.954 billion, down $81 million, or 4%, from 2009. In 2009, noninterest income increased by $188 million, or 10%, compared to 2008. Several significant items affected noninterest income in 2010 and 2009. In 2010, we realized a gain of $28 million from the sale of Tuition Management Systems, which is recorded in miscellaneous income. In 2009, significant items include net gains of $125 million from the repositioning of the securities portfolio, $78 million recorded in connection with the exchange of Common Shares for capital securities, $32 million from the sale of our claim associated with the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy and $105 million gain from the sale of Visa Inc. shares. Excluding the above items, noninterest income for 2010 increased by $231 million. As shown in Figure 11, we benefited from a $187 million increase in investment banking and capital market income, $76 million in net gains from loan sales in 2010 compared to a $1 million loss in 2009, and $66 million in net gains from principal investing (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests) in 2010 compared to a $4 million loss in 2009. These favorable results were partially offset by a $79 million decline in net gains on sale of leased equipment. Significant items also influence a comparison of noninterest income for 2009 with that reported for 2008. We recorded a $105 million gain from the sale of Visa Inc. shares in 2009, compared to a $165 million gain from the partial redemption of Visa shares during 2008. Excluding the above items, noninterest income for 2009 increased by $13 million. As shown in Figure 11, we benefited from an $81 million reduction in net losses from loan sales, a $59 million increase in net gains on sales of leased equipment, a $50 million decrease in net losses from principal investing (including results attributable to noncontrolling interest) and an increase in other income, due primarily to mortgage banking activities and the volatility associated with the hedge accounting applied to debt instruments. These factors were substantially offset by less favorable results from investment banking and capital 50 Table of Contents market activities, as well as reductions in trust and investment services income, service charges on deposit accounts and operating lease income.

Trust and investment services income Trust and investment services are our largest source of noninterest income. The primary components of revenue generated by these services are shown in Figure 12. The 2010 decrease of $15 million, or 3%, is primarily attributable to lower fixed income sales reflected in brokerage commissions and fees. The increase in personal asset management and custody fees is largely offset by the impact of outflows in security lending assets and money market mutual funds reflected in institutional asset management and custody fees. In 2009, we experienced a decrease of $50 million, or 10%, in trust and investment services income, which is attributable to reductions in both institutional and personal asset management income, as well as lower income from brokerage commissions and fees.

At December 31, 2010, our bank, trust and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management of 51 Table of Contents $59.8 billion, compared to $66.9 billion at December 31, 2009. As shown in Figure 13, most of the decrease was attributable to reductions in the securities lending and money market portfolios, offset by an increase in the equity portfolio. The decline in the securities lending portfolio was due to relatively flat equity market activities, a decline on spreads, and client departures. When clients securities are lent out, the borrower must provide us with cash collateral, which is invested during the term of the loan. The difference between the revenue generated from the investment and the cost of the collateral is shared with the lending client. This business, although profitable, generates a significantly lower rate of return (commensurate with the lower level of risk) than other types of assets under management. The decline in the money market portfolio was due in part to the low rate environment as clients look for higher yields in other investment strategies. The decrease in the value of our portfolio of hedge funds is attributable to our second quarter 2009 decision to wind down the operations of Austin. Figure 13.

Service charges on deposit accounts The 2010 decrease in service charges on deposit accounts is due primarily to changing client behaviors involving lower overdraft transactions, which generate overdraft fees as well as a decline in other deposit service charge related fees. A recent component of the decrease was due to the implementation of Regulation E, which went into effect on July, 1, 2010 for new clients and August 15, 2010 for our existing clients. The decrease in service charges on deposit accounts associated with existing Regulation E rules was in line with our expectations. The decrease from 2008 to 2009 was due primarily to lower overdraft transactions, which generated fewer overdraft fees. Additionally, because of the prevailing low interest rates and unlimited FDIC insurance, our corporate clients maintained larger amounts on deposit, which has the effect of reducing transaction service charges on their noninterest bearing deposit accounts. Operating lease income Reduced originations of operating leases in 2010 were due to the related economics and resulted in a $54 million decrease in operating equipment leases recorded in the Equipment Finance line of business. Accordingly, as shown in Figure 15, depreciation expense associated with operating leases also declined. The $43 million decrease in 2009 operating lease income is also due to reduced originations. Investment banking and capital markets income (loss) As shown in Figure 14, income from investment banking and capital markets activities increased $187 million in 2010. Other investment income increased $109 million from 2009 resulting from lower losses from changes in the fair value of certain investments made by our Funds Management Group within Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services line of business in Key Corporate Bank. At December 31, 2010, these securities had a carrying amount of approximately $1 million, representing 3% of their face value. Dealer trading and derivative losses decreased $54 million from 2009 due largely to a $36 million decrease in the provision for losses related to customer derivatives and $14 million decrease related to credit default 52 Table of Contents swap valuation adjustments. Investment banking income also increased $29 million due primarily to increased levels of debt and equity financings. The 2009 decline was driven by losses related to certain commercial real estate related investments, primarily due to changes in their fair values. Net losses from investments made by the Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services line of business rose by $68 million from 2008. We also experienced a $36 million increase in losses associated with dealer trading and derivatives, due largely to credit default swap valuation adjustments. Figure 14.

During 2010, we recorded $76 million of net gains from loan sales, compared to net losses of $1 million during 2009. We saw market liquidity strengthen beginning in the latter half of 2010 and took the opportunity to continue to sell our nonperforming loans. We were encouraged by the fact that we were able to sell these assets at values close to their carrying values recorded on our books. The types of loans sold during 2010 and 2009 are presented in Figure 22. Net gains (losses) from principal investing Principal investments consist of direct and indirect investments in predominantly privately held companies. Our principal investing income is susceptible to volatility since most of it is derived from mezzanine debt and equity investments in small to medium sized businesses. These investments are carried on the balance sheet at fair value ($898 million at December 31, 2010, and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2009). We had $66 million in gains from principal investing for 2010, as presented in Figure 11. These gains are derived largely from changes in fair values, in our indirect and venture capital areas, as well as sales of principal investments. Noninterest expense As shown in Figure 15, noninterest expense for 2010 was $3.034 billion, down $520 million, or 15%, from 2009. In 2009, noninterest expense rose by $78 million, or 2% from 2008. In 2010, personnel expense decreased by $43 million. Excluding intangible assets impairment charges of $241 million, nonpersonnel expense decreased by $279 million due primarily to a $115 million decrease in provision for losses on lending related commitments, a $53 million decrease in FDIC assessment expense, a $53 million decrease in operating lease expense and a $29 million decrease in OREO expense. The decrease in provision for losses on lending related commitments is due to a $48 million credit during 2010 as a result of improved credit quality and a lower level of unfunded commitments. FDIC assessment expense decreased because we recorded a one time special assessment in the second quarter of 2009, the result of opting out of the TAG program effective July 1, 2010 and because insured deposits decreased. OREO expense decreased as a result of improved liquidity for income producing properties in 2010, resulting in fewer write downs compared to one year ago. In 2009, personnel expense decreased by $67 million from 2008. Excluding intangible assets impairment charges, nonpersonnel expense increased by $373 million, due primarily to a $167 million increase in the FDIC deposit insurance assessment, a $81 million increase in costs associated with OREO, a $46 million increase in business services and professional fees and a $67 million provision for losses on lending related commitments recorded during the current year, compared to a $26 million credit recorded for 2008. Additionally, nonpersonnel expense for 2009 was reduced by a $23 million credit (included in miscellaneous expense), representing the reversal of the remaining litigation reserve associated with the previously reported 53 Table of Contents Honsador litigation settled in September 2008. The increase in nonpersonnel expense, compared to 2009, was moderated by decreases of $29 million in operating lease expense and $15 million in marketing expense. More information about the intangible assets impairment charges is provided in this section under the heading Intangible assets impairment. Figure 15.

The following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest expense and the factors that caused those elements to change. Personnel As shown in Figure 16, personnel expense, the largest category of our noninterest expense, decreased by $43 million, or 3%, in 2010, following a $67 million, or 4%, decline in 2009 from 2008. The 2010 decrease was due largely to a $79 million decrease in our employee benefits expense. The employee benefits expense decrease was caused by a decline in pension expense as a result of amending our pension plans to freeze all benefit accruals and the resulting change in certain pension plan assumptions. For more information related to our pension plans, see Note 19 (Employee Benefits). Severance expense also decreased by $17 million. The decrease in personnel expense was partially offset by $44 million in increased incentive compensation accruals on improved profitability and an increase of $1 million in stock based compensation. The $8 million increase in salaries includes an $18 million decline in levels of deferred compensation (which has the effect of increasing salaries) and the impact of base salary increases, which are partially offset by lower levels of contract labor and the impact of a 7% decrease in the number of average full time equivalent employees from 2009. The 2009 decrease was due largely to a reduction in incentive compensation accruals and salaries expense. The $44 million decrease in salaries includes a $38 million decline in levels of deferred compensation (which has the effect of increasing salaries) and the impact of base salary increases, which are partially offset by lower levels of contract labor and the impact of an 8% decrease in the number of average full time equivalent employees. We also experienced a substantial increase in pension expense in 2009 attributed primarily to lower expected returns and an increase in the amortization of losses, resulting from the decrease in the value of pension plan assets following steep declines in the equity markets in 2008. 54 Table of Contents Figure 16.

Intangible assets impairment During the third quarter of 2009, we recorded a $45 million charge to write off intangible assets, other than goodwill, associated with actions taken to cease conducting business in certain equipment leasing markets. During the first quarter of 2009, we determined that the estimated fair value of our Key Corporate Bank reporting unit was less than the carrying amount, reflecting continued weakness in the financial markets. As a result, we recorded a pre tax noncash accounting charge of $223 million, of which $27 million related to the discontinued operations of Austin. As a result of this charge, we have now written off all of the goodwill that had been assigned to Key Corporate Bank. Operating lease expense The decrease in operating lease expense in both 2010 and 2009 is primarily attributable to product run off. Income related to the rental of leased equipment is presented in Figure 11 as operating lease income. FDIC Assessment FDIC assessment expense was unfavorably impacted in 2009 primarily by a one time special assessment recorded in the second quarter of 2009. This increase was partially offset by opting out of the TAG program effective July 1, 2010. OREO expense OREO expense decreased in 2010 primarily as a result of $7 million in net gain on sales recorded in 2010 compared to net loss on sales of $26 million in 2009. OREO expense increased $81 million in 2009 from 2008 due largely to valuation write downs totaling $60 million. Provision (credit) for losses on lending related commitments The provision for losses on lending related commitments fluctuated during the prior year as a result of variability in underlying credit quality and levels of unfunded commitments. Income taxes We recorded a tax provision from continuing operations of $186 million for 2010, compared to a tax benefit of $1.035 billion for 2009 and a provision of $437 million for 2008. The effective tax rate, which is the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes, was 23.4% for 2010, compared to 45.0% for 2009 and (51.4%) for 2008. Our federal tax (benefit) expense differs from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate, primarily because we generate income from investments in tax advantaged assets, such as corporate owned life insurance, earn credits associated with investments in low income housing projects and make periodic adjustments, to our tax reserves. During 2010, we recorded domestic deferred income tax expense of $32 million as the result of managements change in assertion as to indefinitely reinvesting in non US subsidiaries. Additionally, in 2009, we recorded a $106 million credit to income taxes, due primarily to the settlement of IRS audits for the tax years 1997 2006. The credit includes a final adjustment of $80 million related to the resolution of certain lease financing tax issues. In 2008, we recorded $586 million tax provision in connection with the leverage lease tax litigation, which became final in 2009. 55 Table of Contents Financial Condition Loans and loans held for sale Figure 17 shows the composition of our loan portfolio at December 31, for each of the past five years.

At December 31, 2010, total loans outstanding were $50.1 billion, compared to $58.8 billion at the end of 2009 and $72.8 billion at the end of 2008. Loans related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business, and excluded from total loans were $6.5 billion at December 31, 2010, $3.5 billion at December 31, 2009, and $3.7 billion at December 31, 2008. Further information regarding our discontinued operations is provided in the section entitled Consumer loan portfolio within this discussion. The decrease in our loans from continuing operations over the past two years reflects reductions in most of our portfolios, with the largest decline experienced in the commercial portfolio. Commercial loan portfolio Commercial loans outstanding were $34.5 billion at December 31, 2010, a decrease of $7.4 billion, or 18%, since December 31, 2009. This decrease was caused by continued soft demand for credit due to our clients use of the strength of the capital markets to raise debt and equity, pay downs on our portfolios and the run off in our exit loan portfolio as we continue to reduce our risk. We are beginning to see pockets of improvements in commercial lending as business is strengthening in certain regions. Commercial, financial and agricultural. As shown in Figure 17, our Commercial, Financial and Agricultural loans, also referred to as Commercial and Industrial, represent 33% of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2010 and 2009 and are the largest component of our total loans. The loans are comprised of fixed and variable rate loans to our large, middle market and small business clients. These loans decreased $2.8 billion or 15% from one year ago. Most of the decrease which occurred during the first half of 2010 was attributable to our clients using the capital markets to pay down their bank debt. In the latter half of 2010, our commercial, financial and agricultural portfolio began to stabilize. Commercial real estate loans. Commercial real estate loans represent approximately 23% of our total loan portfolio. These loans include both owner and nonowner occupied properties and constitute approximately 34% of our commercial loan portfolio. As shown in Figure 18, at December 31, 2010, our commercial real estate portfolio included mortgage loans of $9.5 billion and construction loans of $2.1 billion. The total commercial real estate loans for 2010 and 2009 represent 23% and 26%, respectively, of our total loans. Nonowner occupied loans represent 16% of our total loans and owner occupied loans represent 7% of our total loans. The average mortgage loan originated during 2010 was $2.9 million, and our largest mortgage loan at December 31, 2010, had a balance of $121 million. At December 31, 2010, our average construction loan commitment was $3.8 million. Our largest construction loan commitment was $49 million, $48.1 million of which was outstanding at December 31, 2010. Our commercial real estate lending business is conducted through two primary sources: our 14 state banking franchise, and Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services, a national line of business within Key Corporate Bank that cultivates relationships both within and beyond the branch system. This line of business deals primarily with nonowner occupied properties (generally properties for which at least 50% of the debt service is provided by rental income from nonaffiliated third parties) and accounted for approximately 60% of our average year to date commercial real estate loans during 2010, compared to 59% one year ago. Our commercial real estate business generally focuses on larger real estate developers and owners. As shown in Figure 18, this loan portfolio is diversified by both property type and geographic location of the underlying collateral. Figure 18 includes commercial mortgage and construction loans in both Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank. Figure 18.

This compares to an increase of $605 million during 2009, which was due to the deteriorating market conditions in both the income properties and residential properties segments of our commercial real estate construction portfolio. As previously reported, we have undertaken a process to reduce our exposure in the residential properties segment of our construction loan portfolio through the sale of certain loans. The secondary market for income property loans has been severely constrained for the past three years and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. In years prior to the economic downturn, we did not provide permanent financing for our clients upon the completion of their construction projects; permanent financing had been provided by the commercial mortgage backed securities market or other lenders. With other sources of permanent commercial mortgage financing constrained, we are currently providing interim financing for certain of our relationship clients when their commercial real estate construction projects are completed. During 2010 and 2009, we extended the maturities, for up to five years, of certain existing loans to commercial real estate relationship clients with projects at or near completion. We applied normal customary underwriting standards to these longer term extensions and generally received market rates of interest and additional fees, offering permanent market proxy fixed rates where appropriate, to mitigate the potential impact of rising interest rates. In cases where the terms were at less than normal market rates for similar lending arrangements, we have transferred these loans to the Asset Recovery Group for resolution. In 2010, there were $204 million of new restructured loans included in nonperforming loans, of which $67 million related to commercial real estate. As shown in Figure 18, at December 31, 2010, 68% of our commercial real estate loans were for nonowner occupied properties, compared to 71% at December 31, 2009. Approximately 23% and 40% of these loans were construction loans at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Typically, these properties are not fully leased at the origination of the loan. The borrower relies upon additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide the cash flow necessary to support debt service payments. Uncertain economic conditions generally slow the execution of new leases and may also lead to the turnover of existing leases, driving rental rates and occupancy rates down. As we have experienced during 2010, we expect vacancy rates for retail, office and industrial space to remain elevated and possibly increase well into 2011. Commercial real estate fundamentals appear to be approaching bottom, and certain sectors (i.e., apartments) are showing solid signs of improvement. According to Property and Portfolio Research, Inc., vacancy fell in the third quarter of 2010 in every major property type, but it remained above year ago levels with the exception of apartments. Rent growth remains flat to negative (again with the exception of apartments), and is at or nearing a trough; however, modest declines are possible over the next year in office, retail, and warehouse property types. Once rents bottom, the anticipated recovery will likely be modest. If the economic recovery stalls, and or job growth continues to disappoint, vacancies will remain elevated and downward pressure on rents and net operating income will remain. The resulting effect would likely be most noticeable in the nonowner occupied properties segment of our commercial real estate loan portfolio, particularly in the retail properties and office buildings components, which comprise 27% of our commercial real estate loans. Commercial property values peaked in the fall of 2007, having experienced increases of approximately 30% since 2005 and 90% since 2001. The most recent Moodys Real Estate Analytics, LLC Commercial Property Price Index (December 2010) shows a 42% drop in values from the peak, up 3.2% in the past year. As of October 2010, prices were up a modest 1.3% over the prior month, the second consecutive monthly gain. While overall prices may be reaching a bottom, market averages obscure divergent trends by asset quality and location. Competition for the best assets in the top markets is driving prices higher, while weak demand and continued uncertainty is keeping prices for distressed assets low and keeping trends negative. If the factors described above result in further weakening in the fundamentals underlying the commercial real estate market (i.e., vacancy rates, the stability of rental income and asset values), and lead to reduced cash flow to support debt service payments, our ability to collect such payments and the strength of our commercial real estate loan portfolio could be adversely affected. Commercial lease financing. We conduct financing arrangements through our Equipment Finance line of business and have both the scale and array of products to compete in the equipment lease financing business. Commercial lease financing receivables represented 19% of commercial loans at December 31, 2010, and 18% at December 31, 2009. As previously reported, we ceased conducting new business in both the commercial vehicle and office equipment leasing markets during the second half of 2009. 58 Table of Contents Commercial loan modification and restructuring Certain commercial loans are modified and extended in the normal course of business for our clients. Loan modifications vary and are handled on a case by case basis with strategies responsive to the specific circumstances of each loan and borrower. In many cases, borrowers have other resources and can reinforce the credit with additional capital, collateral, guarantees or income sources. Modifications are negotiated to achieve fair and mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan credit quality while at the same time meeting our clients financing needs. Modifications made to loans of creditworthy borrowers not experiencing financial difficulties and under circumstances where ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt are not classified as TDRs. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, TDR classification occurs when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a creditor concession has been granted. Our concession types are primarily categorized as interest rate reductions, principal deferral, or forgiveness of principal. Loan extensions are sometimes coupled with these primary concession types. The table below provides the amount of TDRs by the primary type of concession made at each period end. Since our volume of TDR activity is relatively new over the last five quarters, it is too early to gauge the success of the different types of concessions. Our success will be significantly influenced by economic conditions going forward. Although we have restructured these loans to provide the best opportunity for successful repayment by the borrowers, given the uncertainty of the current economic situation, we are not able to predict how these restructured notes will ultimately perform. Figure 19 shows our concession types for our commercial accruing and nonaccruing TDRs. Figure 19.

Right sizing the A note to sustainable cash flow should ultimately allow for its return to accrual status and thereupon a resumption of interest income recognition. Similarly, appropriately sized A notes will allow for upgraded credit classification based on rehabilitated credit metrics including demonstrated payment performance. Other benefits include the borrowers retention of ownership and control of the asset, deleveraged and sustainable capital structure (often sufficient to attract fresh capital into the transaction) and rehabilitation of local markets by minimizing distressed/fire sales. As the objective of the multiple notes TDR is to achieve a fully performing and well rated A note, we focus on sizing the A note to a level that is supported by cash flow available to service debt at current market terms and consistent with our customary underwriting standards. This typically will include a debt coverage ratio of 1.2 or better of cash flow to monthly payments of market interest and principal amortization of generally not more than 25 years. The B note is typically an interest only note with no required amortization until the property stabilizes and generates excess cash flow which is customarily applied directly to principal. The B note is subsequently evaluated at such time when accrual restoration of the A note is under consideration. In many cases, the B note has then been charged off contemporaneously with the A note being returned to accrual status. Alternatively, both A and B notes may be simultaneously returned to accrual if credit metrics are supportive as set forth above. In many cases where a three (A, B, C) note structure has been utilized, the C notes are fully charged off at the time of the TDR. In the very few instances where the C note is not charged off, there is a pending equity event, additional leasing or pending sale of developed units that support the C note balance shortly after the TDR. All loans processed as a TDR, including A notes and any non charged off B or C notes, are reported as TDRs during the year in which they are consummated. Returning an A note to accrual status requires a reasonable level of certainty that the balance of principal and interest is fully collectable over time. Our policy requires a sustained period of timely principal and interest payments to restore a loan to accrual status. Primary repayment derived from property cash flow is evaluated for risk of continued sustainability while secondary repayment (collateral) is appraised to ensure that market value exceeds the carrying value of the A note with a sufficient excess (generally 20%). Although our policy is a guideline, considerable judgment is required to review each borrowers circumstances. Extensions Certain commercial loans are modified and extended in the normal course of business for our clients. Project loans are typically refinanced into the permanent commercial loan market at maturity; however, due to the limited sources of permanent commercial mortgage financing available in the market today and the market wide decline in leasing activity and rental rates, an increased number of loans have been extended. Extension terms take into account the specific circumstances of the client relationship, the status of the project and near term prospects for both the client and the collateral. In all cases, pricing and loan structure are reviewed and (where necessary) modified to ensure the loan has been priced to achieve a market rate of return and loan terms (i.e., amortization, covenants and term) that are appropriate for the risk. Typical enhancements include one or more of the following: principal paydown, increased amortization, additional collateral, increased guarantees, and or a cash flow sweep. As previously mentioned, some maturing construction loans have automatic extension options built in and in those cases where the borrower qualifies for the extension option, pricing and loan terms cannot be altered. Most project loans by their nature are collateral dependent as cash flow from the project loans or the sale of the real estate provides for repayment of the loan. Pricing of a loan is determined based on the strength of the borrowing entity and the strength of the guarantor if any. Therefore, pricing may remain the same (e.g., the loan is already priced at or above current market). We do not consider loan extensions in the normal course of business (under existing loan terms or at market rates) as TDRs, particularly when ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt and no concession has been made. In the case of loan extensions outside of the normal course of business where either collection of all principal and interest is uncertain or a concession has been made, we would analyze such credit under the accounting guidance to determine whether it qualifies as a TDR. Extensions that qualify as TDRs are measured for impairment under the applicable accounting guidance. Guarantors A detailed guarantor analysis is conducted (1) for all new extensions of credit, (2) at the time of any material modification/extension, and (3) typically annually, as part of our on going portfolio and loan monitoring procedures. This analysis includes submission by the guarantor entity of all appropriate financial statements including balance sheets, income statements, tax returns, and real estate schedules. While the specific steps of each guarantor analysis may have some minor differences, the high level objectives include reaching a conclusion regarding the overall financial conditions of the guarantor entities, including: size, quality, and nature of asset base; 60 Table of Contents net worth (adjusted to reflect our opinion of market value); leverage; standing liquidity; recurring cash flow; contingent and direct debt obligations; and near term debt maturities. Borrower and guarantor financial statements are required at least annually within 90 120 days of the calendar/fiscal year end. Income statements and rent rolls for project collateral are required quarterly. In some cases, disclosure of certain information including liquidity, certifications, status of asset sales or debt resolutions, and real estate schedules may be required more frequently. We routinely seek performance from guarantors of impaired debt, if the guarantor is solvent. In limited circumstances, we would not seek to enforce the guaranty, including situations in which we are precluded by bankruptcy and or it is determined the cost to pursue a guarantor exceeds the value to be returned given the guarantors verified financial condition. We are often successful in obtaining either monetary payment and or the cooperation of our solvent guarantors to help mitigate loss, cost and the expense of collections. As of December 31, 2010, we had $507 million of mortgage and construction loans that had a loan to value ratio greater than 1.0 and were accounted for as performing loans. These loans were not considered impaired due to one or more of the following factors: underlying cash flow adequate to service the debt at a market rate of return with adequate amortization; a satisfactory borrower payment history; and acceptable guarantor support. Consumer loan portfolio Consumer loans outstanding decreased by $1.3 billion, or 8%, from one year ago. As shown in Figure 41 in the Credit risk management section, the majority of the reduction came from our exit loan portfolio. Most of the decrease is attributable to the marine segment. The home equity portfolio is the largest segment of our consumer loan portfolio. Virtually all of this portfolio (93% at December 31, 2010) is derived primarily from the Regional Banking line of business within our Key Community Bank. The remainder of the portfolio, which has been in an exit mode since the fourth quarter of 2007, was originated from the Consumer Finance line of business and is now included in Other Segments. Home equity loans within Key Community Bank decreased by $534 million, or 5%, over the past twelve months. Figure 21 summarizes our home equity loan portfolio by source at the end of each of the last five years, as well as certain asset quality statistics and yields on the portfolio as a whole. Figure 21.

As previously reported, we have experienced a decrease in our consumer loan portfolio. We expect the portfolio continue to decrease in future periods as a result of our actions to exit dealer originated home equity loans and indirect retail lending for marine and recreational vehicle products, and discontinue the education lending business. We ceased originating new education loans effective December 5, 2009 and account for this business in discontinued operations. In the latter half of 2010, there has been public controversy surrounding the foreclosure practices of large home lenders. Our number of home loan foreclosures is small (the average number of new mortgage foreclosures serviced by Key and third parties, initiated per month, through December 31, 2010 is 140, compared to approximately 238,000 such mortgage loans) and primarily have occurred in our home equity loan portfolio. A review of our foreclosure processes (which is still ongoing) has not uncovered any material defects in the process of signing and notarizing affidavits. 61 Table of Contents Loans held for sale As shown in Note 4 (Loans and Loans Held for Sale), our loans held for sale increased to $467 million at December 31, 2010 from $443 million at December 31, 2009. Loans held for sale related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business, which are excluded from total loans held for sale at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, totaled $15 million and $434 million, respectively. At December 31, 2010, loans held for sale included $118 million of commercial mortgages which decreased by $53 million from December 31, 2009, and $110 million of residential mortgage loans which decreased by $29 million from December 31, 2009. In the absence of quoted market prices, we use valuation models to measure the fair value of these loans and adjust the amount recorded on the balance sheet if fair value falls below recorded cost. The models are based on third party data, as well as assumptions related to prepayment speeds, default rates, funding cost, discount rates and other relevant market available inputs. In light of the volatility in the financial markets, we have reviewed our assumptions and determined that they reflect current market conditions. As a result, no significant adjustments to our assumptions were required during 2010. During 2010, we recorded net unrealized losses of $10 million and net realized gains of $44 million on our loans held for sale portfolio. These net gains are reported in net gains (losses) from loan sales on the income statement. We have not been significantly impacted by market volatility in the subprime mortgage lending industry, having exited this business in the fourth quarter of 2006. Loan sales As shown in Figure 22, during 2010, we sold $1.2 billion of commercial real estate loans, $1.6 billion of residential real estate loans, $370 million of commercial loans and $64 million of commercial lease financing. Most of these sales came from the held for sale portfolio. Additionally, we sold $487 million of education loans (included in discontinued assets on the balance sheet), which are excluded from Figure 22. Due to unfavorable market conditions, we have not securitized any education loans since 2006. Among the factors that we consider in determining which loans to sell are: whether particular lending businesses meet established performance standards or fit with our relationship banking strategy; our A/LM needs; the cost of alternative funding sources; the level of credit risk; capital requirements; and market conditions and pricing. Figure 22 summarizes our loan sales for 2010 and 2009. Figure 22.

The table includes loans that have been sold. Figure 23.

(b) We adopted new accounting guidance on January 1, 2010, which required us to consolidate our education loan securitization trusts and resulted in the addition of approximately $2.8 billion of assets, liabilities and equity to our balance sheet. Of this amount, $890 million were included in our net risk weighted assets under current federal banking regulations. (c) In November 2006, we sold the $2.5 billion subprime mortgage loan portfolio held by the Champion Mortgage finance business but continued to provide servicing through various dates in March 2007. In the event of default by a borrower, we are subject to recourse with respect to approximately $736 million of the $118 billion of loans administered or serviced at December 31, 2010. Additional information about this recourse arrangement is included in Note 16 (Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees) under the heading Recourse agreement with FNMA. We derive income from several sources when retaining the right to administer or service loans that are sold. We earn noninterest income (recorded as other income) from fees for servicing or administering loans. This fee income is reduced by the amortization of related servicing assets. In addition, we earn interest income from investing funds generated by escrow deposits collected in connection with the servicing of commercial real estate loans. Additional information about our mortgage servicing assets is included in Note 9 (Mortgage Servicing Assets). Maturities and sensitivity of certain loans to changes in interest rates Figure 24 shows the remaining maturities of certain commercial and real estate loans, and the sensitivity of those loans to changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2010, approximately 38% of these outstanding loans were scheduled to mature within one year. Figure 24.

(b) Predetermined interest rates either are fixed or may change during the term of the loan according to a specific formula or schedule. Securities Our securities portfolio totaled $22.0 billion at December 31, 2010, compared to $16.7 billion at December 31, 2009. At each of these dates, most of our securities consisted of securities available for sale, with the remainder consisting of held to maturity securities of less than $25 million. 63 Table of Contents Securities available for sale The majority of our securities available for sale portfolio consists of CMOs, which are debt securities secured by a pool of mortgages or mortgage backed securities. CMOs generate interest income and serve as collateral to support certain pledging agreements. At December 31, 2010, we had $21.7 billion invested in CMOs and other mortgage backed securities in the available for sale portfolio, compared to $16.4 billion at December 31, 2009. As shown in Figure 25, all of our mortgage backed securities are issued by government sponsored enterprises or GNMA and are traded in highly liquid secondary markets and recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. We employ an outside bond pricing service to determine the fair value at which these securities should be recorded on the balance sheet. In performing the valuations, the pricing service relies on models that consider security specific details, as well as relevant industry and economic factors. The most significant of these inputs are quoted market prices, interest rate spreads on relevant benchmark securities and certain prepayment assumptions. We review valuations derived from the models to ensure they are consistent with the values placed on similar securities traded in the secondary markets. Figure 25. Mortgage Backed Securities by Issuer December 31, in millions 2010 2009 2008 FHLMC $ 10,373 $ 7,485 $ 4,719 FNMA 7,357 4,433 3,002 GNMA 4,004 4,516 369 Total $ 21,734 $ 16,434 $ 8,090 During 2010, we had net gains of $203 million from CMOs and other mortgage backed securities, all of which were unrealized. The net unrealized gains resulted from a decrease in market interest rates and were recorded in the AOCI component of shareholders equity. We continue to maintain a moderate asset sensitive exposure to near term changes in interest rates. We periodically evaluate our securities available for sale portfolio in light of established A/LM objectives, changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio, and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed. These evaluations may cause us to take steps to adjust our overall balance sheet positioning. In addition, the size and composition of our securities available for sale portfolio could vary with our needs for liquidity and the extent to which we are required (or elect) to hold these assets as collateral to secure public funds and trust deposits. Although we generally use debt securities for this purpose, other assets, such as securities purchased under resale agreements or letters of credit, are used occasionally when they provide a lower cost of collateral or more favorable risk profiles. During 2010, our investing activities continue to complement other balance sheet developments and provide for our ongoing liquidity management needs. We purchased $9.8 billion in CMOs, and had maturities and cash flows of $4.7 billion. The purchases were in CMOs issued by government sponsored entities or GNMA. We are able to either pledge these securities to the Federal Reserve or Federal Home Loan Bank for secured borrowing arrangements, sell them or use them in connection with repurchase agreements should alternate sources of liquidity be required in the future. Figure 26 shows the composition, yields and remaining maturities of our securities available for sale.

Other investments Principal investments investments in equity and mezzanine instruments made by our Principal Investing unit represented 66% of other investments at December 31, 2010. They include direct investments (investments made in a particular company) as well as indirect investments (investments made through funds that include other investors). Principal investments are predominantly made in privately held companies and are carried at fair value ($898 million at December 31, 2010 and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2009). In addition to principal investments, other investments include other equity and mezzanine instruments, such as certain real estate related investments that are carried at fair value, as well as other types of investments that generally are carried at cost. Most of our other investments are not traded on an active market. We determine the fair value at which these investments should be recorded based on the nature of the specific investment and all available relevant information. Among other things, our review may encompass such factors as the issuers past financial performance and future potential, the values of public companies in comparable businesses, the risks associated with the particular business or investment type, current market 65 Table of Contents conditions, the nature and duration of resale restrictions, the issuers payment history, our knowledge of the industry and third party data. During 2010, net gains from our principal investing activities (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests) totaled $66 million, which includes $59 million of net unrealized gains. These net gains are recorded as net gains (losses) from principal investing on the income statement. Deposits and other sources of funds Domestic deposits are our primary source of funding. During 2010, these deposits averaged $62.5 billion and represented 80% of the funds we used to support loans and other earning assets, compared to $66.2 billion and 78% during 2009. The composition of our average deposits is shown in Figure 9 in the section entitled Net interest income. The decrease in average domestic deposits compared to 2009 was due to a decline in certificates of deposit ($100,000 or more) and other time deposits. This decline was offset by an increase in NOW and money market deposit accounts, and noninterest bearing deposits. The mix of deposits continues to change as higher costing certificates of deposit mature and reprice to current market rates and clients move their balances to transaction and nonmaturity deposit accounts, such as NOW and money market savings accounts, or look for other alternatives for investing in the current low rate environment. Wholesale funds, consisting of deposits in our foreign office and short term borrowings, averaged $3.5 billion during 2010, compared to $4.3 billion during 2009. The change resulted from a $124 million increase in foreign office deposits and a $426 million increase in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, which was offset partially by a $1.4 billion decline in bank notes and other short term borrowings. Substantially all of our domestic deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. Accordingly, we are subject to deposit insurance premium assessments by the FDIC. On November 17, 2009, the FDIC published a final rule to announce an amended DIF restoration plan requiring depository institutions, such as KeyBank, to prepay, on December 30, 2009, their estimated quarterly risk based assessments for the third and fourth quarters of 2009 and for all of 2010, 2011 and 2012. On that date, KeyBank paid the FDIC $539 million to cover the insurance assessments for those time periods. For 2010, our FDIC insurance assessment was $124 million. At the end of the year, we had $388 million of prepaid FDIC insurance assessments recorded on our balance sheet. On February 7, 2011, the FDIC adopted their final rule on assessments. Under the final rule, which is effective on April 1, 2011, KeyBanks annualized deposit insurance premium assessments would range from $.025 to $.45 for each $100 of its new assessment base, depending on its new scorecard performance incorporating KeyBanks regulatory rating, ability to withstand asset and funding related stress, and relative magnitude of potential losses to the FDIC in the event of KeyBanks failure. We estimate that our 2011 expense for deposit insurance assessments will be $60 to $90 million. At December 31, 2010, Key had $6.8 billion in time deposits of $100,000 or more. Figure 28 shows the maturity distribution of these deposits. Figure 28.

The following discusses certain factors that contributed to the change in our shareholders equity. For other factors that contributed to the change, see the section entitled Statement of Changes in Equity. Adoption of new accounting guidance Effective January 1, 2010, we adopted new consolidation accounting guidance that required us to consolidate our education loan securitization trusts (classified as discontinued assets and liabilities), thereby adding $2.8 billion in assets, liabilities and equity to our balance sheet. As a result of adopting this new guidance, we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment (after tax) of $45 million to beginning retained earnings on January 1, 2010. 66 Table of Contents Dividends During 2010, we made dividend payments of $125 million to the U.S. Treasury on our Series B Preferred Stock as a participant in the U.S. Treasurys CPP. Also, we made four quarterly dividend payments of $1.9375 per share or $6 million per quarter, on our Series A Preferred Stock. Additionally, during 2010, we made four quarterly dividend payments of $.01 per share, or $9 million per quarter, on our Common Shares. Common Shares outstanding Our Common Shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol KEY. At December 31, 2010, our book value per Common Share was $9.52 based on 880.3 million shares outstanding at December 31, 2010, compared to $9.04 based on 878.5 million shares outstanding at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2010 our tangible book value per Common Share was $8.45 compared to $7.94 at December 31, 2009. Figure 46 in the section entitled Fourth Quarter Results shows the market price ranges of our Common Shares, per Common Share earnings and dividends paid by quarter for each of the last two years. Figure 29 compares the price performance of our Common Shares (based on an initial investment of $100 on December 31, 2004, and assuming reinvestment of dividends) with that of the Standard Poors 500 Index and a group of other banks that constitute our peer group. The peer group consists of the banks that make up the Standard Poors 500 Regional Bank Index and the banks that make up the Standard Poors 500 Diversified Bank Index. We are included in the Standard Poors 500 Index and the peer group. Figure 29.

During 2010, shares previously issued in conjunction with our employee benefit plans were returned to us. Going forward we expect to reissue treasury shares as needed in connection with stock based compensation awards and for other corporate purposes. We repurchase Common Shares periodically in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions under a repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors. The program does not have an expiration date, and we have outstanding Board authority to repurchase 13.9 million shares. We did not repurchase any Common Shares during 2010 or 2009. Further, in accordance with the terms of our participation in the CPP, until the earlier of three years after the issuance of, or such time as the U.S. Treasury no longer holds, any Series B Preferred Stock issued by us under that program, we will not be able to repurchase any of our Common Shares without the approval of the U.S. Treasury, subject to certain limited exceptions (e.g., for purchases in connection with benefit plans). Capital availability and management As a result of market disruptions in previous periods, we closely monitor the availability of capital which had been severely restricted for financial services companies to different degrees since August 2007. While we have been successful in raising additional capital, lower market prices per share have increased the dilution of our per Common Share results. While the capital markets have recently been more favorable, we cannot predict whether those more favorable market conditions will continue. We determine how capital is to be strategically allocated among our businesses to maximize returns within acceptable risk parameters and strengthen core relationship businesses. In that regard, we will continue to emphasize our client relationship strategy. Capital adequacy Capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance. All of our capital ratios remain strong at December 31, 2010. Our strong capital and improved liquidity position us to adjust to the application of any new regulatory capital standards due to or promulgated under the Dodd Frank Act. Our shareholders equity to assets ratio was 12.10% at December 31, 2010, compared to 11.43% at December 31, 2009. Our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 8.19% at December 31, 2010, compared to 7.56% at December 31, 2009. Banking industry regulators prescribe minimum capital ratios for bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries. Risk based capital guidelines require a minimum level of capital as a percent of risk weighted assets. Risk weighted assets consist of total assets plus certain off balance sheet and market items, subject to adjustment for predefined credit risk factors. Currently, banks and bank holding companies must maintain, at a minimum, Tier 1 capital as a percent of risk weighted assets of 4.00% and total capital as a percent of risk weighted assets of 8.00%. As of December 31, 2010, our Tier 1 risk based capital ratio increased 241 basis points from 2009 to 15.16%, and our total risk based capital ratio increased 217 basis points from 2009 to 19.12%. Another indicator of capital adequacy, the leverage ratio, is defined as Tier 1 capital as a percentage of average quarterly tangible assets. Leverage ratio requirements vary with the condition of the financial institution. BHCs that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the Federal Reserves risk adjusted measure for market risk as we have must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 3.00%. All other BHCs must maintain a minimum ratio of 4.00%. As of December 31, 2010, our leverage ratio increased by 130 basis points from 2009 to 13.02%. The enactment of the Dodd Frank Act changes the regulatory capital standards that apply to bank holding companies by requiring regulators to create rules phasing out the treatment of capital securities and cumulative preferred securities (excluding CPP preferred stock issued to the United States or any federal government entity before October 4, 2010) being eligible Tier 1 risk based capital. This three year phase out period, which commences January 1, 2013, will ultimately result in our capital securities being treated only as Tier 2 capital. These changes in effect apply the same leverage and risk based capital requirements that apply to depository institutions to BHCs, savings and loan holding companies, and nonbank financial companies identified as systemically important. As of December 31, 2010, our Tier 1 risk based capital ratio, leverage ratio, and total risk based capital ratio represented 15.16%, 13.02%, and 19.12%, respectively. The trust preferred securities issued by the KeyCorp and Union State Bank capital trusts contribute $1.8 billion or 229, 196, and 229 basis points to our Tier 1 risk based capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, and total risk based capital ratio, respectively, as of December 31, 2010. Under the FDIA prompt corrective action standards, Federal bank regulators group FDIC insured depository institutions into five categories, ranging from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized. A well capitalized institution must meet or exceed the prescribed thresholds of 6.00% for Tier 1 risk based capital, 5.00% for Tier 1 leverage capital, 10.00% for total risk based 68 Table of Contents capital and must not be subject to any written agreement, order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. If these provisions applied to bank holding companies, we would qualify as well capitalized at December 31, 2010. We believe there has not been any change in condition or event since that date that would cause our capital classification to change. Analysis on a pro forma basis, accounting for the phase out of our trust preferred securities as Tier 1 eligible (and therefore as Tier 2 instead) as of December 31, 2010, also determines that we would qualify as well capitalized under current regulatory guidelines, with the pro forma Tier 1 risk based capital ratio, pro forma leverage ratio, and pro forma total capital ratio being 12.84%, 10.98%, and 19.09%, respectively. The current regulatory defined categories serve a limited supervisory function. Investors should not use our pro forma ratios as a representation of our overall financial condition or prospects of KeyCorp or KeyBank. Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company capital adequacy based on both the amount and composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. As a result of the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has intensified its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of Tier 1 risk based capital, known as Tier 1 common equity, and its review of the consolidated capitalization of systemically important financial companies, including KeyCorp. Because the Federal Reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders equity (essentially Tier 1 risk based capital less preferred stock, qualifying capital securities and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries) generally should be the dominant element in Tier 1 risk based capital, such a focus is consistent with existing capital adequacy guidelines and does not imply a new or ongoing capital standard. The modifications mandated by the Dodd Frank Act are consistent with the renewed focus on Tier 1 common equity and the consolidated capitalization of banks, BHCs, and covered nonbank financial companies, which resulted from the financial crisis. Because Tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by GAAP nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations, this measure is considered to be a non GAAP financial measure. Figure 5 in the Highlights of Our 2010 Performance section reconciles Key shareholders equity, the GAAP performance measure, to Tier 1 common equity, the corresponding non GAAP measure. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio was 9.34% at December 31, 2010, compared to 7.50% at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2010, we had a consolidated net deferred tax asset of $442 million compared to $569 million at December 31, 2009. In prior years, we had been in a net deferred tax liability position. Generally, for risk based capital purposes, deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income are limited to the lesser of: (i) the amount of deferred tax assets that a financial institution expects to realize within one year of the calendar quarter end date, based on its projected future taxable income for the year, or (ii) 10% of the amount of an institutions Tier 1 capital. Based on these restrictions, at December 31, 2010, $158 million of our net deferred tax assets were deducted from Tier 1 capital and risk weighted assets compared to $514 million at December 31, 2009. We anticipate that the amount of our net deferred tax asset disallowed for risk based capital purposes will decline in coming quarters. Basel III On December 15, 2010, the Basel Committee released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation, now officially identified as Basel III. As discussed more fully in this reports Supervision and Regulation section beginning on page 5, Basel III requires higher and better quality capital, better risk coverage, the introduction of a leverage ratio as a backstop to the risk based requirement, measures to promote the build up of capital that can be drawn down in periods of stress, the use of contingent capital to provide an additional level of protection for depositors and creditors, and the introduction of two global liquidity standards. Basel III introduces for the first time an official definition and specific guideline minimums for Tier 1 common equity. When the requirements for the capital conservation buffer are included, the resulting minimum levels for Tier 1 capital and total risk based capital will be higher than the U.S.s current well capitalized minimums. We have prepared pro forma estimates of our capital ratios using the Basel III capital guidelines. These estimates indicate that our capital levels are currently above the Basel III minimums, including the capital conservation buffer and the phasing out of trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital pursuant to the Dodd Frank Act. The U.S. banking regulatory agencies have not yet set forth a formal timeline for a notice of proposed rulemaking or final adoption of regulations responsive to Basel III. The Basel III final capital framework provides for implementation to commence January 1, 2013. In light of Basel IIIs timeline and U.S. regulators support for Basel III, a notice of proposed rulemaking likely will be issued in mid 2011. 69 Table of Contents Figure 31 represents the details of our regulatory capital position at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009.

(b) Other assets deducted from Tier 1 capital and risk weighted assets consist of disallowed deferred tax assets of $158 million at December 31, 2010 and $514 million at December 31, 2009, disallowed intangible assets (excluding goodwill) and deductible portions of nonfinancial equity investments. (c) The allowance for loan and lease losses included in Tier 2 capital is limited by regulation to 1.25% of the sum of gross risk weighted assets plus low level exposures and residual interests calculated under the direct reduction method, as defined by the Federal Reserve. The excess allowance for loan and lease losses includes $114 million and $157 million at December 31, 2010, and December 31, 2009, respectively, of allowance classified as discontinued assets on the balance sheet. (d) This ratio is Tier 1 capital divided by average quarterly total assets as defined by the Federal Reserve less: (i) goodwill, (ii) the disallowed intangible assets described in footnote (b), and (iii) deductible portions of nonfinancial equity investments; plus assets derecognized as an offset to AOCI resulting from the adoption and subsequent application of the applicable accounting guidance for defined benefit and other postretirement plans. The Dodd Frank Acts Reform of Deposit Insurance The Dodd Frank Act makes permanent the current FDIC deposit insurance limit of $250,000 and provides for temporary unlimited FDIC deposit insurance until January 1, 2013 for non interest bearing demand transaction accounts at all insured 70 Table of Contents depository institutions effective December 31, 2010 (concurrent with the expiration date of the current TAG program extension). Accordingly, effective December 31, 2010, KeyBank will again offer noninterest bearing demand transaction accounts, with unlimited FDIC deposit insurance, similar to when it participated in the TLGP. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations Off balance sheet arrangements We are party to various types of off balance sheet arrangements, which could lead to contingent liabilities or risks of loss that are not reflected on the balance sheet. Variable interest entities A VIE is a partnership, limited liability company, trust or other legal entity that meets any one of the following criteria: The entity does not have sufficient equity to conduct its activities without additional subordinated financial support from another party. The entitys investors lack the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance. The entitys equity at risk holders do not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive residual returns. The voting rights of some investors are not proportional to their economic interests in the entity, and substantially all of the entitys activities involve, or are conducted on behalf of, investors with disproportionately few voting rights. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for consolidations, we also consolidate a VIE if we have: (i) a variable interest in the entity; (ii) the power to direct activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance; and (iii) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE (i.e., we are considered to be the primary beneficiary). Additional information regarding the nature of VIEs and our involvement with them is included in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) under the heading Basis of Presentation and Note 11 (Variable Interest Entities). We use the equity method to account for unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or VIEs if we have significant influence over the entitys operating and financing decisions (usually defined as a voting or economic interest of 20% to 50%, but not controlling). Unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or VIEs in which we have a voting or economic interest of less than 20% generally are carried at cost. Investments held by our registered broker dealer and investment company subsidiaries (primarily principal investments) are carried at fair value. Commitments to extend credit or funding Loan commitments provide for financing on predetermined terms as long as the client continues to meet specified criteria. These commitments generally carry variable rates of interest and have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. We typically charge a fee for our loan commitments. Since a commitment may expire without resulting in a loan or being fully utilized, the total amount of an outstanding commitment may significantly exceed any related cash outlay. Further information about our loan commitments at December 31, 2010, is presented in Note 16 (Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees) under the heading Commitments to Extend Credit or Funding. Figure 32 shows the remaining contractual amount of each class of commitment to extend credit or funding. For loan commitments and commercial letters of credit, this amount represents our maximum possible accounting loss if the borrower were to draw upon the full amount of the commitment and then default on payment for the total amount of the then outstanding loan. Other off balance sheet arrangements Other off balance sheet arrangements include financial instruments that do not meet the definition of a guarantee in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, and other relationships, such as liquidity support provided to asset backed commercial paper conduits, indemnification agreements and intercompany guarantees. Information about such arrangements is provided in Note 16 under the heading Other Off Balance Sheet Risk. 71 Table of Contents Contractual obligations Figure 32 summarizes our significant contractual obligations, and lending related and other off balance sheet commitments at December 31, 2010, by the specific time periods in which related payments are due or commitments expire.

Guarantees We are a guarantor in various agreements with third parties. As guarantor, we may be contingently liable to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in a specified interest rate, foreign exchange rate or other variable (including the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a specified event). These variables, known as underlyings, may be related to an asset or liability, or another entitys failure to perform under a contract. Additional information regarding these types of arrangements is presented in Note 16 under the heading Guarantees. Risk Management Overview Like all financial services companies, we engage in business activities and assume the related risks. The most significant risks we face are credit, liquidity, market, compliance, operational, strategic and reputation risks. We must properly and effectively 72 Table of Contents identify, assess, measure, monitor, control and report such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability. Certain of these risks are defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this section. During 2010, our management team continued to enhance our ERM Program. Our ERM Committee, which consists of the Chief Executive Officer and other Senior Executives, is responsible for managing risk and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite. The ERM Program encompasses our risk philosophy, policy, framework and governance structure for the management of risks across the entire company. The ERM Committee reports to the Risk Management Committee of our Board of Directors. Annually, the Board of Directors reviews and approves the ERM Program, as well as the risk appetite and corporate risk tolerances for major risk categories. We continue to enhance our ERM Program and related practices and to use a risk adjusted capital framework to manage risks. This framework is approved and managed by the ERM Committee. Our Board of Directors serves in an oversight capacity with the objective of managing our enterprise wide risks in a manner that is effective, balanced and adds value for the shareholders. The Board inquires about risk practices, reviews the portfolio of risks, compares actual risks to the risk appetite and tolerances, and receives regular reports about significant risks both actual and emerging. To assist in these efforts, the Board has delegated primary oversight responsibility for risk to the Audit Committee and the Risk Management Committee. The Audit Committee has oversight responsibility for internal audit; financial reporting; compliance risk and legal matters; the implementation, management and evaluation of operational risk and controls; information security and fraud risk; and evaluating the qualifications and independence of the independent auditors. The Audit Committee discusses policies related to risk assessment and risk management and the processes related to risk review and compliance. The Risk Management Committee has responsibility for overseeing the management of credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk (including the actions taken to mitigate these risks), as well as reputational and strategic risks relating to the foregoing. The Risk Management Committee also oversees the maintenance of appropriate regulatory and economic capital. The Risk Management Committee reviews the ERM reports and, in conjunction with the Audit Committee, reviews reports of material changes to the Operational Risk Committee and Compliance Risk Committee charters, and approves any material changes to the charter of the ERM Committee. The Audit and Risk Management Committees meet jointly, as appropriate, to discuss matters that relate to each committees responsibilities. In addition to regularly scheduled bi monthly meetings, the Audit Committee convenes to discuss the content of our financial disclosures and quarterly earnings releases. Committee chairpersons routinely meet with management during interim months to plan agendas for upcoming meetings and to discuss emerging trends and events that have transpired since the preceding meeting. All members of the Board receive formal reports designed to keep them abreast of significant developments during the interim months. Federal banking regulators are reemphasizing with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution. We believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks, and comport with regulatory expectations. Market risk management The values of financial instruments change as a function of changes in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity values, commodity prices and other market factors that influence prospective market rates or prices. For example, the value of a fixed rate bond will decline if market interest rates increase. Similarly, the value of the U.S. dollar regularly fluctuates in relation to other currencies. The holder of a financial instrument faces market risk when the value of the instrument is tied to such external factors. Most of our market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations. Interest rate risk management Interest rate risk, which is inherent in the banking industry, is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the economic value of equity. Such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates, and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. We manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the economic value of equity in accordance with our risk appetite, and within policy limits established by the ERM Committee. Interest rate risk positions can be influenced by a number of factors other than changes in market interest rates, including economic conditions, the competitive environment within our markets, and balance sheet positioning that arises out of consumer preferences for specific loan and deposit products. The primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of basis risk, gap risk, yield curve risk and option risk. 73 Table of Contents We face basis risk when floating rate assets and floating rate liabilities reprice at the same time, but in response to different market factors or indices. Under those circumstances, even if equal amounts of assets and liabilities are repricing, interest expense and interest income may not change by the same amount. Gap risk occurs if interest bearing liabilities and the interest earning assets they fund (for example, deposits used to fund loans) do not mature or reprice at the same time. Yield curve risk is the exposure to non parallel changes in the slope of the yield curve (where the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity) if interest bearing liabilities and the interest earning assets they fund do not price or reprice to the same term point on the yield curve. For example, if medium term interest rates decline, the rates on three to five year automobile loans also will decline, but the cost of one to two year certificates of deposit may not change. A financial instrument presents option risk when one party to the instrument can take advantage of changes in interest rates without penalty. For example, when interest rates decline, borrowers may choose to prepay fixed rate loans and refinance at a lower rate. Such a prepayment gives us a return on our investment (the principal plus some interest), but unless there is a prepayment penalty, that return may not be as high as the return that would have been generated had payments been received over the original term of the loan. Deposits that can be withdrawn on demand also present option risk. Net interest income simulation analysis. The primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis. For purposes of this analysis, we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on and off balance sheet positions and the current and projected interest rate environments. The simulation assumes that projections of our on and off balance sheet positions will reflect recent product trends, targets and plans established by the ALCO Committee and the lines of business, and consensus economic forecasts. Typically, the amount of net interest income at risk is measured by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if the federal funds target rate were to gradually increase or decrease by 200 basis points over the next twelve months, and term rates were to move in a similar fashion. In light of the low interest rate environment, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, we modified the standard rate scenario of a gradual decrease of 200 basis points over twelve months to a gradual decrease of 25 basis points over two months with no change over the following ten months. After calculating the amount of net interest income at risk to interest rate changes, we compare that amount with the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment. The analysis also considers sensitivity to changes in a number of other variables, including other market interest rates and the mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. We also perform regular stress tests and sensitivities on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments. One set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of interest rate inputs on simulated exposures. Assessments are performed using different shapes in the yield curve (the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity), including a sustained flat yield curve, an inverted slope yield curve, changes in credit spreads, an immediate parallel change in market interest rates and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates. Another set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of loan and deposit assumptions and assumed discretionary strategies on simulated exposures. Assessments are performed on changes to the following assumptions: the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities, changes in lending spreads, prepayments on loans and securities, other loan and deposit balance changes, investment, funding and hedging activities, and liquidity and capital management strategies. Simulation analysis produces only a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on judgments related to assumption inputs into the simulation model. Actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the following inputs: balance sheet composition, customer behavior, product pricing, market interest rates, realized investment, hedging and funding activities. Actual results may also differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to repercussions from anticipated or unknown events. We tailor assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled, and validate those assumptions on a regular basis. Our simulations are performed with the assumption that interest rate risk positions will be actively managed through the use of on and off balance sheet financial instruments to achieve the desired residual risk profile. Figure 33 presents the results of the simulation analysis at December 31, 2010 and 2009. At December 31, 2010, our simulated exposure to a change in short term interest rates was moderately asset sensitive. ALCO policy limits for risk management call for the identification of actions that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual increase or decrease in short term interest rates over the next twelve months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 4%. As shown in Figure 33, we are operating within these limits. 74 Table of Contents Figure 33. Simulated Change in Net Interest Income December 31, 2010 Basis point change assumption (short term rates) 25 200 ALCO policy limits 4.00 % 4.00 % Interest rate risk assessment .74 % 2.99 % December 31, 2009 Basis point change assumption (short term rates) 25 +200 ALCO policy limits 4.00 % 4.00 % Interest rate risk assessment .85 % +3.55 % As interest rates have remained at low levels for an extended period of time, we have gradually shifted from a liability sensitive position to an asset sensitive position as a result of balance growth in transaction deposits and declines in loan balances. Although outstanding derivative hedge positions have declined over the past year due to contractual maturities, improved liquidity flows have resulted in increases of a similar magnitude in the outstanding balance of fixed rate investment securities, and this has served to moderate further increases in the asset sensitive positioning. Our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume, mix, maturity and pricing of loan and deposit flows. As changes occur to the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy, management evaluates hedging opportunities that would change the reported interest rate risk profile. The results of additional simulation analyses that make use of alternative interest rate paths and customer behavior assumptions indicate that net interest income improvement in a rising rate environment could be diminished, and actual results may be different than the policy simulation results in Figure 33. Net interest income improvements are highly dependent on the timing, magnitude, frequency and path of interest rate increases and assumption inputs for deposit re pricing relationships, lending spreads and the balance behavior of transaction accounts. We also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second year of a two year horizon. These simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a twelve month horizon. To capture longer term exposures, we calculate exposures to changes to the EVE as discussed in the following section. Economic value of equity modeling. EVE complements net interest income simulation analysis since it estimates risk exposure beyond twelve and twenty four month horizons. EVE measures the extent to which the economic values of assets, liabilities and off balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. EVE is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates, and measuring the resulting change in the values of assets and liabilities under multiple interest rate paths. Under the current level of market interest rates, the calculation of EVE under an immediate 200 basis point decrease in interest rates results in certain interest rates declining to zero and a less than 200 basis point decrease in certain yield curve term points. This analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities. Those assumptions are based on historical behaviors, as well as our expectations. We identify actions that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our EVE will decrease by more than 15% in response to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates. We are operating within these guidelines. Management of interest rate exposure. We use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate Asset Liability Management strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures. Specifically, we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities, issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates, and using derivatives predominantly in the form of interest rate swaps, which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities. Figure 34 shows all swap positions which we hold for A/LM purposes. These positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed upon amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index. For example, fixed rate debt is converted to a floating rate through a receive fixed/pay variable interest rate swap. The volume, maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader A/LM objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. For more information about how we use interest rate swaps to manage our risk profile, see Note 8 (Derivatives and Hedging Activities). 75 Table of Contents Figure 34.

Derivatives not designated in hedge relationships Our derivatives that are not designated in hedge relationships are described in Note 8. We use a VAR simulation model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and credit spreads on the fair value of this portfolio. Using two years of historical information, the model estimates the maximum potential one day loss with a 95% confidence level. Statistically, this means that losses will exceed VAR, on average, five out of 100 trading days, or three to four times each quarter. We manage exposure to market risk in accordance with VAR limits for trading activity that have been approved by the Risk Capital Committee whose market risk management responsibilities are now performed by the Market Risk Committee established as part of Keys ERM Program. At December 31, 2010, the aggregate one day trading limit set by the committee was $6.9 million. We are operating within these constraints. During 2010, our aggregate daily average, minimum and maximum VAR amounts were $1.8 million, $1.2 million and $2.5 million, respectively. In 2009, our aggregate daily average, minimum and maximum VAR amounts were $2.8 million, $2.1 million and $3.7 million, respectively. In addition to comparing VAR exposure against limits on a daily basis, we monitor loss limits, use sensitivity measures and conduct stress tests. We report our market risk exposure to the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors. Liquidity risk management We define liquidity as the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences. Liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned, as well as unanticipated, changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions. Governance structure We manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated basis. This approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity, as well as each entitys capacity to manage through adverse conditions. It also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to sufficient funding. Oversight of the liquidity risk management process is governed by the KeyCorp Boards Risk Management Committee, the KeyBank Board of Directors, the ERM Committee and the ALCO. These groups regularly review various liquidity reports, including liquidity and funding summaries, liquidity trends, peer comparisons, variance analyses, liquidity projections, hypothetical funding erosion stress tests and goal tracking reports. The reviews generate a discussion of positions, trends and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of the decisions that we make. When liquidity pressure is elevated, monitoring of positions is heightened and reporting is more intensive. We meet with individuals within and outside of the company on a daily basis to discuss emerging issues. In addition, we use a variety of daily liquidity reports to monitor the flow of funds. Factors affecting liquidity Our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events. An example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency. Examples of indirect events (events unrelated to us) that could impact our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war, natural disasters, political events, or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation, mutual fund or hedge fund. Similarly, market speculation, or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources. 76 Table of Contents On November 1, 2010, Moodys, a credit rating agency that rates KeyCorp and KeyBank debt securities, announced the downgrade of ratings of ten large U.S. regional banks, including KeyBank, previously identified as benefiting from systemic support. KeyBanks short term borrowings, senior long term debt and subordinated debt ratings received a one notch downgrade from P 1 to P 2, A2 to A3, and A3 to Baa1, respectively. The new ratings have breached minimum thresholds established by Moodys in connection with the securitizations that Key services, and impact the ability of KeyBank to hold certain escrow deposit balances related to commercial mortgage securitizations serviced by Key and rated by Moodys. These escrow deposit balances range from $1.50 to $1.85 billion. Since the downgrade, KeyBank has been in discussions with Moodys regarding an alternative investment vehicle for these funds that would be acceptable to Moodys and maintain the funds at KeyBank. Subsequent to Moodys announcement that was publicly issued on January 19, 2011, Moodys indicated to KeyBank that certain escrow deposits associated with our mortgage servicing operations will be required to be moved to another financial institution which meets the minimum ratings threshold within the first quarter of 2011. As a result of this decision by Moodys, KeyBank has determined that moving these escrow deposit balances results in an immaterial impairment of these mortgage servicing assets. KeyBank has ample liquidity reserves to offset the loss of these deposits and expects to remain in a strong liquidity position. Managing liquidity risk We regularly monitor our funding sources and measure our capacity to obtain funds in a variety of scenarios in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable funding. In the normal course of business, we perform a monthly hypothetical funding erosion stress test for both KeyCorp and KeyBank. In a heightened monitoring mode, we may conduct the hypothetical funding erosion stress tests more frequently, and use assumptions so the stress tests are more strenuous and reflect the changed market environment. Erosion stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods. Ultimately, they estimate the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations. To compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures, we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed. We continue to reposition our balance sheet to reduce future reliance on wholesale funding and maintain a strong liquid asset portfolio. During the third quarter of 2009, our secured borrowings matured and were not replaced, though we retain the capacity to utilize secured borrowings as a contingent funding source. We maintain a Contingency Funding Plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis. The Plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions. It also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for effectively managing liquidity through a problem period. As part of the Plan, we maintain a liquidity reserve through balances in our liquid asset portfolio which during a problem period could reduce our potential reliance on wholesale funding. The portfolio at December 31, 2010 totaled $11.7 billion. The liquid asset portfolio balance consisted of $9.1 billion of unpledged securities, $2.2 billion of securities available for secured funding at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati and $362 million of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our Federal Reserve account. Additionally, as of December 31, 2010, our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was $11.3 billion at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and $1.8 billion at the Federal Home Loan Bank. Long term liquidity strategy Our long term liquidity strategy is to be core deposit funded with reduced reliance on wholesale funding. Key Community Bank supports our client insight driven relationship strategy, with the objective of achieving greater reliance on deposit based funding to reduce our liquidity risk. We use the loan to deposit ratio as a metric to monitor this strategy. Our target loan to deposit ratio is between 90 100%, which we calculate as total loans, loans held for sale, and nonsecuritized discontinued loans divided by domestic deposits. Sources of liquidity Our primary sources of funding include customer deposits, wholesale funding, liquid assets, and capital. If the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances, we rely on wholesale funding or liquid assets. Conversely, excess cash generated by operating, investing and deposit gathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets. We actively manage liquidity using a variety of nondeposit sources, including short and long term debt, and secured borrowings. Liquidity programs We have several wholesale funding programs, which are described in Note 14 (Short Term Borrowings), which enable the parent company and KeyBank to raise funds in the public and private markets when the capital markets are functioning 77 Table of Contents normally. The proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. Each of the programs is replaced or renewed as needed. There are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs. Liquidity for KeyCorp The parent company has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt; support customary corporate operations and activities (including acquisitions) and occasional guarantees of subsidiarys obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences; and pay dividends to shareholders. Our primary tool for assessing parent company liquidity is the net short term cash position, which measures the ability to fund debt maturing in twenty four months or less with existing liquid assets. Another key measure of parent company liquidity is the liquidity gap, which represents the difference between projected liquid assets and anticipated financial obligations over specified time horizons. We generally rely upon the issuance of term debt to manage the liquidity gap within targeted ranges assigned to various time periods. Typically, the parent company meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from KeyBank. Federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval. A national banks dividend paying capacity is affected by several factors, including net profits (as defined by statute) for the two previous calendar years and for the current year, up to the date of dividend declaration. During 2010, KeyBank did not pay any dividends to the parent; however, nonbank subsidiaries paid the parent $25 million in dividends. As of the close of business on December 31, 2010, KeyBank would not have been permitted to pay dividends to the parent without prior regulatory approval. To compensate for the absence of dividends, the parent company has relied upon the issuance of long term debt and stock. During 2010, the parent made capital infusions of $100 million to KeyBank, compared to $1.2 billion during 2009. The parent company generally maintains cash and short term investments in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over the next twenty four months. At December 31, 2010, the parent company held $3.3 billion in short term investments, which we projected to be sufficient to repay our maturing debt obligations. During 2010, the parent company issued $750 million of a five year medium term fixed rate senior note. We believe that this successful issuance demonstrates our ability to access the wholesale funding markets without an FDIC guarantee. Additional cash flow at the parent included $602 million of maturing debt, $286 million of interest and dividend payments, and various other cash flows netting to a $24 million outflow. Our liquidity position and recent activity Over the past twelve months, we have increased our liquid asset portfolio, which includes overnight and short term investments, as well as unencumbered, high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios. Liquidity stress scenarios include the loss of access to either unsecured or secured funding sources, as well as draws on unfunded commitments and significant deposit withdrawals. From time to time, KeyCorp or its principal subsidiary, KeyBank, may seek to retire, repurchase or exchange outstanding debt, capital securities or preferred stock through cash purchase, privately negotiated transactions or other means. Such transactions depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity and capital requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. We generate cash flows from operations, and from investing and financing activities. During 2010, we used the proceeds from loan paydowns and maturities of short term investments to increase the balance of our securities available for sale portfolio. During 2009, the issuance of Common Shares was used to fund the reduction of short term borrowings and long term debt and to increase the balance of our securities available for sale portfolio. The consolidated statements of cash flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for each year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Credit ratings Our credit ratings at December 31, 2010 are shown in Figure 35. We believe that these credit ratings, under normal conditions in the capital markets, will enable the parent company or KeyBank to issue fixed income securities to investors. Conditions in the credit markets have materially improved relative to the disruption experienced between the third quarter of 2007 and the third quarter of 2009; however, the availability of credit is limited and the cost of funds is higher than what was experienced prior to the market disruption. Figure 35 reflects the credit ratings of KeyCorp securities at December 31, 2010. If our credit ratings fall below investment grade, that event could have a material adverse effect on us. Such downgrades could adversely affect access to liquidity and could significantly increase our cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of 78 Table of Contents investors and counterparties willing to lend to us. Ultimately, credit ratings downgrades could adversely affect our business operations and reduce our ability to generate income. On April 27, 2010, Moodys, a credit rating agency that rates KeyCorp and KeyBank debt securities, indicated that, if enacted into law, the financial reform bill then proposed by Senator Christopher Dodd could result in lower debt and deposit ratings for seventeen U.S. banks, including KeyBank, because the legislation could weaken Moodys assumptions regarding the systemic support provided to the largest financial institutions. Moodys has publicly reported that KeyCorp holding company ratings did not benefit from any uplift as a result of a systemic support assumption by Moodys. KeyBank long term deposit and senior debt ratings were identified as receiving a one notch uplift due to systemic support. Subsequently, on July 27, 2010, Moodys announced its review for possible downgrade of the ratings of the ten large U.S. regional banks, including KeyBank. According to Moodys, the ratings reviewed benefited from an expectation of increased government support since 2009. Moodys review considered its government support assumptions in light of the recent passage of the Dodd Frank Act. KeyBank long term deposit, short term borrowings, senior long term debt, and subordinated long term debt ratings were previously identified among the ratings under review for possible downgrade. On November 1, 2010, Moodys announced the downgrade of KeyBanks short term borrowings, senior long term debt and subordinated debt one notch from P 1 to P 2, A2 to A3, and A3 to Baa1, respectively. In conjunction with the ratings changes, Moodys upgraded their ratings outlook on the ratings from negative to stable. Subsequent to Moodys announcement that was publicly issued January 19, 2011, Moodys indicated to KeyBank that certain escrow deposits related to our mortgage servicing operations will be required to be moved to another financial institution which meets the minimum ratings threshold within the first quarter of 2011. For information on the impact that Moodys action has had, see Note 9 (Mortgage Servicing Assets). Figure 35.

Like other financial services institutions, we make loans, extend credit, purchase securities and enter into financial derivative contracts, all of which have related credit risk. Credit policy, approval and evaluation We manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program. Risk committees approve both retail and commercial credit policies. These policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit. Our credit risk management is responsible for credit approval, is independent of our lines of business, and consists of senior officers who have extensive experience in structuring and approving loans. Only credit risk management is authorized to grant significant exceptions to credit policies. It is not unusual to make exceptions to established policies when mitigating circumstances dictate, but most major lending units have been assigned specific thresholds to keep exceptions at a manageable level. Loan grades are assigned at the time of origination, verified by credit risk management and periodically reevaluated thereafter. Most extensions of credit are subject to loan grading or scoring. This risk rating methodology blends our judgment with quantitative modeling. Commercial loans generally are assigned two internal risk ratings. The first rating reflects the probability that the borrower will default on an obligation; the second rating reflects expected recovery rates on the credit facility. Default probability is determined based on, among other factors, the financial strength of the borrower, an assessment of the borrowers management, the borrowers competitive position within its industry sector and our view of industry risk within the context of the general economic outlook. Types of exposure, transaction structure and collateral, including credit risk mitigants, affect the expected recovery assessment. 79 Table of Contents Credit risk management uses risk models to evaluate consumer loans. These models, known as scorecards, forecast the probability of serious delinquency and default for an applicant. The scorecards are embedded in the application processing system, which allows for real time scoring and automated decisions for many of our products. We periodically validate the loan grading and scoring processes. We maintain an active concentration management program to encourage diversification in our credit portfolios. For individual obligors, we employ a sliding scale of exposure, known as hold limits, which is dictated by the strength of the borrower. Our legal lending limit is approximately $2 billion for any individual borrower. However, internal hold limits generally restrict the largest exposures to approximately 25% of that amount. As of December 31, 2010, we had two client relationships with loan commitments of more than $200 million. The average amount outstanding on these two individual obligor commitments was $94 million at December 31, 2010. In general, our philosophy is to maintain a diverse portfolio with regard to credit exposures. We manage industry concentrations using several methods. On smaller portfolios, we may set limits based on a percentage of our total loan portfolio. On larger or higher risk portfolios, we may establish a specific dollar commitment level or a maximum level of economic capital. In addition to these precautions discussed above, we actively manage the overall loan portfolio in a manner consistent with asset quality objectives, including the use of credit derivatives primarily credit default swaps to mitigate credit risk. Credit default swaps enable us to transfer a portion of the credit risk associated with a particular extension of credit to a third party. At December 31, 2010, we used credit default swaps with a notional amount of $985 million to manage the credit risk associated with specific commercial lending obligations. We also sell credit derivatives primarily index credit default swaps to diversify and manage portfolio concentration and correlation risks. At December 31, 2010, the notional amount of credit default swaps sold by us for the purpose of diversifying our credit exposure was $431 million. Occasionally, we have provided credit protection to other lenders through the sale of credit default swaps. These transactions with other lenders generated fee income. Credit default swaps are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Related gains or losses, as well as the premium paid or received for credit protection, are included in the trading income component of noninterest income. These swaps decreased our operating results by $23 million for 2010 compared to a decrease of $37 million last year. We also manage the loan portfolio using portfolio swaps and bulk purchases and sales. Our overarching goal is to manage the loan portfolio within a specified range of asset quality. Selected asset quality statistics for each of the past five years are presented in Figure 36. The factors that drive these statistics are discussed in the remainder of this section. Figure 36.

Watch and criticized assets Watch assets are troubled commercial loans with the potential to deteriorate in quality due to the clients current financial condition and possible inability to perform in accordance with the terms of the underlying contract. Criticized assets are troubled loans and other assets that show additional signs of weakness that may lead, or have led, to an interruption in scheduled repayments from primary sources, potentially requiring us to rely on repayment from secondary sources, such as collateral liquidation. Criticized assets showed significant improvement during 2010 from one year ago. 80 Table of Contents Allowance for loan and lease losses At December 31, 2010, the allowance for loan and lease losses was $1.6 billion, or 3.20% of loans, compared to $2.5 billion, or 4.31%, at December 31, 2009. The allowance includes $58 million that was specifically allocated for impaired loans of $621 million at December 31, 2010, compared to $300 million that was allocated for impaired loans of $1.6 billion one year ago. For more information about impaired loans, see Note 5 (Asset Quality). At December 31, 2010, the allowance for loan and lease losses was 150.19% of nonperforming loans, compared to 115.87% at December 31, 2009. We estimate the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses on at least a quarterly basis. The methodology used is described in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) under the heading Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses. Briefly, we apply historical loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions, changes in credit policies or underwriting standards, and changes in the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets. For all TDRs, regardless of size, as well as impaired loans having an outstanding balance greater than $2.5 million, we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss content and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate. A specific allowance also may be assigned even when sources of repayment appear sufficient if we remain uncertain about whether the loan will be repaid in full. The allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2010 represents our best estimate of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date. As shown in Figure 37, our allowance for loan and lease losses decreased by $930 million, or 37%, during the past twelve months. In general, this decrease is attributed to an improved economic outlook, more favorable conditions in the capital markets, improvement in client income statements, and continued run off in the exit loan portfolio. More specifically, this contraction was associated with favorable risk rating migration experienced in the loan portfolio throughout the year, coupled with a decline in loans outstanding and a reduction in our general allowance, which encompasses the application of historical loss rates to our existing loans with similar risk characteristics and assessment of factors such as changes in economic condition and changes in credit policies or underwriting standards. Both Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank showed a decline in their level of allowance during 2010. The largest declines occurred in the Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services and National Leasing lines of business. These lines of business experienced the most significant improvement in the underlying credit metrics which determine the allowance. Our delinquency trends continued to decline during 2010. Our liability for credit losses on lending related commitments decreased since 2009 by $48 million to $73 million at December 31, 2010. When combined with our allowance for loan and lease losses, our total allowance for credit losses represented 3.35% of loans at the end of 2010 compared to 4.52% at the end of 2009. 81 Table of Contents Figure 37.

Our provision for loan and lease losses was $638 million for 2010, compared to $3.2 billion for 2009. Our net loan charge offs for 2010 exceeded the provision for loan and lease losses by $932 million. The decrease in our provision is due to the improving credit quality we have experienced in most of our loan portfolios and the reduction of our outstanding loan balances. Additionally, we continue to work our exit loans through the credit cycle, and reduce exposure in our higher risk businesses including the residential properties portion of our construction loan portfolio, Marine/RV financing, and other selected leasing portfolios through the sale of certain loans, payments from borrowers or net charge offs. As these outstanding loan balances decrease, so does their required allowance for loan and lease losses and corresponding provision. 82 Table of Contents Net loan charge offs Net loan charge offs for 2010 totaled $1.6 billion, or 2.91% of average loans from continuing operations. These results compare to net charge offs of $2.3 billion, or 3.40%, for the same period last year. Figure 38 shows the trend in our net loan charge offs by loan type, while the composition of loan charge offs and recoveries by type of loan is presented in Figure 39. Over the past twelve months, net charge offs in the commercial loan portfolio decreased by $673 million, due primarily to commercial real estate related credits within the Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services line of business. Net charge offs for this line of business decreased $361 million from 2009, and included $131 million of net charge offs recorded on two specific customer relationships during the fourth quarter of 2009. As shown in Figure 41, our exit loan portfolio accounted for $453 million, or 29%, of total net loan charge offs for 2010. Figure 38.

These concessions are made to improve the collectability of the loan and generally take the form of a reduction of the interest rate, extension of the maturity date or reduction in the principal balance. (b) During the second quarter of 2008, we transferred $384 million of commercial real estate loans ($719 million of primarily construction loans, net of $335 million in net charge offs) from the loan portfolio to held for sale status. (c) See Figure 18 and the accompanying discussion in the Loans and loans held for sale section for more information related to our commercial real estate portfolio. (d) Included in the commercial, financial and agricultural portfolio is a $67 million middle market past due credit which was resolved in January 2011. As shown in Figure 40, nonperforming assets decreased during 2010, having declined for the past four consecutive quarters. Most of the reduction came from nonperforming loans and OREO in the Commercial Real Estate line of business. As shown in Figure 41, our exit loan portfolio accounted for $210 million, or 16%, of total nonperforming assets at December 31, 2010, compared to $599 million, or 24%, in 2009. At December 31, 2010, the carrying amount of our commercial nonperforming loans outstanding represented 60% of their original face value, and total nonperforming loans outstanding represented 66% of their face value. At the same date, OREO 85 Table of Contents represented 52% of its original face value, while loans held for sale and other nonperforming assets in the aggregate represented 47% of their face value. At December 31, 2010, our 20 largest nonperforming loans totaled $306 million, representing 29% of total loans on nonperforming status from continuing operations as compared to $582 million representing 26%, respectively in the prior year. Figure 41 shows the composition of our exit loan portfolio at December 31, 2010 and 2009, the net charge offs recorded on this portfolio, and the nonperforming status of these loans at these dates. The exit loan portfolio represented 11% of total loans and loans held for sale at December 31, 2010 as compared to 13% at December 31, 2009. Figure 41.

Figure 42 shows credit exposure by industry classification in the largest sector of our loan portfolio, commercial, financial and agricultural loans. Since December 31, 2009, total commitments and loans outstanding in this sector have decreased by $5.7 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. The types of activity that caused the change in our nonperforming loans during 2010 and 2009 are summarized in Figure 43. As shown in this figure, nonperforming loans declined as loans placed on nonaccrual decreased for the fourth consecutive quarter and loans sold and payments received on nonperforming loans increased in 2010 as compared to 2009, as market liquidity improved. 86 Table of Contents Figure 42.

Operational risk also encompasses compliance (legal) risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules and regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards and contractual obligations. Due to the passage of the Dodd Frank Act, large financial companies like Key will be subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation due to their systemic importance. This heightened level of regulation will increase our operational risk. We have created and continue to create work teams to respond to and analyze the new regulatory requirements imposed upon us and that will be promulgated as a result of the enactment of the Dodd Frank Act. Resulting losses could take the form of explicit charges, increased operational costs, harm to our reputation or forgone opportunities. We seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk, alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance, a system of internal controls and reporting. We continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with laws, rules and regulations, and to improve the oversight of our operational risk. For example, an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses. This tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action. We also rely upon software programs designed to assist in the assessment of operational risk and monitoring our control processes. This technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the Board of Directors. Primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business. Our Operational Risk Management function manages the Operational Risk Management Program which provides the framework for the structure, governance, roles and responsibilities as well as the content to manage operational risk for Key. The Operational Risk Committee, a senior management committee, oversees our level of operational risk, and directs and supports our operational infrastructure and related activities. This committee and the Operational Risk Management function are an integral part of our ERM Program. Our Risk Review function periodically assesses the overall effectiveness of our Operational Risk Management Program and our system of internal controls. Risk Review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the Audit Committee, and independently supports the Audit Committees oversight of these controls. Fourth Quarter Results Our financial performance for each of the past eight quarters is summarized in Figure 46. Highlights of our results for the fourth quarter of 2010 are summarized below. Earnings We had a fourth quarter net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $292 million, or $.33 per Common Share, compared to a net loss from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $258 million, or $.30 per Common Share, for the fourth quarter of 2009. The fourth quarter 2010 results reflect an improvement in pre provision net revenue and lower credit costs from the same period one year ago. The fourth quarter 2009 results were negatively impacted by a $756 million loan and lease loss provision. Fourth quarter 2010 net income attributable to Key common shareholders was $279 million compared to a net loss attributable to Key common shareholders of $265 million for the same quarter one year ago. On an annualized basis, our return on average total assets from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2010 was 1.53%, compared to (.94)% for the fourth quarter of 2009. The annualized return on average common equity from continuing operations was 13.71% for the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to (12.60)% for the year ago quarter. 88 Table of Contents Net interest income Our taxable equivalent net interest income was $635 million for the fourth quarter of 2010, and the net interest margin was 3.31%. These results compare to taxable equivalent net interest income of $637 million and a net interest margin of 3.04% for the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase in the net interest margin is primarily attributable to lower funding costs. We continue to experience an improvement in the mix of deposits by reducing the level of higher costing certificates of deposit and growing lower costing transaction accounts. This benefit to the net interest margin was partially offset by a lower level of average earning assets compared to the same period one year ago resulting from pay downs on loans. Noninterest income Our noninterest income was $526 million for the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to $469 million for the year ago quarter. Investment banking and capital markets income increased $110 million compared to the same period one year ago. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we incurred losses on certain real estate investments, recorded additional reserves on customer derivative positions, and recorded a loss on certain commercial mortgage backed securities. In total, these amounted to a reduction of fee income of $87 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. This compares to income of $18 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 as a result of improved credit quality. In addition, net gains from loan sales increased $34 million from the fourth quarter of 2009, and a gain of $28 million was realized from the sale of Tuition Management Systems in the fourth quarter of 2010. These gains were partially offset by decreases of $86 million in net gains (losses) from principal investing (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests), $12 million in service charges on deposit accounts, and $10 million in operating lease income from the fourth quarter of 2009. Noninterest expense Our noninterest expense was $744 million for the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to $871 million for the same period last year. We recorded a credit of $26 million to the provision for losses on lending related commitments during the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to a charge to the provision of $27 million in the year ago quarter. Also contributing to the decrease in noninterest expense was a decline in employee benefits expense of $41 million as a result of lower pension expense and medical claims expense. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2010, operating lease expense was $22 million less and OREO expense was $15 million less than the year ago quarter. Provision for loan and lease losses Our provision for loan and lease losses was a credit of $97 million for the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to a charge of $756 million for the year ago quarter. Our allowance for loan and lease losses was $1.6 billion, or 3.20% of total period end loans, at December 31, 2010, compared to 4.31% at December 31, 2009. Net loan charge offs for the quarter totaled $256 million, or 2.00%, of average loans. These results compare to $708 million, or 4.64%, for the same period last year and $357 million, or 2.69%, for the previous quarter. Net loan charge offs declined each quarter during 2010 and are at their lowest level since the first quarter of 2008. Our exit loan portfolio accounted for $81 million, or 32%, of total net loan charge offs for the fourth quarter of 2010. Income taxes For the fourth quarter of 2010, we recorded a tax provision of $172 million, compared to a benefit of $274 for the fourth quarter of 2009. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2010 was 33.7% compared with a 41.4% for the same quarter one year prior. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we recorded domestic deferred income tax expense of $32 million as the result of our change in assertion as to indefinitely reinvesting in non US subsidiaries. The tax benefit recorded during the fourth quarter of 2009 was primarily a result of a pre tax loss from continuing operations. 89 Table of Contents Figure 46.
