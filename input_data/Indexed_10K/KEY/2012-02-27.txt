These terms are defined in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) which begins on page 113. 35 Table of Contents Introduction This section generally reviews the financial condition and results of operations of KeyCorp and its subsidiaries for each of the past three years. Some tables may include additional periods to comply with disclosure requirements or to illustrate trends in greater depth. When you read this discussion, you should also refer to the consolidated financial statements and related notes in this report. The page locations of specific sections that we refer to are presented in the table of contents. Terminology Throughout this discussion, references to Key, we, our, us and similar terms refer to the consolidated entity consisting of KeyCorp and its subsidiaries. KeyCorp refers solely to the parent holding company, and KeyBank refers to KeyCorps subsidiary bank, KeyBank National Association. We want to explain some industry specific terms at the outset so you can better understand the discussion that follows. We use the phrase continuing operations in this document to mean all of our businesses other than the education lending business and Austin. Results for the education lending business and Austin have been accounted for as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Our exit loan portfolios are separate from our discontinued operations. These portfolios, which are in a run off mode, stem from product lines we decided to cease because they no longer fit with our corporate strategy. These exit loan portfolios are included in Other Segments. We engage in capital markets activities primarily through business conducted by our Key Corporate Bank segment. These activities encompass a variety of products and services. Among other things, we trade securities as a dealer, enter into derivative contracts (both to accommodate clients financing needs and for proprietary trading purposes), and conduct transactions in foreign currencies (both to accommodate clients needs and to benefit from fluctuations in exchange rates). For regulatory purposes, capital is divided into two classes. Federal regulations currently prescribe that at least one half of a bank or bank holding companys total risk based capital must qualify as Tier 1 capital. Both total and Tier 1 capital serve as bases for several measures of capital adequacy, which is an important indicator of financial stability and condition. As described in the section entitled Supervision and Regulation, the regulators are required to conduct a supervisory capital assessment of the BHCs with assets of at least $50 billion, including KeyCorp. As part of this capital adequacy review, banking regulators evaluate a component of Tier 1 capital, known as Tier 1 common equity. For more information on total capital, Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common equity, and how they are calculated see the section entitled Capital. During the first quarter of 2010, we re aligned our reporting structure for our segments. Previously, the Consumer Finance business group consisted mainly of portfolios that were identified as exit or run off portfolios and were included in our Key Corporate Bank segment. We are now reflecting these exit loan portfolios in Other Segments. The automobile dealer floor plan business, previously included in Consumer Finance, has been re aligned with the Commercial Banking line of business within the Key Community Bank segment. In addition, other previously identified exit portfolios included in the Key Corporate Bank segment, including our homebuilder loans from the Real Estate Capital line of business and commercial leases from the Equipment Finance line of business, have been moved to Other Segments. For more detailed financial information pertaining to each segment and its respective lines of business, see Note 21 (Line of Business Results). Additionally, a comprehensive list of the acronyms and abbreviations used throughout this discussion is included in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). 36 Table of Contents Figure 1.

Economic overview Economic and political uncertainty and financial market volatility were the dominant themes throughout 2011. The year began with optimism that the economic recovery in the United States was finally gaining momentum three years after the financial crisis of 2008 sparked the worst recession since the Great Depression. That optimism quickly faded during the first quarter of 2011 after multiple economic shocks interrupted the recovery. First, political unrest in North Africa and the Middle East resulted in volatility in oil and gas prices, lessening the consumers discretionary purchasing power. Then the natural disasters in Japan created manufacturing supply chain disruptions, which slowed U.S. industrial production and growth. Finally, awareness of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe increased and financial market volatility heightened. Equity markets reeled over fears that fiscal austerity in Europe would lead to a weakening of their banking sector, and European leaders were unable to allay those concerns. The environment was further intensified by the U.S. debt ceiling debate that ultimately led to the historic downgrade of the United States AAA credit rating by Standard & Poors. U.S. employers added 1.82 million jobs in 2011. This compares favorably to the 1 million jobs added in 2010. The unemployment rate in December of 2011 decreased to 8.5%, compared to the 9.4% rate at the end of 2010. While the unemployment rate showed improvement throughout the year, it remained considerably higher than the ten year average unemployment rate of 6.5%. Despite the improving job market, U.S. consumers, whose confidence had been rattled by the news headlines throughout the year, were hesitant to spend. The average monthly rate of consumer spending increased 0.3% for 2011 compared to an average monthly increase of 0.4% for 2010. Spending was also tempered by rising inflationary pressures, as consumer prices in December of 2011 increased at an annual rate of 3.0%, up from the 1.5% increase for all of 2010. The housing market remained weak throughout 2011 and continued to be a drag on the recovery. In December of 2011 new home sales decreased 7% from December of 2010, while the median price of new homes decreased by 13% over the same period. Building activity improved modestly as housing starts at the end of 2011 increased 25% from a year earlier, but still remained at historically low levels. Existing home sales also remained weak as lower mortgage rates and price discounts were not enough to lure buyers back into the market. In December of 2011 existing home sales increased 4% from the same month a year ago, and the median price of existing homes decreased by 3% over the same period. While remaining historically elevated, the number of new foreclosures decreased 20% in December of 2011 from a year earlier. The Federal Reserve held the federal funds target rate near zero and took further accommodative monetary policy actions in 2011. The Federal Reserve continued to expand its holdings of Treasury securities during the first half of the year as announced in November of 2010. As the economic outlook weakened in the second half of 2011, the Federal Reserve attempted to increase its transparency in August by stating that it would keep the federal funds rate at exceptionally low levels at least through mid 2013. The Federal Reserve updated this communication in January of 2012 to indicate that conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014. Furthermore, in an attempt to lower longer term borrowing rates to consumers and businesses, the Federal Reserve announced a program in September dubbed Operation Twist by investors. This program involves the Federal Reserve purchasing $400 billion of U. S. Treasury securities with longer maturities 38 Table of Contents while selling the same amount of U. S. Treasury securities with shorter maturities. These actions along with the recognition of a weakening global economy contributed to a drop in benchmark term interest rates. The benchmark two year U.S. Treasury yield declined from 0.60% at December 31, 2010 to 0.24% at December 30, 2011. The ten year U.S. Treasury yield, which began the year at 3.30%, decreased by 1.42% to close 2011 at 1.88%. The S&P 500 equity index, which had been up over 8% for the year through April of 2011 and then down almost 13% for the year through October of 2011, ended the year approximately unchanged. Long term financial goals Our long term financial goals are as follows: Target a loan to core deposit ratio range of 90% to 100%. Return to a moderate risk profile by targeting a net charge off ratio range of .40% to .50%. Grow high quality and diverse revenue streams by targeting a net interest margin in excess of 3.50% and ratio of noninterest income to total revenue of greater than 40%. Create positive operating leverage and target an efficiency ratio in the range of 60 to 65%. Achieve a return on average assets in the range of 1.00% to 1.25%. Figure 2 shows the evaluation of our long term financial goals for the fourth quarter of 2011 and the year ended 2011. Figure 2.

Corporate strategy We remain committed to enhancing long term shareholder value by continued execution of our business plan, growing our franchise and being disciplined in our managing of capital. We are achieving this by implementing 39 Table of Contents our 2011/2012 strategic priorities. In short, we grow by building enduring relationships through client focused solutions and extraordinary service. Our strategic priorities for enhancing long term shareholder value are as follows: Grow profitability. We continue to focus on increasing revenues and controlling costs. We will continue to leverage technology and grow in ways that are sustainable and consistent with our core relationship strategy to achieve this objective. Acquire and grow relationships. By keeping our clients at the center of all we do, we will acquire and retain the right clients, and then fully develop those relationships in ways that are mutually beneficial to both our clients and Key. We will continue to leverage the alignment of our franchise across business lines to support the needs of our clients. Effectively manage risk and reward. We will continue to tackle our opportunities with a disciplined approach that effectively balances rewards consistent with our risk appetite. Our employees must have a clear understanding of our risk tolerance with regard to factors such as asset quality, operational risk and liquidity levels to ensure that we operate within our desired risk appetite. Maintain financial strength. With the foundation of a strong balance sheet, we will continue to stay focused on sustaining strong reserves, liquidity and capital. We also will balance effective expense control with sound investments to enhance our capabilities and grow our business. Engage a talented and diverse workforce. We are committed to investing in our workforce to optimize the talent in our organization. We will continue to stress the importance of training, retaining, developing and challenging our employees. We believe through our employees focused execution we will continue to win with our clients and drive results consistent with our strategic priorities. Strategic developments We initiated the following actions during 2011 and 2010 to support our corporate strategy: We returned to profitability in 2010 and remained profitable throughout 2011. The results for 2011 were primarily due to lower credit costs and an improvement in noninterest expense, as compared to 2010, as our new leadership team implemented their commitment to focused strategy execution. On January 11, 2012, we signed a purchase and assumption agreement to acquire 37 retail branches in Buffalo and Rochester, NY. The deposits associated with these branches total approximately $2.4 billion, while loans total approximately $400 million. We will use this excess liquidity to fund debt maturities and loan growth. The transaction is expected to close in late second or early third quarter of 2012. We were recognized in a survey by American Customer Satisfaction Index, published in January of 2012, showing that we are one of only two large banks that improved its overall customer satisfaction score for two consecutive years. Our score is significantly more positive than the banking industry overall. During 2011, we continued to benefit from improved asset quality. From one year ago, nonperforming loans declined by $341 million to $727 million, and nonperforming assets decreased by $479 million to $859 million. Net charge offs during 2011 declined to $541 million, or 1.11% of average loan balances, compared to $1.6 billion, or 2.91% of average loan balances during 2010. At December 31, 2011 our capital ratios remained strong with a Tier 1 common equity ratio of 11.26%, our loan loss reserves were adequate at 2.03% to period end loans and we were core funded with a loan to deposit ratio of 87%. Our strong capital position provides us with the flexibility to support our clients and our business needs and to evaluate other appropriate capital deployment opportunities. For the year ended December 31, 2011, our efficiency ratio was 68%. 40 Table of Contents As previously reported, Key completed the repurchase of the $2.5 billion of Series B Preferred Stock and corresponding warrant issued to the U.S. Treasury Department. As a result of the repurchase, we recorded a $49 million one time deemed dividend in the first quarter of 2011 related to the remaining difference between the repurchase price and the carrying value of the preferred shares at the time of repurchase. Beginning with the second quarter of 2011, the repurchase resulted in the elimination of quarterly dividends of $31 million and discount amortization of $4 million, or $140 million on an annual basis, related to these preferred shares. In total, Key paid $2.867 billion to the U.S. Treasury during the investment period in the form of dividends, principal and repurchase of the warrant, resulting in a return to the U.S. Treasury of $367 million above the initial investment of $2.5 billion made on November 14, 2008. During March 2011, we completed a $625 million underwritten public offering of 70,621,470 of our Common Shares at a price of $8.85 per share, and a public offering of $1 billion 5.1% Senior Medium Term Notes, Series I. In May 2011, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $.03 per Common Share or $.12 on an annualized basis. This is a result of our return to sustained profitability, disciplined capital and expense management, and continued improvement in credit quality. During the second half of 2011, we formalized our Key Employee Promise, which is that Together, we have a strong sense of community where each one of us has the opportunity for personal growth, to do work that matters in a place where results are rewarded. This promise is built on our core values and supports our growth strategy of building enduring relationships through client focused solutions and extraordinary service. Henry L. Meyer retired on May 1, 2011, and Beth E. Mooney assumed the additional role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on that date, and became the first woman CEO of a top 20 U.S. bank. Mooney, who has over 30 years of experience in retail banking, commercial lending, and financing was President and Chief Operating Officer and a member of KeyCorps Board of Directors. During 2010, our balance sheet began to reflect strong capital, liquidity and reserve levels. In August 2010, we issued $750 million of five year senior unsecured debt at the holding company. Highlights of Our 2011 Performance Financial performance For 2011, we announced net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $857 million, or $.92 per Common Share. These results compare to net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $413 million, or $.47 per Common Share, for 2010. Figure 3 shows our continuing and discontinued operating results for the past three years. 41 Table of Contents Figure 3.

As a result of these decisions, we have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations. The loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2011, was primarily attributable to fair value adjustments related to the education lending securitization trusts. (b) Includes a $49 million deemed dividend recorded in the first quarter of 2011 related to the repurchase of the $2.5 billion Series B Preferred Stock. (c) EPS may not foot due to rounding. The earnings improvement in 2011 resulted from an improvement in credit quality, expense control and our success in growing our business when compared to 2010. Results in 2009 were adversely impacted by an elevated provision for loan and lease losses, write offs of certain intangible assets and write downs of certain commercial real estate related investments. In 2011, we benefited from the actions taken to strengthen our balance sheet, reduce risk, reposition our business and rebuild capital. Our 2011 full year results, lead us to believe that we have returned to solid and sustainable profitability, reached an inflection point in our loan portfolio, and have established peer leading capital levels. In 2012, we will continue to focus on cost control efforts as we invest in client facing positions and technology, continue to optimize our non client facing positions and occupancy costs, expend for marketing where we can deepen client relationships to improve future revenue and implement efficiency initiatives. The net interest margin from continuing operations was 3.16% for 2011. This was a decrease of ten basis points from 2010. This decrease was primarily attributable to a lower yield on average earning assets compared to the prior year, resulting primarily from the continuation of the low rate environment. We continue to experience an improvement in the mix of deposits by reducing the level of higher costing certificates of deposit and growing lower costing transaction accounts. This benefit along with reductions in administered rate deposits allowed us to maintain the spread between interest earning assets and our cost of funds during 2011 compared to 2010. Our expectation for 2012 is for the net interest margin to show modest improvement as we continue to anticipate our funding costs to decline. Average total loans increased $656 million during the fourth quarter, compared to the third quarter of 2011. This represented a 1.4% unannualized increase from the third quarter of 2011, and is the first time we have grown 42 Table of Contents quarterly average loan balances since the fourth quarter of 2008. The average balances of commercial, financial and agricultural loans increased from $17.4 billion to $18.3 billion, or approximately 5.4% unannualized. This is the third consecutive quarter average growth for the commercial, financial and agricultural portfolio. Our utilization rate of commercial, financial and agricultural loans improved from 44.4% in the third quarter of 2011 to 46.3% in the fourth quarter of 2011. This confirmed our belief that we reached an inflection point for loan growth in the third quarter of 2011. Our exit loan portfolio accounted for $119 million or, 13.85%, of our nonperforming assets at December 31, 2011 compared to $210 million, or 15.7%, at December 31, 2010, and $599 million, or 23.9%, at December 31, 2009. While we have made progress in decreasing our exit loan portfolio, we believe these loan balances will be running down more slowly in the future due to the longer term nature of these remaining loan portfolios. Our consolidated average loan to deposit ratio was 87% for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to 90% for the fourth quarter of 2010. This continued decline was accomplished by growing our noninterest bearing deposits, NOW and money market accounts, reducing our reliance on wholesale funding, exiting nonrelationship businesses and soft loan demand during the first half of 2011. We originated new or renewed lending commitments to consumers and businesses of approximately $10.5 billion during the fourth quarter and $36.6 billion for 2011. This annual amount compares to approximately $29.5 billion in 2010, an increase of 24%. Our trend of improving the mix of deposits continued during 2011 where we experienced a $5.4 billion or 11.9% increase in non time deposits. Approximately $6.8 billion of our certificates of deposit outstanding at December 31, 2011, will mature over the next four quarters, and included in these totals are approximately $2.5 billion of higher costing certificates of deposit originated prior to 2009. The breakdown of these higher costing certificates of deposits is as follows: $238 million at a 4.95% cost mature in the first quarter of 2012; $688 million at a 4.57% cost mature in the second quarter of 2012; $1.025 billion at a 5.06% cost mature in the third quarter of 2012; and $529 million at a 4.88% cost mature in the fourth quarter of 2012. These re pricing opportunities will continue to benefit our net interest margin. We experienced an improvement in our asset quality statistics during the fourth quarter of 2011. Net charge offs declined to $541 million or 1.11% of average loan balances for 2011 as compared to $1.6 billion and 2.91% for 2010. In addition, our nonperforming loans declined to $727 million or 1.47% of period end loans at December 31, 2011 compared to $1.1 billion or 2.13% at December 31, 2010. Our reserve for loan losses stood at $1 billion or 2.03% of period end loans compared to $1.6 billion or 3.20% at December 31, 2010, and represented 138% and 150% coverage of non performing loans at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. Also, criticized loans outstanding declined at December 31, 2011 for the 10th consecutive quarter. Information pertaining to our progress in reducing our commercial real estate exposure and our exit loan portfolio is presented in the section entitled Credit risk management. Looking to 2012, we anticipate continued improvement in asset quality, with lower levels of non performing assets and net charge offs for the year. Specifically with respect to net charge offs, during the first half of 2012, we anticipate the amount to be comparable to the second half of 2011. We anticipate the provision to be less than net charge offs in 2012. However, we expect that as loan growth continues in 2012, we will migrate during the course of the year for the provision to be closer to the level of net charge offs. There are a number of variables that impact the ultimate outcome including the composition of the loan portfolio at each quarter end. 43 Table of Contents Our tangible common equity ratio and Tier 1 common ratio both remain strong at December 31, 2011, at 9.88% and 11.26% respectively, as compared to 8.19% and 9.34% at December 31, 2010. These have placed us in the top quartile of our peer group on these ratios. We have identified four primary uses of capital. The first is investing in our businesses, supporting our clients and our loan growth. Second is maintaining or increasing our common stock dividend. Third is to return capital in the form of share repurchase to our shareholders. And then fourth is to be disciplined and opportunistic about how we could invest in our franchise to include selective acquisitions over time. The Federal Reserve is currently conducting a review of our Capital Plan under the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process. Until such time as they have completed their review and have no objection to our plan, we are not able to take any further actions to implement our plan. In the event the Federal Reserve would object to our plan, in whole or in part, we may submit a request for reconsideration of our plan within 10 days, which the Federal Reserve is required to respond to within 10 days. In such circumstances, absent receipt of a non objection following a request for reconsideration, we would be required to re submit our plan within 30 days. Upon receipt of a re submitted capital plan, the Federal Reserve has 75 days to notify the BHC of its objection or non objection. Should we receive an objection, it would likely delay any actions on capital management until later in the calendar year. On January 11, 2012, we signed a purchase and assumption agreement to acquire 37 retail branches in Buffalo and Rochester, NY. The deposits associated with these branches total approximately $2.4 billion, while loans total approximately $400 million. We plan to use this excess liquidity to fund debt maturities and loan growth. We are looking for opportunities to rationalize and optimize our existing branch network. In 2012, we plan to build approximately 20 new branches as compared to 40 new branches in 2011. Our focus will shift more toward relocations and consolidations to reposition our branch footprint, into more attractive market areas. Over the last two years, we have built 79 new branches, which net of closures and consolidations resulted in a net addition to our network of 51 branches. In addition, we have renovated approximately 129 branches during this time period. In total, approximately 40% of our branches are either new or have been renovated in the past five years as part of our branch modernization initiative. Figure 4 presents certain non GAAP financial measures related to tangible common equity and Tier 1 common equity. The tangible common equity ratio has been a focus for some investors. We believe this ratio may assist investors in analyzing our capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. Since the commencement of the CCAR process in early 2009, the Federal Reserve has focused its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of Tier 1 risk based capital known as Tier 1 common equity, a non GAAP financial measure. Because the Federal Reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders equity (essentially Tier 1 risk based capital less preferred stock, qualifying capital securities and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries) generally should be the dominant element in Tier 1 risk based capital, this focus on Tier 1 common equity is consistent with existing capital adequacy categories. This increased focus on Tier 1 common equity is also present in the Basel Committees Basel III guidelines, which U.S. regulators are expected to implement in the near future. The enactment of the Dodd Frank Act also changes the regulatory capital standards that apply to bank holding companies by requiring regulators to create rules phasing out the treatment of capital securities and cumulative preferred securities as Tier 1 eligible capital. This three year phase out period, which commences January 1, 2013, will ultimately result in our capital securities being treated only as Tier 2 capital. Tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by GAAP nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations; this measure is considered to be a non GAAP financial measure. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity and Tier 1 common equity, we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases. Figure 4 also reconciles the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non GAAP measures. 44 Table of Contents The table also shows the computation for pre provision net revenue, which is not formally defined by GAAP. Management believes that eliminating the effects of the provision for loan and lease losses makes it easier to analyze our results by presenting them on a more comparable basis. Non GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.

(b) Other assets deducted from Tier 1 capital and net risk weighted assets consist of disallowed deferred tax assets of $158 million at December 31, 2010, disallowed intangible assets (excluding goodwill), and deductible portions of nonfinancial equity investments. There were no disallowed deferred tax assets at December 31, 2011. Results of Operations Net interest income One of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets (such as loans and securities) and loan related fee income, and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings. There are several factors that affect net interest income, including: the volume, pricing, mix and maturity of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities; the volume and value of net free funds, such as noninterest bearing deposits and equity capital; the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk; 45 Table of Contents interest rate fluctuations and competitive conditions within the marketplace; and asset quality. To make it easier to compare results among several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets (some taxable, some not), we present net interest income in this discussion on a taxable equivalent basis (i.e., as if it were all taxable and at the same taxable rate). For example, $100 of tax exempt income would be presented as $154, an amount that if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% would yield $100. Figure 5 shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense, and their respective yields or rates over the past six years. This figure also presents a reconciliation of taxable equivalent net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with GAAP for each of those years. The net interest margin, which is an indicator of the profitability of the earning assets portfolio less cost of funding, is calculated by dividing net interest income by average earning assets. Taxable equivalent net interest income for 2011 was $2.3 billion, and the net interest margin was 3.16%. These results compare to taxable equivalent net interest income of $2.5 billion and a net interest margin of 3.26% for the prior year. The decrease in 2011 net interest income is primarily attributable to a lower level of average earning assets compared to the prior year, resulting primarily from pay downs on higher yielding loans, and the continuation of the low rate environment decreasing the value of noninterest bearing liabilities. We continue to experience an improvement in the mix of deposits by reducing the level of higher costing certificates of deposit and growing lower costing transaction accounts. We have also benefitted from pricing reductions on administered rate deposits. Average earning assets for 2011 totaled $73 billion, which was $5.5 billion, or 7%, lower than the 2010 level. This reduction reflects a $5.4 billion decrease in loans during the year, caused by soft demand for credit, paydowns on our portfolios as commercial clients deleveraged, and the run off in our exit portfolios. The size and composition of our loan portfolios were affected by the following actions during 2011, 2010 and 2009: We sold $2 billion of commercial real estate loans during 2011 and $1.2 billion during 2010. Since some of these loans have been sold with limited recourse (i.e., there is a risk that we will be held accountable for certain events or representations made in the sales agreements), we established and have maintained a loss reserve in an amount that we believe is appropriate. More information about the related recourse agreement is provided in Note 16 (Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees) under the heading Recourse agreement with FNMA. In addition to the sales of commercial real estate loans discussed above, we sold other loans totaling $1.5 billion (including $1.4 billion of residential real estate loans) during 2011 and $2 billion (including $1.6 billion of residential real estate loans) during 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we transferred loans with a fair value of $82 million from held for sale status to the held to maturity portfolio as a result of current market conditions and our related plans to restructure the terms of these loans. We sold $487 million of education loans (included in discontinued assets on the balance sheet) during 2010. In late September 2009, we decided to exit the government guaranteed education lending business and have applied discontinued operations accounting to the education lending business for all periods presented in this report. There were no education loans sold during 2011. We transferred $193 million of loans ($248 million, net of $55 million in net charge offs) from the held to maturity loan portfolio to held for sale status in late September 2009, in conjunction with additional actions taken to reduce our exposure in the commercial real estate and institutional portfolios through the sale of selected assets. Most of these loans were sold during October 2009. 46 Table of Contents Figure 5.

During the second quarter of 2008, our taxable equivalent net interest income was reduced by $838 million following an adverse federal court decision on our tax treatment of a leveraged sale leaseback transaction. During the first quarter of 2008, we increased our tax reserves for certain LILO transactions and recalculated our lease income in accordance with prescribed accounting standards. These actions reduced our first quarter 2008 taxable equivalent net interest income by $34 million. Excluding all of these reductions, the taxable equivalent yield on our commercial lease financing portfolio would have been 4.82% for 2008, and our taxable equivalent net interest margin would have been 3.13%. (g) Yield is calculated on the basis of amortized cost. (h) Rate calculation excludes basis adjustments related to fair value hedges. (i) A portion of long term debt and the related interest expense is allocated to discontinued liabilities as a result of applying our matched funds transfer pricing methodology to discontinued operations. 48 Table of Contents Figure 6 shows how the changes in yields or rates and average balances from the prior year affected net interest income.

Noninterest income Noninterest income for 2011 was $1.8 billion, down $146 million, or 7%, from 2010. In 2010, noninterest income decreased by $81 million, or 4%, compared to 2009. Noninterest income for 2011 decreased $92 million as compared to 2010, when excluding the gain realized from the sale of Tuition Management Systems along with income generated by the business unit during 2010 totaling $54 million. Operating lease income decreased $51 million due to product run off. Deposit service charges decreased $20 million during 2011, reflecting the full year impact of the implementation of Regulation E in the third quarter of 2010. Favorable results from letter of credit and loan fees and net gains from principal investing (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests) were more than offset by declines in trust and investment services income, corporate owned life insurance income, net securities gains, insurance income and investment banking and capital market income. Noninterest income for 2010 increased by $205 million as compared to 2009, when excluding the several significant items that affected noninterest income in 2009. In 2009, these items included net gains of $125 million from repositioning of the securities portfolio, $78 million recorded in connection with the exchange of Common Shares for capital securities, $32 million from the sale of our claim associated with the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy and a $105 million gain from the sale of Visa Inc. shares. As shown in Figure 7, we benefited from a $187 million increase in investment banking and capital market income, $76 million in net gains from loan sales in 2010 compared to a $1 million loss in 2009, and $66 million in net gains from principal investing (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests) in 2010 compared to a $4 million loss in 2009. These favorable results were partially offset by a $79 million decline in net gains on the sale of leased equipment. 49 Table of Contents Figure 7.

Trust and investment services income Trust and investment services are our largest source of noninterest income. The primary components of revenue generated by these services are shown in Figure 8. The 2011 and 2010 decreases of $10 million, or 2%, and $15 million, or 3%, respectively, are primarily attributable to lower fixed income sales reflected in brokerage commissions and institutional asset management and custody fees. The increase in personal asset management and custody fees is largely offset by the impact of outflows in security lending assets and money market mutual funds reflected in institutional asset management and custody fees.

At December 31, 2011, our bank, trust and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management of $51.7 billion, compared to $59.8 billion at December 31, 2010. As shown in Figure 9, the decrease was primarily attributable to reductions in the equity and securities lending portfolios. The decline in the equity portfolio was due in part to asset outflows and market value declines. The decrease in the value of our portfolio of hedge funds is attributable to our second quarter 2009 decision to wind down the operations of Austin (results included in discontinued operations). Our securities lending business has been declining due to our de emphasis of this business resulting in lower transaction volumes, client departures and fewer assets under management. 50 Table of Contents Figure 9.

(b) This figure has been revised from what has previously been disclosed in our earnings release on January 24, 2012. Service charges on deposit accounts The decreases in service charges on deposit accounts in both 2011 and 2010 are primarily due to the implementation of Regulation E pursuant to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978, which went into effect on July 1, 2010 for new clients and August 15, 2010 for our existing clients, partially offset by core deposit account growth. Operating lease income Operating lease income recorded in our Equipment Finance line of business decreased $51 million during 2011 and decreased $54 million in 2010 compared to the prior years due to product run off. Accordingly, as shown in Figure 11, operating lease expense also declined. Investment banking and capital markets income (loss) As shown in Figure 10, income from investment banking and capital markets activities decreased $11 million in 2011. Other investment income increased $15 million from 2010 resulting from gains on sale of certain investments made by our Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services line of business in Key Corporate Bank. Dealer trading and derivative losses increased $6 million from 2010 as a decrease in the provision for losses related to customer derivatives was more than offset by an increase related to credit default swap valuation adjustments. Also impacting this line item was a $24 million charge resulting from Visas late fourth quarter announcement of a planned increase to its litigation escrow deposit. Investment banking income decreased $20 million compared to 2010 due primarily to decreased levels of equity financings and advisor fees. The 2010 increase, as compared to 2009, was driven by lower losses from changes in the fair value of certain commercial real estate related investments totaling $109 million made by our Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services line of business in Key Corporate Bank. We also experienced a $54 million decrease in losses associated with dealer trading and derivatives due largely to a $36 million decrease in the provision for losses related to customer derivatives and a $14 million decrease related to credit default swap valuation adjustments. Investment banking income also increased $29 million due primarily to increased levels of debt and equity financings. 51 Table of Contents Figure 10.

In both years, income related to foreign exchange and interest rate derivative trading was less than $4 million and was offset by losses from our credit portfolio management activities. (b) The allocation between proprietary and non proprietary is made based upon whether the trade is conducted for the benefit of Key or Keys client; rather than based upon the proposed rulemakings under the Volcker Rule. The prohibitions and restrictions on proprietary trading activities contemplated by the Volcker Rule and the rules proposed thereunder are not yet final, and, therefore, the ultimate impact of the rules proposed under the Volcker Rule is not yet known. Fee income or interest income is not included above. Corporate owned life insurance income The $16 million, or 12%, decrease in our 2011 corporate owned life insurance income results primarily from the impact of a nonrecurring $12 million bonus dividend received in 2010. Net gains (losses) from loan sales We sell loans to achieve desired interest rate and credit risk profiles of the overall loan portfolio. Net gains from loan sales remained relatively unchanged during 2011 compared to 2010, while 2009 results were impacted by distressed market conditions. The types of loans sold during 2011 and 2010 are presented in Figure 20. Net gains (losses) from principal investing Principal investments consist of direct and indirect investments in predominantly privately held companies. Our principal investing income is susceptible to volatility since most of it is derived from mezzanine debt and equity investments in small to medium sized businesses. These investments are carried on the balance sheet at fair value ($709 million at December 31, 2011, and $898 million at December 31, 2010). During the first half of 2011, employees who managed our various principal investments formed two independent entities that will serve as investment managers of these investments going forward. Under this arrangement, which was mutually agreeable to both parties, these individuals are no longer employees of Key. As a result of these changes, which were made during the second quarter of 2011, we deconsolidated certain of these direct and indirect investments totaling $234 million. The net gains (losses) presented in Figure 7 derive from changes in fair values as well as sales of principal investments. Noninterest expense As shown in Figure 11, noninterest expense for 2011 was $2.8 billion, down $244 million, or 8%, from 2010. In 2010, noninterest expense declined by $520 million, or 15% from 2009. In 2011, personnel expense increased by $49 million driven by higher levels of incentive compensation. Nonpersonnel expense decreased $293 million due primarily to a $72 million decrease in the FDIC assessment, a $55 million decrease in net OREO expense, a $48 million decrease in operating lease expense due to product run off as well as favorable reductions across several expense categories as a result of our expense management efforts. These favorable results were partially offset by the provision for unfunded commitments which was a credit of $28 million in 2011 compared to a credit of $48 million in 2010. 52 Table of Contents In 2010, personnel expense decreased by $43 million from 2009. Excluding intangible assets impairment charges of $241 million, nonpersonnel expense decreased by $279 million, due primarily to a $53 million decrease in the FDIC deposit insurance assessment, a $53 million decrease in operating lease expense, a $29 million decrease in costs associated with OREO, and a $48 million credit recorded to the provision for losses on lending related commitments recorded during 2010, compared to a $67 million expense recorded for 2009. More information about the intangible assets impairment charges is provided in this section under the heading Intangible assets impairment. Figure 11.

The following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest expense and the factors that caused those elements to change. Personnel As shown in Figure 12, personnel expense, the largest category of our noninterest expense, increased by $49 million, or 3%, in 2011, following a $43 million, or 3%, decline in 2010 from 2009. The 2011 increase was due largely to a $40 million increase in incentive compensation accruals on improved profitability. Employee benefits expense increased $5 million due to increased medical plan expenses. Salaries expense increased $6 million due to higher levels of contract labor as the reduction in the number of average full time equivalent employees offset the impact of base salary increases. Severance expense also increased by $5 million while stock based compensation decreased by $7 million. The 2010 decrease was due largely to a $79 million decrease in our employee benefits expense. The employee benefit expense decrease was caused by a decline in pension expense as a result of amending our cash balance pension plan to freeze future service benefit accruals and the resulting change in certain pension plan assumptions. For more information related to our pension plans, see Note 19 (Employee Benefits). The decrease in employee benefits expense was partially offset by $44 million in increased incentive compensation accruals on improved profitability. 53 Table of Contents Figure 12.

Intangible assets impairment During the third quarter of 2009, we recorded a $45 million charge to write off intangible assets, other than goodwill, associated with actions taken to cease conducting business in certain equipment leasing markets. During the first quarter of 2009, we determined that the estimated fair value of our Key Corporate Bank reporting unit was less than the carrying amount, reflecting continued weakness in the financial markets. As a result, we recorded a pre tax noncash accounting charge of $223 million, of which $27 million related to the discontinued operations of Austin. As a result of this charge, all of the goodwill that had been assigned to Key Corporate Bank has been written off. Operating lease expense The decrease in operating lease expense in both 2011 and 2010 compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to product run off. Income related to the rental of leased equipment is presented in Figure 7 as operating lease income. FDIC Assessment FDIC assessment expense decreased in 2011 as a result of the change in the calculation method for deposit insurance assessments, as discussed in the Deposits and other sources of funds section under the The Dodd Frank Act reform of deposit insurance heading. FDIC assessment expense was unfavorably impacted in 2009 primarily by a one time special assessment recorded in the second quarter of 2009. This increase was partially offset by opting out of the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP), Transaction Account Guarantee (TAG) program effective July 1, 2010. OREO expense Improved liquidity for income producing properties that began in 2010 and carried through into 2011 resulted in a $8 million increase in net gains on sale of OREO in 2011 compared to the year ago while valuation write downs decreased $43 million. OREO expense decreased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily as a result of $7 million in net gains on sale recorded in 2010 compared to net loss on sales of $26 million in 2009. Provision (credit) for losses on lending related commitments The provision for losses on lending related commitments fluctuated during the years shown as a result of variability in underlying credit quality and levels of unfunded commitments. Income taxes We recorded a tax provision from continuing operations of $369 million for 2011, compared to a tax provision of $186 million for 2010 and a tax benefit of $1.035 billion for 2009. The effective tax rate, which is the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes, was 27.4% for 2011, compared to 23.4% for 2010 and 45.0% for 2009. 54 Table of Contents Our federal tax (benefit) expense differs from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate, primarily because we generate income from investments in tax advantaged assets, such as corporate owned life insurance, earn credits associated with investments in low income housing projects and make periodic adjustments to our tax reserves. During 2010, we recorded domestic deferred income tax expense of $32 million as the result of managements change in assertion as to indefinitely reinvesting in non US subsidiaries. In 2009, we recorded a $106 million credit to income taxes, due primarily to the settlement of IRS audits for the tax years 1997 2006. The credit includes a final adjustment of $80 million related to the resolution of certain lease financing tax issues. Line of Business Results This section summarizes the financial performance and related strategic developments of our two major business segments (operating segments), Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank. During the first quarter of 2010, we re aligned our reporting structure for our business segments. Prior to 2010, Consumer Finance consisted mainly of portfolios that were identified as exit or run off portfolios and were included in our Key Corporate Bank segment. Effective for all periods presented, we are reflecting the results of these exit portfolios in Other Segments. The automobile dealer floor plan business, previously included in Consumer Finance, has been realigned with the Commercial Banking line of business within the Key Community Bank segment. In addition, other previously identified exit portfolios included in the Key Corporate Bank segment have been moved to Other Segments. Note 21 (Line of Business Results) describes the products and services offered by each of these business segments, provides more detailed financial information pertaining to the segments and their respective lines of business, and explains Other Segments and Reconciling Items. Figure 13 summarizes the contribution made by each major business segment to our taxable equivalent revenue from continuing operations and income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Key for each of the past three years.

Results for 2009 also include a $32 million ($20 million after tax) gain from the sale of our claim associated with the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy and a $105 million ($65 million after tax) gain from the sale of our remaining equity interest in Visa Inc. 55 Table of Contents Key Community Bank summary of operations As shown in Figure 14, Key Community Bank recorded net income attributable to Key of $213 million for 2011, compared to net income of $155 million for 2010, and a net loss of $68 million for 2009. The increase in 2011 was the result of improvement in the provision for loan and lease losses. Taxable equivalent net interest income declined by $130 million, or 8%, from 2010 as a result of a decline in average deposits, and tighter deposit spreads. Average loans and leases declined by $736 million, or 3%, due to reductions in the commercial and home equity portfolios. Additionally, average deposits declined $1.8 billion, or 4%. A $5.4 billion reduction in CD balances were partially offset by growth in noninterest bearing and NOW accounts, which reflects changes in client preferences and liquidity levels among both consumer and business clients. Additionally, higher priced CDs, originated in prior years, have continued to mature and reprice at prevailing market rates. Noninterest income decreased by $26 million, or 3%, from 2010, due in part to a decline of $16 million in service charges on deposits from the implementation of Regulation E. Insurance income from the bank based brokerage (Key Investment Services) also decreased $11 million which is reflective of the current market and interest rate environment. Letter of credit and loan fees also decreased $3 million from 2010. These declines were partially offset by a $4 million increase in trust and investment services income and increased syndication fees which is representative of continued collaboration with Key Corporate Bank. Government pricing controls, which limited debit card interchange fees, effective October 1, 2011, caused a $15 million fourth quarter decrease in debit card income, confirming our previously reported $50 to $60 million estimated annualized decline to our debit interchange revenue stream. The provision for loan and lease losses declined by $253 million, or 61%, from 2010. Net charge offs have declined $223 million, or 44%, from 2010 as a result of continued progress in the economic environment and further improvement in credit quality of the portfolio. Noninterest expense remained flat compared to 2010. We experienced a $66 million decline in FDIC deposit insurance premiums, which was partially offset by increases in the provision for unfunded commitments, business services and professional fees reflecting the cost of our third party mortgage operations, and increased personnel and real estate costs, which were commensurate with a continued investment in our branch network. Over the last two years, we have built 79 new branches; which net of closures and consolidations resulted in a net addition to our network of 51 branches. In addition, we have renovated approximately 129 branches during this time period. In total, approximately 40% of our branches are either new or have been renovated in the past five years as of our branch modernization initiative. In 2010, the $223 million increase in net income attributable to Key compared to 2009 was due to decreases in the provision for loan and lease losses of $318 million coupled with an increase in noninterest income of $14 million. Taxable equivalent net interest income decreased $104 million, partially offsetting these positive results. Figure 14.

The 2011 improvement was primarily due to an increased credit in the provision for loan and lease losses, as lower taxable equivalent net interest income was offset by improvements in noninterest income and noninterest expense. Taxable equivalent net interest income declined by $93 million, or 12%, in 2011 compared to 2010. This is primarily due to the deposit and borrowing spread, which declined by $79 million, or 28%. This decline was driven by a reduction in the value of deposits resulting from historically low interest rates and the movement of $1.5 billion in escrow balances out of the Real Estate Capital line of business to a third party in the first quarter of 2011. Average earning assets fell by $3.1 billion, or 14%, due primarily to reductions in the real estate loan portfolios; however, strong commercial loan growth in the second half of 2011 resulted in a $483 million increase in period end loans from December 31, 2010. Lower average earning asset balances were offset by improved earning asset yields and an increase in loan related interest fees. Noninterest income increased by $27 million, or 3%, from 2010, due in part to increases of $22 million in letter of credit and loan fees, and $39 million in gains on the disposition of certain investments held by the Real Estate Capital line of business. The growth in noninterest income was offset in part by a $15 million decrease in trust and investment services income related to a reduction in institutional asset management and custody fees and a $25 million decline in operating lease revenue. The Key Corporate Bank provision for loan and lease losses in 2011 was a credit of $198 million compared to a credit of $28 million in 2010, reflecting lower levels of net loan charge offs, and a release of loss reserves due to improved credit quality. Net loan charges offs decreased $469 million from 2010 to $138 million in 2011. Noninterest expense declined by $121 million, or 12%, from 2010, due primarily to net OREO recoveries recorded in 2011 of $5 million versus $46 million in net OREO expense in 2010. Further expense reductions were realized, including a $21 million decline in operating lease expense on product run off, a $55 million decline in other various expense categories, and a $16 million decline in internally allocated overhead and support costs. These reductions were partially offset by a $43 million increase in personnel expense. 57 Table of Contents The 2010 improvement in net income from continuing operations attributable to Key related to a decrease in the provision for loan losses, an increase in noninterest income, and a decrease in noninterest expense, partially offset by a decrease in net interest income. Taxable equivalent net interest income declined by $74 million, or 9% in 2010 compared to 2009 due primarily to decreased earning assets. Noninterest income increased $146 million or 21% driven by fair value adjustments on other real estate investments taken in 2009, and increased investment banking and debt placement fees. The provision for loan and lease losses decreased $1.9 billion on improved credit quality. Noninterest expense decreased $251 million or 20% driven by the decreased provision for lending related commitments, a decrease in intangible amortization expense, decreased miscellaneous expense, and the intangible asset impairment charge taken in 2009.

Other Segments generated net income attributable to Key of $181 million for 2011, compared to net income attributable to Key of less than $1 million for 2010. The 2010 results reflect a $15 million decrease in net interest income and a decrease in the loan loss provision of $278 million offset by various other items. In 2010, Other Segments generated net income attributable to Key of less than $1 million, compared to a net loss attributable to Key of $418 million for 2009.

(c) Excludes loans in the amount of $5.8 billion at December 31, 2011, $6.5 billion at December 31, 2010, $3.5 billion at December 31, 2009, $3.7 billion at December 30, 2008, and $331 million at December 31, 2007, related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business. 59 Table of Contents At December 31, 2011, total loans outstanding were $49.6 billion, compared to $50.1 billion at the end of 2010 and $58.8 billion at the end of 2009. Loans related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business, and excluded from total loans were $5.8 billion at December 31, 2011, $6.5 billion at December 31, 2010, and $3.5 billion at December 31, 2009. Further information regarding our discontinued operations is provided in the section entitled Consumer loan portfolio within this discussion. The decrease in our loans from continuing operations over the past two years reflects reductions in most of our portfolios, with the largest decline experienced in the commercial portfolio. Commercial loan portfolio Commercial loans outstanding were $34.8 billion at December 31, 2011, an increase of $262 million, or 1%, since December 31, 2010. Commercial, financial and agricultural. As shown in Figure 16, our Commercial, Financial and Agricultural loans, also referred to as Commercial and Industrial, represent 39% and 33% of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are the largest component of our total loans. The loans are comprised of fixed and variable rate loans to our large, middle market and small business clients. These loans increased $2.9 billion, or 18%, from one year ago. Commercial real estate loans. Commercial real estate loans represent approximately 19% of our total loan portfolio. These loans include both owner and nonowner occupied properties and constitute approximately 27% of our commercial loan portfolio. As shown in Figure 16, at December 31, 2011, our commercial real estate portfolio included mortgage loans of $8.0 billion and construction loans of $1.3 billion. The total commercial real estate loans for 2011 and 2010 represent 19% and 23%, respectively, of our total loans. Nonowner occupied loans represent 12% of our total loans and owner occupied loans represent 7% of our total loans. The average size of mortgage loans originated during 2011 was $3.8 million, and our largest mortgage loan at December 31, 2011, had a balance of $211 million. At December 31, 2011, our average construction loan commitment was $3.8 million. Our largest construction loan commitment was $56 million at December 31, 2011. Our largest construction loan outstanding was $48.1 million at December 31, 2011. Our commercial real estate lending business is conducted through two primary sources: our 14 state banking franchise, and Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services, a national line of business within Key Corporate Bank that cultivates relationships both within and beyond the branch system. This line of business deals primarily with nonowner occupied properties (generally properties for which at least 50% of the debt service is provided by rental income from nonaffiliated third parties) and accounted for approximately 56% of our average year to date commercial real estate loans during 2011, compared to 60% one year ago. As shown in Figure 17, this loan portfolio is diversified by both property type and geographic location of the underlying collateral. Figure 17 includes commercial mortgage and construction loans in both Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank. 60 Table of Contents Figure 17.

This compares to a decrease of $680 million during 2010. For the period 2008 2010, the secondary market for income property loans was severely constrained. During this period of time, we provided interim financing for certain maturing income property loans. Beginning with the second half of 2010 and continuing throughout 2011, market liquidity for income property loans showed significant improvement. Consequently, our clients need for interim financing has diminished and our portfolio of nonowner occupied income property loans has shown a steady decrease in outstanding principal balances. Since December 31, 2010, our nonowner occupied commercial real estate portfolio has been reduced by approximately $1.8 billion or 23%. As shown in Figure 17, at December 31, 2011, 65% of our commercial real estate loans were for nonowner occupied properties, compared to 68% at December 31, 2010. Approximately 18% and 23% of these loans were construction loans at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Typically, construction properties are not fully leased at the origination of the loan. The borrower relies upon additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide the cash flow necessary to support debt service payments. Uncertain economic conditions generally slow the execution of new leases and may also lead to the turnover of existing leases, driving rental rates and occupancy rates down. As we have experienced during 2011, we expect vacancy rates for retail, office and industrial space to remain elevated and possibly increase well into 2012. Commercial real estate fundamentals appear to be approaching bottom, and certain sectors (e.g., apartments) are showing signs of improvement. According to Property and Portfolio Research, Inc., vacancy fell in the third quarter of 2011 in every major property type, but it remained above year ago levels with the exception of apartments. Rent growth remains flat to negative (again with the exception of apartments), and is at or nearing a trough; however, modest declines are possible over the next year in office, retail, and warehouse property types. Once rents bottom, the anticipated recovery will likely be modest. 61 Table of Contents If the economic recovery stalls, and or job growth continues to disappoint, vacancies will remain elevated and downward pressure on rents and net operating income will remain. The resulting effect would likely be most noticeable in the nonowner occupied properties segment of our commercial real estate loan portfolio, particularly in the retail properties and office buildings components, which comprise 23% of our commercial real estate loans. Commercial property values peaked in the fall of 2007, having experienced increases of approximately 30% since 2005 and 90% since 2001. The most recent Moodys Real Estate Analytics, LLC Commercial Property Price Index (November 2011) showed a 42% drop in values from the peak in October 2007. As of November 2011, the index was at 111.36%, a 13.7% increase from April 2011. April 2011 was the lowest point since the inception of the index in December of 2000. Market averages obscure divergent trends by asset quality and location. Over the past year, competition for the best assets in the top markets has driven prices higher, while weak demand and continued uncertainty is keeping prices for distressed assets low and keeping trends negative. If the factors described above result in further weakening in the fundamentals underlying the commercial real estate market (i.e., vacancy rates, the stability of rental income and asset values), leading to reduced cash flow to support debt service payments, our ability to collect such payments and the strength of our commercial real estate loan portfolio could be adversely affected. Commercial lease financing. We conduct financing arrangements through our Key Equipment Finance line of business and have both the scale and array of products to compete in the equipment lease financing business. Commercial lease financing receivables represented 17% of commercial loans at December 31, 2011, and 19% at December 31, 2010. Commercial loan modification and restructuring Certain commercial loans are modified and extended in the normal course of business for our clients. Loan modifications vary and are handled on a case by case basis with strategies responsive to the specific circumstances of each loan and borrower. In many cases, borrowers have other resources and can reinforce the credit with additional capital, collateral, guarantees or income sources. Modifications are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan credit quality while at the same time meeting our clients financing needs. Modifications made to loans of creditworthy borrowers not experiencing financial difficulties and under circumstances where ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt are not classified as TDRs. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, TDR classification occurs when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a creditor concession has been granted. Our concession types are primarily categorized as interest rate reductions, principal deferral, or forgiveness of principal. Loan extensions are sometimes coupled with these primary concession types. As a result of, improving economic conditions combined with the restructuring of these loans to provide the optimal opportunity for successful repayment by the borrower, we have seen certain of our restructured loans returning to accrual status and consistent performance under the restructured loan terms for each primary type of concession over the past year. For more information on concession types for our commercial accruing and nonaccruing TDRs, see Note 5 (Asset Quality). Figure 18 quantifies restructured loans and TDRs. 62 Table of Contents Figure 18. Commercial TDRs by Note Type and Accrual Status December 31, in millions 2011 2010 Commercial TDRs by Note Type Tranche A $ 206 $ 226 Tranche B 2 14 Total Commercial TDRs (a) $ 208 $ 240 Commercial TDRs by Accrual Status Nonaccruing $ 150 $ 148 Accruing 58 67 Held for sale 25 Total Commercial TDRs (a) $ 208 $ 240 Total Commercial and Consumer TDRs $ 276 $ 297 (a) Prior to 2009, the amounts of TDRs were negligible, and, therefore, we have not included such periods in the figure above. The benefits derived from A B note TDRs are recognized when the underlying assets (predominantly commercial real estate) have been stabilized with a level of leverage supportable by ongoing cash flows. Right sizing the A note to sustainable cash flow should ultimately allow for its return to accrual status and thereupon a resumption of interest income recognition. Similarly, appropriately sized A notes will allow for upgraded credit classification based on rehabilitated credit metrics, including demonstrated payment performance. Other benefits include the borrowers retention of ownership and control of the asset, deleveraged and sustainable capital structure (often sufficient to attract fresh capital into the transaction) and rehabilitation of local markets by minimizing distressed/fire sales. We use an A B note structure for TDRs, breaking the existing loan into two tranches. This approach has many benefits for us and for our borrowers. First, we create an A note. As the objective of this TDR note structure is to achieve a fully performing and well rated A note, we focus on sizing that note to a level that is supported by cash flow available to service debt at current market terms and consistent with our customary underwriting standards. This typically will include a debt coverage ratio of 1.2 or better of cash flow to monthly payments of market interest, and principal amortization of generally not more than 25 years. Appropriately sized A notes are more likely to return to accrual status, allowing us to resume recognizing interest income. As the borrowers payment performance improves, these restructured notes also will allow for upgraded internal quality risk rating classification. Moreover, the borrower retains ownership and control of the underlying collateral (typically, commercial real estate), the borrowers capital structure is strengthened (often to the point that fresh capital is attracted to the transaction), and local markets are spared distressed/fire sales. The B note is typically an interest only note with no required amortization until the property stabilizes and generates excess cash flow. This excess cash flow is customarily applied directly to the principal of the A note. We evaluate the B note when we consider returning the A note to accrual status. In many cases, the B note is charged off at the same time the A note is returned to accrual status. Alternatively, both A and B notes may be simultaneously returned to accrual if credit metrics are supportive. All loans processed as a TDR, including A notes and any non charged off B notes, are reported as TDRs during the calendar year in which the restructure took place. 63 Table of Contents Returning an A note to accrual status requires a reasonable level of certainty that the balance of principal and interest is fully collectable over time. To that end, our policy requires a sustained period of timely principal and interest payments. We evaluate primary repayment derived from property cash flow to assess continued sustainability. Secondary repayment (collateral) is appraised to ensure that market value exceeds the carrying value of the A note with a sufficient excess (generally 20%). Although our policy is a guideline, considerable judgment is required to review each borrowers circumstances. Extensions. Certain commercial loans are modified and extended in the normal course of business for our clients. Project loans are typically refinanced into the permanent commercial loan market at maturity; however, due to the limited sources of permanent commercial mortgage financing available in the market today and the market wide decline in leasing activity and rental rates, an increased number of loans have been extended. Extension terms take into account the specific circumstances of the client relationship, the status of the project and near term prospects for both the client and the collateral. In all cases, pricing and loan structure are reviewed and (where necessary) modified to ensure the loan has been priced to achieve a market rate of return and loan terms (i.e., amortization, covenants and term) that are appropriate for the risk. Typical enhancements include one or more of the following: principal paydown, increased amortization, additional collateral, increased guarantees, and or a cash flow sweep. As previously mentioned, some maturing construction loans have automatic extension options built in and in those cases where the borrower qualifies for the extension option, pricing and loan terms cannot be altered. Most project loans by their nature are collateral dependent as cash flow from the project loans or the sale of the real estate provides for repayment of the loan. Pricing of a loan is determined based on the strength of the borrowing entity and the strength of the guarantor, if any. Therefore, pricing may remain the same (e.g., the loan is already priced at or above current market). We do not consider loan extensions in the normal course of business (under existing loan terms or at market rates) as TDRs, particularly when ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt and no concession has been made. In the case of loan extensions outside of the normal course of business where either collection of all principal and interest is uncertain or a concession has been made we would analyze such credit under the accounting guidance to determine whether it qualifies as a TDR. Extensions that qualify as TDRs are measured for impairment under the applicable accounting guidance. Guarantors. A detailed guarantor analysis is conducted (1) for all new extensions of credit, (2) at the time of any material modification/extension, and (3) typically annually, as part of our on going portfolio and loan monitoring procedures. This analysis includes submission by the guarantor entity of all appropriate financial statements including balance sheets, income statements, tax returns, and real estate schedules. While the specific steps of each guarantor analysis may have some minor differences, the high level objectives include reaching a conclusion regarding the overall financial conditions of the guarantor entities, including: size, quality, and nature of asset base; net worth (adjusted to reflect our opinion of market value); leverage; standing liquidity; recurring cash flow; contingent and direct debt obligations; and near term debt maturities. Borrower and guarantor financial statements are required at least annually within 90 120 days of the calendar/fiscal year end. Income statements and rent rolls for project collateral are required quarterly. In some cases, disclosure of certain information including liquidity, certifications, status of asset sales or debt resolutions, and real estate schedules may be required more frequently. We routinely seek performance from guarantors of impaired debt, if the guarantor is solvent. In limited circumstances, we would not seek to enforce the guaranty, including situations in which we are precluded by bankruptcy and or it is determined the cost to pursue a guarantor exceeds the value to be returned given the guarantors verified financial condition. We are often successful in obtaining either monetary payment and or the cooperation of our solvent guarantors to help mitigate loss, cost and the expense of collections. As of December 31, 2011, we had $119 million of mortgage and construction loans that had a loan to value ratio greater than 1.0, and were accounted for as performing loans. These loans were not considered impaired due to one or 64 Table of Contents more of the following factors: (i) underlying cash flow adequate to service the debt at a market rate of return with adequate amortization; (ii) a satisfactory borrower payment history; and (iii) acceptable guarantor support. Consumer loan portfolio Consumer loans outstanding decreased by $794 million, or 5%, from one year ago. Most of the decrease is attributable to our exit portfolio, as shown in Figure 39 in the Credit risk management section which decreased by $636 million. The home equity portfolio is the largest segment of our consumer loan portfolio. Approximately 95% of this portfolio at December 31, 2011 is derived from our Key Community Bank. The remainder of the portfolio, which has been in an exit mode since the fourth quarter of 2007, was originated from the Consumer Finance line of business and is now included in Other Segments. Home equity loans from our Key Community Bank decreased by $285 million, or 3%, over the past twelve months. Figure 19 summarizes our home equity loan portfolio by source at the end of each of the last five quarters, as well as certain asset quality statistics and yields on the portfolio as a whole. Figure 19.

As previously reported, we have experienced a decrease in our consumer loan portfolio. We expect that the portfolio will continue to decrease in future periods as a result of our actions to exit dealer originated home equity loans and indirect retail lending for marine and recreational vehicle products. We ceased originating new education loans effective December 5, 2009 and account for this business in discontinued operations. In the latter half of 2010, there was public controversy surrounding the foreclosure practices of large home lenders. Our number of home loan foreclosures is small (the average number of new mortgage foreclosures serviced by Key and third parties, initiated per month, through December 31, 2011, was 121; mortgage loans serviced by Key and third parties outstanding at December 31, 2011, were approximately 223,000 loans) and primarily have occurred in our home equity loan portfolio. A review of our foreclosure processes completed in the first quarter of 2011, did not uncover any material defects in the process of signing and notarizing affidavits. Loans held for sale As shown in Note 4 (Loans and Loans Held for Sale), our loans held for sale increased to $728 million at December 31, 2011 from $467 million at December 31, 2010. Loans held for sale related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business, which are excluded from total loans held for sale at December 31, 2010, totaled $15 million. There were no loans held for sale related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business at December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, loans held for sale included $567 million of commercial mortgages which increased by $449 million from December 31, 2010, and $95 million of residential mortgage loans which decreased by $15 65 Table of Contents million from December 31, 2010. In the absence of quoted market prices, we use valuation models to measure the fair value of these loans and adjust the amount recorded on the balance sheet if fair value falls below recorded cost. The models are based on third party data, as well as assumptions related to prepayment speeds, default rates, funding cost, discount rates and other relevant market available inputs. In light of the volatility in the financial markets, we have reviewed our assumptions and determined that they reflect current market conditions. As a result, no significant adjustments to our assumptions were required during 2011. During 2011, we recorded net unrealized losses of $3.2 million and net realized gains of $17 million on our loans held for sale portfolio. These net gains are reported in net gains (losses) from loan sales on the income statement. We have not been significantly impacted by market volatility in the subprime mortgage lending industry, having exited this business in the fourth quarter of 2006. Loan sales As shown in Figure 20, during 2011, we sold $2 billion of commercial real estate loans, $1.4 billion of residential real estate loans, and $118 million of commercial loans. Most of these sales came from the held for sale portfolio. Additionally, there were no education loans sold (included in discontinued assets on the balance sheet), from Figure 20. Due to unfavorable market conditions, we have not securitized any education loans since 2006. Among the factors that we consider in determining which loans to sell are: whether particular lending businesses meet established performance standards or fit with our relationship banking strategy; our A/LM needs; the cost of alternative funding sources; the level of credit risk; capital requirements; and market conditions and pricing. Figure 20 summarizes our loan sales for 2011 and 2010. Figure 20.

(b) We adopted new accounting guidance on January 1, 2010, which required us to consolidate our education loan securitization trusts and resulted in the addition of approximately $2.8 billion of assets, and the same amount of liabilities and equity to our balance sheet. Of this amount, $890 million were included in our net risk weighted assets under current federal banking regulations. In the event of default by a borrower, we are subject to recourse with respect to approximately $891 million of the $100 billion of loans administered or serviced at December 31, 2011. Additional information about this recourse arrangement is included in Note 16 (Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees) under the heading Recourse agreement with FNMA. We derive income from several sources when retaining the right to administer or service loans that are sold. We earn noninterest income (recorded as other income) from fees for servicing or administering loans. This fee income is reduced by the amortization of related servicing assets. In addition, we earn interest income from investing funds generated by escrow deposits collected in connection with the servicing of commercial real estate loans. Additional information about our mortgage servicing assets is included in Note 9 (Mortgage Servicing Assets). Maturities and sensitivity of certain loans to changes in interest rates Figure 22 shows the remaining maturities of certain commercial and real estate loans, and the sensitivity of those loans to changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2011, approximately 33% of these outstanding loans were scheduled to mature within one year. Figure 22.

Securities Our securities portfolio totaled $18 billion at December 31, 2011, compared to $22 billion at December 31, 2010. Available for sale securities were $16 billion at December 31, 2011, compared to $21.9 billion at December 31, 67 Table of Contents 2010, reflecting the liquidity needs arising from changes in our loan and deposit balances and investments in held to maturity securities. Held to maturity securities were $2.1 billion at December 31, 2011, compared to $17 million at December 31, 2010, primarily reflecting increases in agency mortgage backed securities as we continue to prepare for potential future changes in regulatory capital rules. At December 31, 2011, we had $2.1 billion in CMOs in our held to maturity securities portfolio. As shown in Figure 23, all of our mortgage backed securities are issued by government sponsored enterprises or GNMA, and are traded in highly liquid secondary markets and recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. For more information about these securities, see Note 6 (Fair Value Measurements) under the heading Qualitative Disclosures of Valuation Techniques. Figure 23. Mortgage Backed Securities by Issuer December 31, in millions 2011 2010 2009 FHLMC $ 8,984 $ 10,373 $ 7,485 FNMA 5,583 7,357 4,433 GNMA 3,464 4,004 4,516 Total $ 18,031 $ 21,734 $ 16,434 Securities available for sale The majority of our securities available for sale portfolio consists of CMOs, which are debt securities secured by a pool of mortgages or mortgage backed securities. CMOs generate interest income and serve as collateral to support certain pledging agreements. At December 31, 2011, we had $15.9 billion invested in CMOs and other mortgage backed securities in the available for sale portfolio, compared to $21.7 billion at December 31, 2010. During 2011, we had net gains of $124 million from CMOs and other mortgage backed securities, of which $126 million were net unrealized gains and $2 million, were net realized losses. The net unrealized gains resulted from a decrease in market interest rates and were recorded in the AOCI component of shareholders equity. We continue to maintain a moderate asset sensitive interest rate risk position. We periodically evaluate our securities available for sale portfolio in light of established A/LM objectives, changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio, and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed. These evaluations may cause us to take steps to adjust our overall balance sheet positioning. In addition, the size and composition of our securities available for sale portfolio could vary with our needs for liquidity and the extent to which we are required (or elect) to hold these assets as collateral to secure public funds and trust deposits. Although we generally use debt securities for this purpose, other assets, such as securities purchased under resale agreements or letters of credit, are used occasionally when they provide a lower cost of collateral or more favorable risk profiles. Throughout 2011, our investing activities continued to complement other balance sheet developments and provide for our ongoing liquidity management needs. For most of the first half of 2011, we chose not to reinvest the monthly security cash flows and also sold approximately $1.6 billion of CMOs. These actions provided the liquidity necessary to address the funding requirements arising from the loss of certain escrow deposit balances related to commercial mortgage securitizations serviced by Key and rated by Moodys, and also contributed to our preparations for TARP repayment in March 2011. 68 Table of Contents Figure 24 shows the composition, yields and remaining maturities of our securities available for sale.

They include direct investments (investments made in a particular company) as well as indirect investments (investments made through funds that include other investors). Principal investments are predominantly made in privately held companies and are carried at fair value ($709 million at December 31, 2011 and $898 million at December 31, 2010). During the first half of 2011, employees who managed our various principal investments formed two independent entities that will serve as investment managers of these investments going forward. Under this arrangement, which was mutually agreeable to both parties, these individuals are no longer employees of Key. As a result of these changes, which were made during the second quarter of 2011, we deconsolidated certain of these direct and indirect investments, totaling $234 million. In addition to principal investments, other investments include other equity and mezzanine instruments, such as certain real estate related investments that are carried at fair value, as well as other types of investments that generally are carried at cost. Most of our other investments are not traded on an active market. We determine the fair value at which these investments should be recorded based on the nature of the specific investment and all available relevant information. Among other things, our review may encompass such factors as the issuers past financial performance and future potential, the values of public companies in comparable businesses, the risks associated with the particular business or investment type, current market conditions, the nature and duration of resale restrictions, the issuers payment history, our knowledge of the industry and third party data. During 2011, net gains from our principal investing activities (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests) totaled $78 million, which includes $82 million of net unrealized gains. These net gains are recorded as net gains (losses) from principal investing on the income statement. Deposits and other sources of funds Domestic deposits are our primary source of funding. During 2011, these deposits averaged $58.5 billion and represented 80% of the funds we used to support loans and other earning assets, compared to $62.5 billion and 80% during 2010. The composition of our average deposits is shown in Figure 5 in the section entitled Net interest income. The decrease in average domestic deposits during 2011, compared to 2010, was due to a decline in certificates of deposit ($100,000 or more) and other time deposits and was partially offset by an increase in NOW and money market deposit accounts, and noninterest bearing deposits. The mix of deposits continues to change as higher costing certificates of deposit mature and re price to current market rates and clients move their balances to transaction and nonmaturity deposit accounts, such as NOW and money market savings accounts, or look for other alternatives for investing in the current low rate environment. Approximately $6.8 billion of our certificates of deposit outstanding at December 31, 2011, mature over the next four quarters, and included in these totals are approximately $2.5 billion of higher costing certificates of deposit originated prior to 2009. The maturities of these certificates of deposit are as follows: $238 million at a 4.95% cost mature in the first quarter of 2012, $688 million at a 4.57% cost mature in the second quarter of 2012, $1 billion at a 5.06% cost mature in the third quarter of 2012, and $529 million at a 4.88% cost mature in the fourth quarter of 2012. These re pricing opportunities will benefit our net interest margin. Wholesale funds, consisting of deposits in our foreign office and short term borrowings, averaged $3.4 billion during 2011, compared to $3.5 billion during 2010. The change from 2010 resulted from a $119 million decrease in foreign office deposits, a $63 million decrease in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and was partially offset by a $74 million increase in bank notes and other short term borrowings. 70 Table of Contents On January 11, 2012, we signed a purchase and assumption agreement to acquire 37 retail branches in Buffalo and Rochester, NY. The deposits associated with these branches total approximately $2.4 billion, while loans total approximately $400 million. We plan to use this excess liquidity to fund debt maturities and loan growth. The transaction is expected to close in late second or early third quarter of 2012. At December 31, 2011, Key had $4.7 billion in time deposits of $100,000 or more. Figure 26 shows the maturity distribution of these deposits. Figure 26.

Accordingly, since the beginning of 2011, KeyBank again offered noninterest bearing demand transaction accounts, with unlimited FDIC deposit insurance, similar to when it participated in the TAG program. Capital At December 31, 2011, our shareholders equity was $9.9 billion, down $1.2 billion from December 31, 2010. The following discusses certain factors that contributed to the decline. For other factors that contributed to the change, see the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity. As previously reported, on January 1, 2010, we adopted new consolidation accounting guidance which required us to consolidate our education loan securitization trusts (classified as discontinued assets and liabilities). As a result, we consolidated our education loan securitization trusts and made a corresponding $45 million cumulative effect adjustment. That consolidation added $2.8 billion in discontinued assets, and the same amount of liabilities and equity to our balance sheet; loans constituted $2.6 billion of the assets. During the third quarter of 2011, we determined that the $45 million cumulative effect adjustment made related to the consolidation of these trusts on January 1, 2010 was incorrect. Further information regarding this error and its correction is provided in Note 13 (Acquisition, Divestiture and Discontinued Operations). Comprehensive capital assessment review and redemption notices for certain capital securities On January 9, 2012, we submitted to the Federal Reserve and provided to the OCC under the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review process our 2012 2013 Comprehensive Capital Plan. We are currently awaiting the results of this review. On June 10, 2011, we submitted to the Federal Reserve and provided to the OCC an updated Comprehensive Capital Plan, which set forth additional capital actions related to redemptions of certain outstanding capital securities. On August 1, 2011, the Federal Reserve informed us that it had no objections to the capital actions set forth in our updated capital plan. 71 Table of Contents In August 2011, KeyCorp repurchased $22.6 million of capital securities issued by KeyCorp Capital VII. On September 1, 2011, KeyCorp fully redeemed the following capital securities: KeyCorp Capital V, KeyCorp Capital VI, KeyCorp Capital VIII, and Union State Capital I. During the fourth quarter of 2011, capital securities issued by Union State Statutory Trust II and Union State Statutory Trust IV were redeemed on October 31, 2011 and October 7, 2011, respectively. On October 31, 2011, KeyCorp submitted notice to the property trustee for the redemption in full of the capital securities issued by KeyCorp Capital IX; such capital securities were redeemed on December 15, 2011. Provisions of the Dodd Frank Act provide for the phase out of Tier 1 capital treatment for capital securities beginning in 2013. As a result, the outstanding capital securities will eventually become Tier 2 capital. Management continues to evaluate its options with respect to the remaining outstanding capital securities. A notice of proposed rulemaking related to the implementation of Basel III, which is expected to be published in the first half of 2012. This proposal is expected to include the phase out of trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital treatment. Repurchase of TARP CPP preferred stock, warrant and completion of equity and debt offerings As previously reported, Key completed the repurchase of the $2.5 billion of Series B Preferred Stock and corresponding warrant issued to the U.S. Treasury Department. As a result of the repurchase, we recorded a $49 million one time deemed dividend in the first quarter of 2011 related to the remaining difference between the repurchase price and the carrying value of the preferred shares at the time of repurchase. Beginning with the second quarter of 2011, the repurchase resulted in the elimination of quarterly dividends of $31 million and discount amortization of $4 million, or $140 million on an annual basis, related to these preferred shares. In total, Key paid $2.867 billion to the U.S. Treasury during the investment period in the form of dividends, principal and repurchase of the warrant, resulting in a return to the U.S. Treasury of $367 million above the initial investment of $2.5 billion on November 14, 2008. Dividends During the first quarter of 2011, we made dividend payments of $31 million to the U.S. Treasury on the Series B Preferred Stock as a participant in the U.S. Treasurys TARP CPP. The repurchase of this Preferred Stock in March 2011 eliminated future quarterly dividends of $31 million, or $125 million on an annual basis. Also in 2011, we made four quarterly dividend payments of $1.9375 per share or $6 million on our Series A Preferred Stock. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2011, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $.03 per Common Share or $.12 on an annualized basis. We made one quarterly dividend payments of $.01 per share, or $9 million, and three quarterly dividend payments of $.03 per share, or $28 million, on our Common Shares during 2011. Common Shares outstanding Our Common Shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol KEY with 33,873 holders of record of our Common Shares at December 31, 2011. Our book value per Common Share was $10.09 based on 953.0 million shares outstanding at December 31, 2011, compared to $9.52 based on 880.6 million shares outstanding at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011 our tangible book value per Common Share was $9.11 compared to $8.45 at December 31, 2010. Figure 44 in the section entitled Fourth Quarter Results shows the market price ranges of our Common Shares, per Common Share earnings and dividends paid by quarter for each of the last two years. Figure 27 compares the price performance of our Common Shares (based on an initial investment of $100 on December 31, 2006, and assuming reinvestment of dividends) with that of the Standard & Poors 500 Index and a 72 Table of Contents group of other banks that constitute our peer group. The peer group consists of the banks that make up the Standard & Poors 500 Regional Bank Index and the banks that make up the Standard & Poors 500 Diversified Bank Index. We are included in the Standard & Poors 500 Index and the peer group. Figure 27.

During 2011, shares previously issued in conjunction with our employee benefit plans were returned to us. Going forward we expect to reissue treasury shares as needed in connection with stock based compensation awards and for other corporate purposes. In the past, we have periodically repurchased Common Shares in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions under a repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors. The program does not have an expiration date, and we have outstanding Board authority to repurchase 13.9 million shares. We did not repurchase any Common Shares during all of 2011 or 2010 other that the shares acquired from employees in connection with our stock compensation plan. As discussed in further detail in Supervision and Regulation in Item 1, Part I of this report, we are required to annually submit a capital plan to the Federal Reserve setting forth capital actions, including any share repurchases our Board of Directors and management may propose to make during the year. Pursuant to that requirement, we have submitted our capital plan for review to the Federal Reserve that contemplates, among other uses of our capital, potential share repurchases in 2012. 2011 Capital plan and proposed actions As part of its ongoing supervisory process, the Federal Reserve requires a BHC to submit an annual Comprehensive Capital Plan as well as to update such plan to reflect material changes in a firms risk profile, business strategies, or corporate structure, including but not limited to changes in planned capital actions. On January 7, 2011, we submitted our 2011 2012 Comprehensive Capital Plan to the Federal Reserve. On March 18, 2011, the Federal Reserve informed us that it had no objection to our Comprehensive Capital Plan following its Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). On June 10, 2011, we submitted to the Federal Reserve 73 Table of Contents and provided to the OCC an updated Comprehensive Capital Plan, which set forth additional capital actions related to redemptions of certain outstanding capital securities. On August 1, 2011, the Federal Reserve informed us that it had no objections to the capital actions set forth in our updated capital plan. Capital adequacy Capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance. All of our capital ratios remain in excess of regulatory requirements at December 31, 2011. Our capital and liquidity are intended to position us well to weather an adverse credit cycle while continuing to serve our clients needs, as well as to adjust to the application of any new regulatory capital standards expected to be promulgated under the Dodd Frank Act or due to Basel III. Our shareholders equity to assets ratio was 11.16% at December 31, 2011, compared to 12.10% at December 31, 2010. Our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 9.88% at December 31, 2011, compared to 8.19% at December 31, 2010. Banking industry regulators prescribe minimum capital ratios for bank holding companies and their banking subsidiaries. Risk based capital guidelines require a minimum level of capital as a percent of risk weighted assets. Risk weighted assets consist of total assets plus certain off balance sheet and market items, subject to adjustment for predefined credit risk factors. Currently, banks and bank holding companies must maintain, at a minimum, Tier 1 capital as a percent of risk weighted assets of 4.00% and total capital as a percent of risk weighted assets of 8.00%. We expect U.S. regulators to introduce new regulatory capital guidelines in 2012, responding to both the Dodd Frank Act and Basel III capital directives. As of December 31, 2011, our Tier 1 risk based capital ratio and our total risk based capital ratios were 12.99% and 16.51%, respectively, compared to 15.16% and 19.12%, respectively, at December 31, 2010. Another indicator of capital adequacy, the leverage ratio, is defined as Tier 1 capital as a percentage of average quarterly tangible assets. Bank holding companies that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the Federal Reserves risk adjusted measure for market risk as we have must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 3.00%. All other bank holding companies must maintain a minimum ratio of 4.00%. As of December 31, 2011, our leverage ratio was 11.79% compared to 13.02% at December 31, 2010. The enactment of the Dodd Frank Act changes the regulatory capital standards that apply to bank holding companies by requiring regulators to create rules phasing out the treatment of capital securities and cumulative preferred securities being eligible Tier 1 risk based capital. This three year phase out period, which commences January 1, 2013, will ultimately result in our capital securities issued by the KeyCorp capital trusts (capital securities) being treated only as Tier 2 capital. These changes in effect apply the same leverage and risk based capital requirements that apply to depository institutions to BHCs, savings and loan holding companies, and nonbank financial companies identified as systemically important. As of December 31, 2011, our Tier 1 risk based capital ratio, leverage ratio, and total risk based capital ratio were 12.99%, 11.79%, and 16.51%, respectively. The capital securities issued by the KeyCorp capital trusts contribute $1.2 billion or 136, 123, and 136 basis points to our Tier 1 risk based capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, and total risk based capital ratio, respectively, as of December 31, 2011. Federal bank regulators group FDIC insured depository institutions into five categories, ranging from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized. A well capitalized institution must meet or exceed the prescribed thresholds of 6.00% for Tier 1 risk based capital, 5.00% for Tier 1 leverage capital, and 10.00% for total risk based capital and must not be subject to any written agreement, order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. If these provisions applied to bank holding companies, we would qualify as well capitalized at December 31, 2011. We believe there has not been any change in condition or event since that date that would cause our capital classification to change. Analysis on a pro forma basis, accounting for the phase out of our capital securities as Tier 1 eligible (and therefore as Tier 2 instead) as of December 31, 2011, also determines that we would qualify as well capitalized under current regulatory guidelines, with the pro forma Tier 1 risk based capital ratio, pro forma leverage ratio, and pro forma total risk based capital ratio being 74 Table of Contents 11.64%, 10.56%, and 16.51%, respectively. The current regulatory defined categories serve a limited supervisory function. Investors should not use our pro forma ratios as a representation of our overall financial condition or prospects of KeyCorp or KeyBank. A discussion of the regulatory capital standards and other related capital adequacy regulatory standards is included in Item 1 in the Supervision and Regulation section. Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company capital adequacy based on both the amount and composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. As a result of the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has intensified its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of Tier 1 risk based capital, known as Tier 1 common equity, and its review of the consolidated capitalization of systemically important financial companies, including KeyCorp. The capital modifications mandated by the Dodd Frank Act and set forth in Basel III, which the Federal Reserve intends to implement in the near term, are consistent with the renewed focus on Tier 1 common equity and the consolidated capitalization of banks, BHCs, and covered nonbank financial companies, which resulted from the financial crisis and, therefore, Tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by GAAP nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations, this measure is considered to be a non GAAP financial measure. Figure 4 in the Highlights of Our Performance section reconciles Key shareholders equity, the GAAP performance measure, to Tier 1 common equity, the corresponding non GAAP measure. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio was 11.26% at December 31, 2011, compared to 9.34% at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011, we had a consolidated federal net deferred tax asset of $60 million and a state deferred tax liability of $24 million compared to combined net federal and state deferred tax assets of $442 million at December 31, 2010. Prior to the third quarter of 2009, we had been in a net deferred tax liability position. Generally, for risk based capital purposes, deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income are limited to the lesser of: (i) the amount of deferred tax assets that a financial institution expects to realize within one year of the calendar quarter end date, based on its projected future taxable income for the year, or (ii) 10% of the amount of an institutions Tier 1 capital. Based on these restrictions, at December 31, 2011, we had no net deferred tax assets deducted from Tier 1 capital and risk weighted assets compared to $158 million at December 31, 2010. We anticipate that we will not have a net deferred tax asset disallowed for risk based capital purposes as we believe we will be in a net deferred tax liability position in the coming quarters. Basel III In December 2010, the Basel Committee released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation (Basel III). Basel III is a comprehensive set of reform measures designed to strengthen the regulation, supervision and risk management of the banking sector, and introduces for the first time an official definition and guideline for Tier 1 common equity. Beginning on January 1, 2013, banks with regulators adopting the Basel III capital framework in full would be required to meet the following minimum capital ratios 3.5% common equity Tier 1 to risk weighted assets, 4.5% Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets, and 8.0% total capital to risk weighted assets. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer will begin on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% and be phased in over a four year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019). When the requirements for the fully phased in capital conservation buffer are included, the resulting minimum levels for Tier 1 capital and total risk based capital will be higher than the U.S.s current well capitalized minimums. A more thorough discussion of Basel III is included in Item 1 Supervision and Regulation section of this report, including a discussion of the fully phased in requirements at January 1, 2019. Given our strong capital position, we expect to be able to satisfy the Basel III capital framework when U.S. capital regulations corresponding to it are finalized. While we also have a strong liquidity position, the Basel III liquidity framework could require us and other U.S. banks to initiate additional liquidity management initiatives, including adding additional liquid assets, issuing term debt, and modifying our product pricing for loans, commitments, and deposits. U.S. regulators have indicated that they may elect to make certain refinements to the Basel III liquidity framework. Accordingly, at this point it is premature to assess the impact of the Basel III liquidity framework. Accordingly, a notice of proposed rulemaking relating to the U.S. implementation of the Basel III liquidity framework is expected in the first half of 2012. 75 Table of Contents Figure 29 represents the details of our regulatory capital position at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 under the existing Basel I standards.

(b) Other assets deducted from Tier 1 capital and risk weighted assets consist of disallowed deferred tax assets of $158 million at December 31, 2010, disallowed intangible assets (excluding goodwill) and deductible portions of nonfinancial equity investments. There were no disallowed deferred tax assets at December 31, 2011. (c) The allowance for loan and lease losses included in Tier 2 capital is limited by regulation to 1.25% of the sum of gross risk weighted assets plus low level exposures and residual interests calculated under the direct reduction method, as defined by the Federal Reserve. The excess allowance for loan and lease losses includes $104 million and $114 million at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, of allowance classified as discontinued assets on the balance sheet. (d) This ratio is Tier 1 capital divided by average quarterly total assets as defined by the Federal Reserve less: (i) goodwill, (ii) the disallowed intangible assets described in footnote (b), and (iii) deductible portions of nonfinancial equity investments; plus assets derecognized as an offset to AOCI resulting from the adoption and subsequent application of the applicable accounting guidance for defined benefit and other postretirement plans. 76 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations Off balance sheet arrangements We are party to various types of off balance sheet arrangements, which could lead to contingent liabilities or risks of loss that are not reflected on the balance sheet. Variable interest entities A VIE is a partnership, limited liability company, trust or other legal entity that meets any one of the following criteria: The entity does not have sufficient equity to conduct its activities without additional subordinated financial support from another party. The entitys investors lack the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance. The entitys equity at risk holders do not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive residual returns. The voting rights of some investors are not proportional to their economic interests in the entity, and substantially all of the entitys activities involve, or are conducted on behalf of, investors with disproportionately few voting rights. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for consolidations, we consolidate a VIE if we have: (i) a variable interest in the entity; (ii) the power to direct activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance; and (iii) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE (i.e., we are considered to be the primary beneficiary). Additional information regarding the nature of VIEs and our involvement with them is included in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) under the heading Basis of Presentation and in Note 11 (Variable Interest Entities). We use the equity method to account for unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or VIEs if we have significant influence over the entitys operating and financing decisions (usually defined as a voting or economic interest of 20% to 50%, but not controlling). Unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or VIEs in which we have a voting or economic interest of less than 20% generally are carried at cost. Investments held by our registered broker dealer and investment company subsidiaries (primarily principal investments) are carried at fair value. Commitments to extend credit or funding Loan commitments provide for financing on predetermined terms as long as the client continues to meet specified criteria. These commitments generally carry variable rates of interest and have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. We typically charge a fee for our loan commitments. Since a commitment may expire without resulting in a loan or being fully utilized, the total amount of an outstanding commitment may significantly exceed any related cash outlay. Further information about our loan commitments at December 31, 2011, is presented in Note 16 (Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees) under the heading Commitments to Extend Credit or Funding. Figure 30 shows the remaining contractual amount of each class of commitment to extend credit or funding. For loan commitments and commercial letters of credit, this amount represents our maximum possible accounting loss if the borrower were to draw upon the full amount of the commitment and then default on payment for the total amount of the then outstanding loan. 77 Table of Contents Other off balance sheet arrangements Other off balance sheet arrangements include financial instruments that do not meet the definition of a guarantee in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, and other relationships, such as liquidity support provided to asset backed commercial paper conduits, indemnification agreements and intercompany guarantees. Information about such arrangements is provided in Note 16 under the heading Other Off Balance Sheet Risk. Contractual obligations Figure 30 summarizes our significant contractual obligations, and lending related and other off balance sheet commitments at December 31, 2011, by the specific time periods in which related payments are due or commitments expire.

Guarantees We are a guarantor in various agreements with third parties. As guarantor, we may be contingently liable to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in a specified interest rate, foreign exchange rate or other variable (including the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a specified event). These variables, known as 78 Table of Contents underlyings, may be related to an asset or liability, or another entitys failure to perform under a contract. Additional information regarding these types of arrangements is presented in Note 16 under the heading Guarantees. Risk Management Overview Like all financial services companies, we engage in business activities and assume the related risks. The most significant risks we face are credit, liquidity, market, compliance, operational, strategic and reputation risks. We must properly and effectively identify, assess, measure, monitor, control and report such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability. Certain of these risks are defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this section. Our ERM Committee, which consists of the Chief Executive Officer and other Senior Executives, is responsible for managing risk and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite. The ERM Program encompasses our risk philosophy, policy, framework and governance structure for the management of risks across the entire company. The ERM Committee reports to the Risk Management Committee of our Board of Directors. Annually, the Board of Directors reviews and approves the ERM Program, as well as the risk appetite and corporate risk tolerances for major risk categories. We use a risk adjusted capital framework to manage risks. This framework is approved and managed by the ERM Committee. Our Board of Directors serves in an oversight capacity with the objective of managing our enterprise wide risks in a manner that is effective, balanced and adds value for the shareholders. The Board inquires about risk practices, reviews the portfolio of risks, compares actual risks to the risk appetite and tolerances, and receives regular reports about significant risks both actual and emerging. To assist in these efforts, the Board has delegated primary oversight responsibility for risk to the Audit Committee and the Risk Management Committee. The Audit Committee has oversight responsibility for internal audit; financial reporting; compliance risk and legal matters; the implementation, management and evaluation of operational risk and controls; information security and fraud risk. The Audit Committee also is responsible for evaluating the qualifications and independence of the independent auditors. The Audit Committee discusses policies related to risk assessment and risk management and the processes related to risk review and compliance. The Risk Management Committee has responsibility for overseeing the management of credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk, including the actions taken to mitigate these risks, as well as reputational and strategic risks. The Risk Management Committee also oversees the maintenance of appropriate regulatory and economic capital, reviews the ERM reports, and approves any material changes to the charter of the ERM Committee. The Audit and Risk Management Committees meet jointly, as appropriate, to discuss matters that relate to each committees responsibilities. In addition to regularly scheduled bi monthly meetings, the Audit Committee convenes to discuss the content of our financial disclosures and quarterly earnings releases. Committee chairpersons routinely meet with management during interim months to plan agendas for upcoming meetings and to discuss emerging trends and events that have transpired since the preceding meeting. All members of the Board receive formal reports designed to keep them abreast of significant developments during the interim months. Federal banking regulators are reemphasizing with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution. We believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks, and comport with regulatory expectations. 79 Table of Contents Market risk management The cash flows and values of financial instruments change as a function of changes in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and other market factors that influence prospective yields, values or prices associated with the instrument. For example, the value of a fixed rate bond will decline if market interest rates increase, while the cash flows associated with a variable rate loan will increase when interest rates increase. The holder of a financial instrument is exposed to market risk when the cash flows or value of the instrument is tied to such external factors. Most of our market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations. Interest rate risk management Interest rate risk, which is inherent in the banking industry, is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the EVE. Such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates, and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. We manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the EVE in accordance with our risk appetite, and within policy limits established by the ERM Committee. Interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of consumer preferences for loan and deposit products, economic conditions, the competitive environment within our markets and changes in market interest rates that affect client activity and our hedging, investing, funding and capital positions. The primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of gap risk, basis risk, yield curve risk and option risk. Gap risk is the exposure to changes in interest rates and occurs when the volume of interest bearing liabilities and the volume of interest earning assets they fund (for example, deposits used to fund loans) do not mature or reprice at the same time. Basis risk is the exposure to asymmetrical changes in interest rate indexes and occurs when floating rate assets and floating rate liabilities reprice at the same time, but in response to different market factors or indices. Yield curve risk is the exposure to non parallel changes in the slope of the yield curve (where the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity) and occurs when interest bearing liabilities and the interest earning assets they fund do not price or reprice to the same term point on the yield curve. Option risk is the exposure to a customer or counterpartys ability to take advantage of the interest rate environment and terminate or reprice one of our assets, liabilities or off balance sheet instruments prior to contractual maturity without a penalty. Option risk occurs when exposures to customer and counterparty early withdrawals or early prepayments are not mitigated with an offsetting position or appropriate compensation. Net interest income simulation analysis. The primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis. For purposes of this analysis, we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on and off balance sheet positions accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity. The analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments, including a most likely macro economic scenario. Simulation modeling assumes that residual risk exposures will be managed to within the risk appetite. Typically, the amount of net interest income at risk is measured by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if the federal funds target rate were to gradually increase or decrease by 200 basis points over 80 Table of Contents the next twelve months, and term rates were to move in a similar fashion. In light of the low interest rate environment, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, we modified the standard rate scenario of a gradual decrease of 200 basis points over twelve months to a gradual decrease of 25 basis points over two months with no change over the following ten months. After calculating the amount of net interest income at risk to interest rate changes, we compare that amount with the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment. We also perform regular stress tests and sensitivities on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments. One set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of interest rate inputs on simulated exposures. Assessments are performed using different shapes of the yield curve, including a sustained flat yield curve, an inverted slope yield curve, changes in credit spreads, an immediate parallel change in market interest rates and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates. Another set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of loan and deposit assumptions and assumed discretionary strategies on simulated exposures. Assessments are performed on changes to the following assumptions: the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities, changes in lending spreads, prepayments on loans and securities, other loan and deposit balance shifts, investment, funding and hedging activities, and liquidity and capital management strategies. Simulation analysis produces only a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on judgments related to assumption inputs into the simulation model. We tailor assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled, and validate those assumptions on a regular basis. Our simulations are performed with the assumption that interest rate risk positions will be actively managed through the use of on and off balance sheet financial instruments to achieve the desired residual risk profile. However, actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition, customer behavior, product pricing, market interest rates, investment, funding and hedging activities, and repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events. Figure 31 presents the results of the simulation analysis at December 31, 2011 and 2010. At December 31, 2011, our simulated exposure to a change in short term interest rates was moderately asset sensitive. ALCO policy limits for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual increase or decrease in short term interest rates over the next twelve months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 4%. As shown in Figure 31, we are operating within these limits. Figure 31. Simulated Change in Net Interest Income December 31, 2011 Basis point change assumption (short term rates) 25 +200 ALCO policy limits 4.00 % 4.00 % Interest rate risk assessment .51 % 2.35 % December 31, 2010 Basis point change assumption (short term rates) 25 +200 ALCO policy limits 4.00 % 4.00 % Interest rate risk assessment .74 % 2.99 % As interest rates have remained at low levels for an extended period of time, we have gradually shifted from a liability sensitive position to an asset sensitive position as a result of balance growth in transaction deposits and declines in loan balances. As the Federal Reserves FOMC has indicated that it anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014, we continue to invest available funds and execute hedges to moderate further increases in the asset sensitive position. These activities will continue to recognize the shift in the mix and maturity of customer deposits. Our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume, mix, maturity and re pricing characteristics of 81 Table of Contents loan and deposit flows. As changes occur to the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy, management evaluates hedging opportunities that would change the reported interest rate risk profile. The results of additional simulation analyses that make use of alternative interest rate paths and customer behavior assumptions indicate that net interest income improvement in a rising rate environment could be diminished, and actual results may be different than the policy simulation results in Figure 31. Net interest income improvements are highly dependent on the timing, magnitude, frequency and path of interest rate increases and assumption inputs for deposit re pricing relationships, lending spreads and the balance behavior of transaction accounts. We also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a three year horizon. These simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a twelve month horizon. To capture longer term exposures, we calculate exposures to changes to the EVE as discussed in the following section. Economic value of equity modeling. EVE complements net interest income simulation analysis since it estimates risk exposure beyond twelve , twenty four and thirty six month horizons. EVE measures the extent to which the economic values of assets, liabilities and off balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. EVE is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates, and measuring the resulting change in the values of assets and liabilities under multiple interest rate paths. Under the current level of market interest rates, the calculation of EVE under an immediate 200 basis point decrease in interest rates results in certain interest rates declining to zero and a less than 200 basis point decrease in certain yield curve term points. This analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities. Those assumptions are based on historical behaviors, as well as our expectations. We develop remediation plans that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our EVE will decrease by more than 15% in response to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates. We are operating within these guidelines. Management of interest rate exposure. We use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate A/LM strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures. Specifically, we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities, issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates, and using derivatives predominantly in the form of interest rate swaps, which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities. Figure 32 shows all swap positions that we hold for A/LM purposes. These positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed upon amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index. For example, fixed rate debt is converted to a floating rate through a receive fixed/pay variable interest rate swap. The volume, maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader A/LM objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. For more information about how we use interest rate swaps to manage our risk profile, see Note 8 (Derivatives and Hedging Activities). Figure 32.

We use a VAR simulation model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and credit spreads on the fair value of this portfolio. Using two years of historical information, the model estimates the maximum potential one day loss with a 95% confidence level. Statistically, this means that losses will exceed VAR, on average, five out of 100 trading days, or three to four times each quarter. We manage exposure to market risk in accordance with VAR limits for trading activity that have been approved by the Market Risk Committee which was established as part of our ERM Program. At December 31, 2011, the aggregate one day trading limit set by the committee was $5.5 million. We are operating within these constraints. During 2011, our aggregate daily average, minimum and maximum VAR amounts were $1.7 million, $1.2 million and $2 million, respectively. In 2010, our aggregate daily average, minimum and maximum VAR amounts were $1.8 million, $1.2 million and $2.5 million, respectively. In addition to comparing VAR exposure against limits on a daily basis, we monitor loss limits, use sensitivity measures and conduct stress tests. We report our market risk exposure to the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors. Liquidity risk management We define liquidity as the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences. Liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned, as well as unanticipated, changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions. Governance structure We manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated basis. This approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity, as well as each entitys capacity to manage through adverse conditions. The approach also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to sufficient wholesale funding. Oversight of the liquidity risk management process is governed by the Risk Management Committee of the KeyCorp Board of Directors, the KeyBank Board of Directors, the ERM Committee and the ALCO. These groups regularly review various liquidity reports, including liquidity and funding summaries, liquidity trends, peer comparisons, variance analyses, liquidity projections, hypothetical funding erosion stress tests and goal tracking reports. The reviews generate a discussion of positions, trends and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of the decisions that we make. When liquidity pressure is elevated, positions are monitored more closely and reporting is more intensive. We communicate with individuals within and outside of the company on a daily basis to discuss emerging issues. In addition, we use a variety of daily liquidity reports to monitor the flow of funds. Factors affecting liquidity Our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events. An example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency. Examples of indirect events (events unrelated to us) that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war, natural disasters, political events, or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation, mutual fund or hedge fund. Similarly, market speculation, or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources. 83 Table of Contents During the first quarter of 2011, Moodys (a credit rating agency that rates KeyCorp and KeyBank debt securities) indicated to KeyBank that certain escrow deposits associated with our mortgage servicing operations had to be moved to another financial institution which meets Moodys minimum ratings threshold. As a result of this decision by Moodys, on March 7, 2011, KeyBank transferred approximately $1.5 billion of these escrow deposit balances to an acceptably rated institution which resulted in an immaterial impairment of the related mortgage servicing assets. KeyBank had ample liquidity reserves to offset the loss of these deposits. Managing liquidity risk We regularly monitor our funding sources and measure our capacity to obtain funds in a variety of scenarios in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable funding. In the normal course of business, we perform a monthly hypothetical funding erosion stress test for both KeyCorp and KeyBank. In a heightened monitoring mode, we may conduct the hypothetical funding erosion stress tests more frequently, and use assumptions so the stress tests are more strenuous and reflect the changed market environment. Our testing incorporates estimates for loan and deposit lives based on our historical studies. Erosion stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods. Ultimately, they determine the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations. To compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures, we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed. At December 31, 2011, we have no secured borrowings outstanding. However, we retain the capacity to utilize secured borrowings as a contingent funding source. We maintain a Contingency Funding Plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis. The Plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions. It also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for managing liquidity through a problem period. As part of the Plan, we maintain a liquidity reserve through balances in our liquid asset portfolio. During a problem period, that reserve could be used as a source of funding to provide time to develop and execute a longer term strategy. The liquid asset portfolio at December 31, 2011 totaled $11.2 billion, consisting of $6.4 billion of unpledged securities, $1.9 billion of securities available for secured funding at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati and $2.9 billion of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our Federal Reserve account. The liquid asset portfolio can fluctuate over time due to excess liquidity, heightened risk, or prefunding of expected outflows, such as debt maturities. Additionally, as of December 31, 2011, our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was $12.3 billion at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and $4.5 billion at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati. Long term liquidity strategy Our long term liquidity strategy is to be predominantly funded by core deposits. However, wholesale funds may be used to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio, meet daily cash demands, and allow management flexibility to execute business initiatives. Keys client based relationship strategy provides for a strong core deposit base which, in conjunction with intermediate and long term wholesale funds managed to a diversified maturity structure and investor base, supports our liquidity risk management strategy. We use the loan to deposit ratio as a metric to monitor these strategies. Our target loan to deposit ratio is 90 100% (at December 31, 2011 our loan to deposit ratio was 87%), which we calculate as total loans, loans held for sale, and nonsecuritized discontinued loans divided by domestic deposits. Sources of liquidity Our primary sources of funding include customer deposits, wholesale funding, liquid assets, and capital. If the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances, we rely on 84 Table of Contents wholesale funding or liquid assets. Conversely, excess cash generated by operating, investing and deposit gathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets. We actively manage liquidity using a variety of nondeposit sources, including short and long term debt, and secured borrowings. Liquidity programs We have several liquidity programs, which are described in Note 15 (Long Term Debt), that enable the parent company and KeyBank to raise funds in the public and private markets when the capital markets are functioning normally. The proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. Each of the programs is replaced or renewed as needed. There are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs. Liquidity for KeyCorp The parent company has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt; support customary corporate operations and activities (including acquisitions) and occasional guarantees of subsidiaries obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences; and pay dividends to shareholders. Our primary tools for assessing parent company liquidity is the net short term cash position, which measures the ability to fund debt maturing in 24 months or less with existing liquid assets, and a cash coverage metric, which measures the ability to meet all projected obligations over 12 months. Another key measure of parent company liquidity is the liquidity gap, which represents the difference between projected liquid assets and anticipated financial obligations over several time horizons. We generally rely upon the issuance of term debt to manage the liquidity gap within targeted ranges assigned to various time periods. At December 31, 2011, the parent company held $2.1 billion in short term investments, which we project to be sufficient to meet our projected obligations including the repayment our maturing debt obligations for the periods prescribed by our policies. Typically, the parent company meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from KeyBank. Federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval. A national banks dividend paying capacity is affected by several factors, including net profits (as defined by statute) for the two previous calendar years and for the current year, up to the date of dividend declaration. During 2011, KeyBank paid $300 million in dividends to the parent, and nonbank subsidiaries paid the parent $33 million in cash dividends, and $12 million in noncash dividends. During 2011, the parent did not make any capital infusions to KeyBank, compared to $100 million during 2010. Based upon existing regulatory guidance, KeyBank has capacity to pay $1.3 billion in dividends to KeyCorp at January 1, 2012. During the first quarter of 2011, the parent company completed a $625 million equity offering at a price of $8.85 per Common Share. In conjunction with the equity offering, the parent company issued $1 billion, 5.1% Senior Medium Term Notes, Series I, during the first quarter of 2011. The proceeds from the sale of Common Shares and medium term notes were used, along with other available funds, to repurchase the Series B Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury. The repurchase eliminated future quarterly dividends of $31 million and discount amortization (non cash) of $4 million, or $140 million on an annual basis, related to these preferred shares. Our liquidity position and recent activity Over the past twelve months our liquid asset portfolio, which includes overnight and short term investments, as well as unencumbered, high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios, has decreased as a result of capital securities redemptions and net customer loan and deposit flows. However, the liquid asset portfolio still continues to exceed the amount we estimate would be necessary to manage through a liquidity event. Liquidity stress scenarios include the loss of access to either unsecured or secured funding sources, as well as draws on unfunded commitments and significant deposit withdrawals. 85 Table of Contents From time to time, KeyCorp or its principal subsidiary, KeyBank, may seek to retire, repurchase or exchange outstanding debt, capital securities or preferred stock through cash purchase, privately negotiated transactions or other means. Such transactions depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity and capital requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. We generate cash flows from operations, and from investing and financing activities. During 2011, we used the proceeds from our debt and Common Share offerings to repurchase our Series B Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury as part of the TARP CPP and to pay dividends. As previously noted, the repurchase eliminated future quarterly dividends of $31 million and discount amortization (non cash) of $4 million, or $140 million on an annual basis, related to these preferred shares. We have approximately $183 million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments in international tax jurisdictions as of December 31, 2011. As we consider alternative long term strategic and liquidity plans, opportunities to repatriate these amounts would result in approximately $30 million in taxes to be paid. If we were to cease operations in all international tax jurisdictions, the total amount of taxes to be paid would increase to approximately $51 million. Accordingly, we have included the total amount as a deferred tax liability at December 31, 2011. The consolidated statements of cash flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for each year ended December 31, 2011, and 2010. Credit ratings Our credit ratings at December 31, 2011, are shown in Figure 33. We believe that these credit ratings, under normal conditions in the capital markets, will enable the parent company or KeyBank to issue fixed income securities to investors. Conditions in the credit markets have materially improved relative to the disruption experienced between the latter part of 2007 and 2009. In the fourth quarter of 2010, Moodys (a credit rating agency that rates KeyCorp and KeyBank debt securities) announced a one notch downgrade of KeyBankss short term borrowings, senior long term debt, and subordinated debt. As a result of this decision by Moodys, on March 7, 2011, KeyBank transferred approximately $1.5 billion of certain escrow deposit balances to an acceptably rated institution resulting in an immaterial impairment of the related mortgage servicing assets. For more information regarding this transfer of escrow deposit balances and the related mortgage servicing assets see Note 9 (Mortgage Servicing Assets). More recently on December 6, 2011, Standard & Poors announced a ratings review of 31 North American regional banks and their subsidiaries under its new bank ratings criteria announced November 9, 2011. S&Ps updated their ratings outlook on both KeyCorp and KeyBank from Stable to Positive, and maintained the ratings for KeyCorp and KeyBank. Additional information on the liquidity risks presented to us in the event of a downgrade of our security ratings is included in Item A: Risk Factors. Figure 33.

Like other financial services institutions, we make loans, extend credit, purchase securities and enter into financial derivative contracts, all of which have related credit risk. Credit policy, approval and evaluation We manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program. The Credit Risk Committee approves both retail and commercial credit policies. These policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit. Our credit risk management team is responsible for credit approval, is independent of our lines of business, and consists of senior officers who have extensive experience in structuring and approving loans. Only credit risk management members are authorized to grant significant exceptions to credit policies. It is not unusual to make exceptions to established policies when mitigating circumstances dictate, but most major lending units have been assigned specific thresholds to keep exceptions at a manageable level. Loan grades are assigned at the time of origination, verified by the credit risk management team and periodically reevaluated thereafter. Most extensions of credit are subject to loan grading or scoring. This risk rating methodology blends our judgment with quantitative modeling. Commercial loans generally are assigned two internal risk ratings. The first rating reflects the probability that the borrower will default on an obligation; the second rating reflects expected recovery rates on the credit facility. Default probability is determined based on, among other factors, the financial strength of the borrower, an assessment of the borrowers management, the borrowers competitive position within its industry sector, and our view of industry risk within the context of the general economic outlook. Types of exposure, transaction structure and collateral, including credit risk mitigants, affect the expected recovery assessment. Our credit risk management team uses risk models to evaluate consumer loans. These models, known as scorecards, forecast the probability of serious delinquency and default for an applicant. The scorecards are embedded in the application processing system, which allows for real time scoring and automated decisions for many of our products. We periodically validate the loan grading and scoring processes. We maintain an active concentration management program to encourage diversification in our credit portfolios. For individual obligors, we employ a sliding scale of exposure, known as hold limits, which is dictated by the strength of the borrower. Our legal lending limit is approximately $2 billion for any individual borrower. However, internal hold limits generally restrict the largest exposures to less than 20% of that amount. As of December 31, 2011, we had four client relationships with loan commitments net of credit default swaps of more than $200 million. The average amount outstanding on these four individual net obligor commitments was $120 million at December 31, 2011. In general, our philosophy is to maintain a diverse portfolio with regard to credit exposures. We actively manage the overall loan portfolio in a manner consistent with asset quality objectives, including the use of credit derivatives primarily credit default swaps to mitigate credit risk. Credit default swaps enable us to transfer a portion of the credit risk associated with a particular extension of credit to a third party. At December 31, 2011, we used credit default swaps with a notional amount of $986 million to manage the credit risk associated with specific commercial lending obligations. We also sell credit derivatives primarily index credit default swaps to diversify and manage portfolio concentration and correlation risks. At December 31, 2011, the notional amount of credit default swaps sold by us for the purpose of diversifying our credit exposure was $360 million. Occasionally, we have provided credit protection to other lenders through the sale of credit default swaps. These transactions with other lenders generated fee income. 87 Table of Contents Credit default swaps are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Related gains or losses, as well as the premium paid or received for credit protection, are included in the trading income component of noninterest income. We also manage the loan portfolio using portfolio swaps and bulk purchases and sales. Our overarching goal is to manage the loan portfolio within a specified range of asset quality. Selected asset quality statistics for each of the past five years are presented in Figure 34. The factors that drive these statistics are discussed in the remainder of this section. Figure 34.

Watch and criticized assets Watch assets are troubled commercial loans with the potential to deteriorate in quality due to the clients current financial condition and possible inability to perform in accordance with the terms of the underlying contract. Criticized assets are troubled loans and other assets that show additional signs of weakness that may lead, or have led, to an interruption in scheduled repayments from primary sources, potentially requiring us to rely on repayment from secondary sources, such as collateral liquidation. Criticized loan and lease outstandings showed improvement during 2011 decreasing 39.6% from one year ago. Allowance for loan and lease losses At December 31, 2011, the allowance for loan and lease losses was $1 billion, or 2.03% of loans, compared to $1.6 billion, or 3.20%, at December 31, 2010. The allowance includes $51 million that was specifically allocated for impaired loans of $388 million at December 31, 2011, compared to $58 million that was allocated for impaired loans of $621 million one year ago. For more information about impaired loans, see Note 5 (Asset Quality). At December 31, 2011, the allowance for loan and lease losses was 138.10% of nonperforming loans, compared to 150.19% at December 31, 2010. We estimate the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses on at least a quarterly basis. The methodology used is described in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) under the heading Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses. Briefly, we apply historical loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions, changes in credit policies or underwriting standards, and changes in the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets. For all commercial TDRs, regardless of size, as well as impaired commercial 88 Table of Contents loans having an outstanding balance greater than $2.5 million, we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss content and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate. A specific allowance also may be assigned even when sources of repayment appear sufficient if we remain uncertain about whether the loan will be repaid in full. The allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2011, represents our best estimate of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date. As shown in Figure 35, our allowance for loan and lease losses decreased by $600 million, or 37%, during the past twelve months. This contraction was associated with the improvement in credit quality of the loan portfolio, which has trended more favorably along with the decrease in loan levels over the past twelve months. Asset quality is improving and has resulted in favorable risk rating migration and a reduction in our general allowance. Our delinquency trends continue to decline while our roll rates keep improving. We attribute this to a more moderate level of economic activity, more favorable conditions in the capital markets, improvement in client income statements and continued run off in our exit loan portfolio. Our liability for credit losses on lending related commitments decreased by $28 million to $45 million at December 31, 2011, compared to the same period one year ago. When combined with our allowance for loan and lease losses, our total allowance for credit losses represented 2.12% of loans at the end of 2011 compared to 3.35% at the end of 2010. We expect the allowance to decrease as a percent of total loans during 2012 as a result of anticipated improvement in credit quality. Figure 35.

Our net loan charge offs for 2011 exceeded the provision for loan and lease losses by $601 million. The decrease in our provision is due to the improving credit quality we have experienced in most of our loan portfolios and the reduction of our outstanding loan balances. Additionally, we continue to work our exit loans, and reduce exposure in our higher risk businesses including the residential properties portion of our construction loan portfolio, Marine/RV financing, and other selected leasing portfolios through the sale of certain loans, payments from borrowers or net charge offs. As these outstanding loan balances decrease, so does their required allowance for loan and lease losses and corresponding provision. Net loan charge offs Net loan charge offs for 2011 totaled $541 million, or 1.11% of average loans from continuing operations. These results compare to net charge offs of $1.6 billion, or 2.91%, for the same period last year. Figure 36 shows the trend in our net loan charge offs by loan type, while the composition of loan charge offs and recoveries by type of loan is presented in Figure 37. Over the past twelve months, net charge offs in the commercial loan portfolio decreased by $912 million. Net charge offs for this line of business declined by $487 million from 2010. As shown in Figure 39, our exit loan portfolio accounted for $115 million, or 21%, of total net loan charge offs for 2011. Net charge offs in the exit loan portfolio decreased by $338 million from 2010, primarily driven by a decrease in net charge offs in the commercial loan portfolios. Figure 36.

These concessions are made to improve the collectability of the loan and generally take the form of a reduction of the interest rate, extension of the maturity date or reduction in the principal balance. (b) During the second quarter of 2008, we transferred $384 million of commercial real estate loans ($719 million of primarily construction loans, net of $335 million in net charge offs) from the loan portfolio to held for sale status. (c) See Figure 17 and the accompanying discussion in the Loans and loans held for sale section for more information related to our commercial real estate portfolio. (d) Included in the commercial, financial and agricultural portfolio is a $67 million middle market past due credit which was resolved in January 2011. 92 Table of Contents As shown in Figure 38, nonperforming assets decreased during 2011, having declined for the past two years. Most of the reduction came from nonperforming loans, nonperforming loans held for sale and OREO in the Commercial Real Estate line of business. As shown in Figure 39, our exit loan portfolio accounted for $119 million, or 14%, of total nonperforming assets at December 31, 2011, compared to $210 million, or 16%, in 2010. At December 31, 2011, the carrying amount of our commercial nonperforming loans outstanding represented 62% of their original contractual amount owed, total nonperforming loans outstanding represented 70% of their contractual amount owed and total nonperforming assets represented 65% of their original contractual amount owed. At the same date, OREO represented 41% of its original contractual amount owed, while loans held for sale and other nonperforming assets in the aggregate represented 48% of their contractual amount owed. At December 31, 2011, our 20 largest nonperforming loans totaled $237 million, representing 33% of total loans on nonperforming status from continuing operations as compared to $306 million representing 29%, respectively in the prior year. Figure 39 shows the composition of our exit loan portfolio at December 31, 2011 and 2010, the net charge offs recorded on this portfolio, and the nonperforming status of these loans at these dates. The exit loan portfolio represented 8% of total loans and loans held for sale at December 31, 2011 as compared to 11% at December 31, 2010. Additional information about loan sales is included in the Loans and loans held for sale section under Loan sales. Figure 39.

These events include, among other things, threats to our cybersecurity, as we are reliant upon information systems and the internet to conduct our business activities. Operational risk also encompasses compliance risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules and regulations, prescribed practices, and ethical standards. Due to the passage of the Dodd Frank Act, large financial companies like Key will be subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation due to their systemic importance. This heightened level of regulation will increase our operational risk. We have created work teams to respond to and analyze the new regulatory requirements imposed upon us and that will be promulgated as a result of the enactment of the Dodd Frank Act. Resulting operational risk losses and or additional regulatory compliance costs could take the form of explicit charges, increased operational costs, harm to our reputation or forgone opportunities. We seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk, alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance, and a system of internal controls and reporting. We continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of our operational risk and to ensure compliance with laws, rules and regulations. For example, an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses. This tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action. We also rely upon software programs designed to assist in the assessment of operational risk and monitoring our control processes. This technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the Board of Directors. 95 Table of Contents Primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business. Our Operational Risk Management function manages the Operational Risk Management Program which provides the framework for the structure, governance, roles and responsibilities as well as the content to manage operational risk for Key. The Operational Risk Committee, a senior management committee, oversees our level of operational risk, and directs and supports our operational infrastructure and related activities. This committee and the Operational Risk Management function are an integral part of our ERM Program. Our Risk Review function periodically assesses the overall effectiveness of our Operational Risk Management Program and our system of internal controls. Risk Review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the Audit Committee, and independently supports the Audit Committees oversight of these controls. Fourth Quarter Results Our financial performance for each of the past eight quarters is summarized in Figure 44. Highlights of our results for the fourth quarter of 2011 are summarized below. Earnings We had a fourth quarter net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $201 million, or $.21 per common share, compared to a net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $292 million, or $.33 per Common Share, for the fourth quarter of 2010. The fourth quarter 2011 results were negatively impacted by a $24 million charge resulting from Visas late fourth quarter announcement of a planned litigation escrow deposit. In addition, Key recorded a $28 million gain on the sale of Tuition Management Systems during the fourth quarter of 2010. Fourth quarter 2011 net income attributable to Key common shareholders was $194 million compared to net income attributable to Key common shareholders of $279 million for the same quarter one year ago. On an annualized basis, our return on average total assets from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2011 was 1.01%, compared to 1.53% for the fourth quarter of 2010. The annualized return on average common equity from continuing operations was 8.26% for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to 13.71% for the year ago quarter. Net interest income Our taxable equivalent net interest income was $563 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, and the net interest margin was 3.13%. These results compare to taxable equivalent net interest income of $635 million and a net interest margin of 3.31% for the fourth quarter of 2010. The decrease in net interest income is attributable to both a decline in earning assets and the net interest margin. The net interest margin has been under pressure as a result of the continuation of the low rate environment contracting the spread between lending rates and funding costs. Noninterest income Our noninterest income was $414 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to $526 million for the year ago quarter. Investment banking and capital markets income decreased $39 million compared to the same period one year ago, which includes a $24 million charge resulting from Visas late fourth quarter announcement of a planned increase to its litigation escrow deposit. Other income also decreased from the year ago quarter due to a $28 million gain from the sale of Tuition Management Systems in the fourth quarter of 2010. Also contributing to the decline in noninterest income were decreases in operating lease income of $17 million and net securities gains (losses) of $12 million. Electronic banking fees also declined $13 million as a result of new government pricing controls on debit transactions which were effective October 1, 2011. 96 Table of Contents Noninterest expense Our noninterest expense was $717 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to $744 million for the same period last year. The improvement in expense levels resulted from declines of $20 million in FDIC deposit insurance premiums, $10 million in operating lease expense and reductions across several other expense categories. These decreases were partially offset by a $21 million increase in employee benefits expense due to higher medical claims expense compared to the year ago quarter when Key recorded a reduced amount due to favorable experience. In addition, the fourth quarter reflected a credit of $11 million in the provision (credit) for losses on lending related commitments compared to a credit of $26 million in the same period one year ago. Provision for loan and lease losses Our provision for loan and lease losses was a credit of $22 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to a credit of $97 million for the year ago quarter and a charge of $10 million for the third quarter of 2011. Keys allowance for loan and lease losses was $1 billion, or 2.03% of total period end loans, at December 31, 2011, compared to 2.35% at September 30, 2011, and 3.20% at December 31, 2010. Net loan charge offs for the quarter totaled $105 million, or .86% of average loans. These results compare to $256 million, or 2.00%, for the same period last year and $109 million, or .90%, for the previous quarter. Net loan charge offs have declined for the last eight consecutive quarters and were less than one percent of average loans for the second consecutive quarter. Income taxes For the fourth quarter of 2011, we recorded a tax provision from continuing operations of $69 million compared to a tax provision of $172 million for the fourth quarter of 2010. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2011 was 25.2% compared with 33.7% for the same quarter one year prior. For the fourth quarter of 2011, the tax rate was lower due to lower pre tax income and slightly higher tax credits earned during the period. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we recorded domestic deferred income tax expense of $32 million as a result of our change in assertion as to indefinitely reinvesting in non US subsidiaries. 97 Table of Contents Figure 44.

(c) Represents period end consolidated total loans and loans held for sale (excluding education loans in securitizations trusts) divided by period end consolidated total deposits (excluding deposits in foreign office). Critical accounting policies and estimates Our business is dynamic and complex. Consequently, we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies. These choices are critical; not only are they necessary to comply with GAAP, they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance. All accounting policies are important, and all policies described in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance. In our opinion, some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility. These policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance, or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. Because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances, they may prove to be inaccurate, or we may find it necessary to change them. As described below, we rely heavily on the use of judgment, assumptions and estimates to make a number of core decisions. We have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee. Allowance for loan and lease losses The loan portfolio is the largest category of assets on our balance sheet. We consider a variety of data to determine probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio and to establish an allowance that is sufficient to absorb those losses. For example, we apply historical loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions, lending policies, underwriting standards, and the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets. Other considerations include expected cash flows and estimated collateral values. For all commercial troubled debt restructurings, regardless of size, as well as all other impaired commercial loans with an outstanding balance greater than $2.5 million, we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate. For example, a specific allowance may be assigned even when sources of repayment appear sufficient if we remain uncertain that an impaired loan will be repaid in full. We continually assess the risk profile of the loan portfolio and adjust the allowance for loan and lease losses when appropriate. The economic and business climate in any given industry or market is difficult to gauge and can change rapidly, and the effects of those changes can vary by borrower. However, since our total loan portfolio is well diversified in many respects, and the risk profile of certain segments of the loan portfolio may be improving while the risk profile of others is deteriorating, we may decide to change the level of the allowance for one segment of the portfolio without changing it for any other segment. In addition to adjusting the allowance for loan and lease losses to reflect market conditions, we also may adjust the allowance because of unique events that are likely to cause actual losses to vary abruptly and significantly from expected losses. For example, class action lawsuits brought against an industry segment (e.g., one that used asbestos in its product) can cause a precipitous deterioration in the risk profile of borrowers doing business in that segment. Conversely, the dismissal of such lawsuits can improve the risk profile. In either case, historical loss rates for that industry segment would not have provided a precise basis for determining the appropriate level of allowance. 99 Table of Contents Even minor changes in the level of estimated losses can significantly affect managements determination of the appropriate level of allowance because those changes must be applied across a large portfolio. To illustrate, an increase in estimated losses equal to one tenth of one percent of our consumer loan portfolio as of December 31, 2011, would indicate the need for a $15 million increase in the level of the allowance. The same level of increase in estimated losses for the commercial loan portfolio would result in a $35 million increase in the allowance. Such adjustments to the allowance for loan and lease losses can materially affect financial results. Following the above examples, a $15 million increase in the consumer loan portfolio allowance would have reduced our earnings on an after tax basis by approximately $9 million, or $.01 per share; a $35 million increase in the commercial loan portfolio allowance would have reduced earnings on an after tax basis by approximately $22 million, or $.02 per share. As we make decisions regarding the allowance, we benefit from a lengthy organizational history and experience with credit evaluations and related outcomes. Nonetheless, if our underlying assumptions later prove to be inaccurate, the allowance for loan and lease losses would likely need to be adjusted, possibly having an adverse effect on our results of operations. Our accounting policy related to the allowance is disclosed in Note 1 under the heading Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses. Valuation methodologies We follow the applicable accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. In the absence of quoted market prices, we determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities using internally developed models, which are based on third party data as well as our judgment, assumptions and estimates regarding credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and other relevant market available inputs. We describe our application of this accounting guidance, the process used to determine fair values and the fair value hierarchy in Note 1 under the heading Fair Value Measurements and in Note 6 (Fair Value Measurements). Valuation methodologies often involve significant judgment, particularly when there are no observable active markets for the items being valued. To determine the values of assets and liabilities, as well as the extent to which related assets may be impaired, we make assumptions and estimates related to discount rates, asset returns, prepayment rates and other factors. The use of different discount rates or other valuation assumptions could produce significantly different results. The outcomes of valuations that we perform have a direct bearing on the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities, including loans held for sale, principal investments, goodwill, and pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. At December 31, 2011, $18.7 billion, or 21%, of our total assets were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Substantially all of these assets were classified as Level 1 or Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. At December 31, 2011, $1.7 billion, or 2%, of our total liabilities were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Substantially all of these liabilities were classified as Level 1 or Level 2. At December 31, 2011, $208 million, or .2%, of our total assets were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Approximately 9% of these assets were classified as Level 1 or Level 2. At December 31, 2011, there were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. A discussion of the valuation methodology applied to our loans held for sale is included in Note 1 under the heading Loans Held for Sale. Our principal investments include direct and indirect investments, predominantly in privately held companies. The fair values of these investments are determined by considering a number of factors, including the target companys financial condition and results of operations, values of public companies in comparable businesses, 100 Table of Contents market liquidity, and the nature and duration of resale restrictions. The fair value of principal investments was $709 million at December 31, 2011. A 10% positive or negative variance in that fair value would have increased or decreased our 2011 earnings by approximately $71 million ($45 million after tax, or $.05 per share). The valuation and testing methodologies used in our analysis of goodwill impairment are summarized in Note 1 under the heading Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The first step in testing for impairment is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit. Our reporting units for purposes of this testing are our two major business segments: Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank. Fair values are estimated using comparable external market data (market approach) and discounted cash flow modeling that incorporates an appropriate risk premium and earnings forecast information (income approach). We perform a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit as appropriate. We believe the estimates and assumptions used in the goodwill impairment analysis for our reporting units are reasonable. However, if actual results and market conditions differ from the assumptions or estimates used, the fair value of each reporting unit could change in the future. The second step of impairment testing is necessary only if the carrying amount of either reporting unit exceeds its fair value, suggesting goodwill impairment. In such a case, we would estimate a hypothetical purchase price for the reporting unit (representing the units fair value) and then compare that hypothetical purchase price with the fair value of the units net assets (excluding goodwill). Any excess of the estimated purchase price over the fair value of the reporting units net assets represents the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss would be recognized as a charge to earnings if the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill. Due to the economic uncertainty experienced since 2007, we have conducted quarterly reviews of the applicable goodwill impairment indicators and evaluated the carrying amount of our goodwill, as necessary. At December 31, 2011, the Key Community Bank reporting unit had $917 million in goodwill, while the Key Corporate Bank reporting unit had no recorded goodwill. As a result of our sale of Tuition Management Systems in December 2010, customer relationship intangible assets of $15 million were written off against the purchase price to determine the net gain during 2010. During 2009, we recorded noncash charges for intangible assets impairment of $241 million ($192 million after tax, or $.28 per common share). See Note 10 (Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets) for a summary of the events that resulted in these charges. The primary assumptions used in determining our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and related expenses, including sensitivity analysis of these assumptions, are presented in Note 19 (Employee Benefits). When potential asset impairment is identified, we must exercise judgment to determine the nature of the potential impairment (i.e., temporary or other than temporary) to apply the appropriate accounting treatment. For example, unrealized losses on securities available for sale that are deemed temporary are recorded in shareholders equity; those deemed other than temporary are recorded in either earnings or shareholders equity based on certain factors. Additional information regarding temporary and other than temporary impairment on securities available for sale at December 31, 2011, is provided in Note 7 (Securities). Derivatives and hedging We use primarily interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk for asset and liability management purposes. These derivative instruments modify the interest rate characteristics of specified on balance sheet assets and liabilities. Our accounting policies related to derivatives reflect the current accounting guidance, which provides that all derivatives should be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value, after taking into account the effects of master netting agreements. Accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a particular derivative depends on whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship, and further, on the type of hedging relationship. 101 Table of Contents The application of hedge accounting requires significant judgment to interpret the relevant accounting guidance, as well as to assess hedge effectiveness, identify similar hedged item groupings, and measure changes in the fair value of the hedged items. We believe our methods of addressing these judgments and applying the accounting guidance are consistent with both the guidance and industry practices. However, interpretations of the applicable accounting guidance continue to change and evolve. In the future, these evolving interpretations could result in material changes to our accounting for derivative financial instruments and related hedging activities. Although such changes may not have a material effect on our financial condition, a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which it occurs. Additional information relating to our use of derivatives is included in Note 1 under the heading Derivatives and Note 8 (Derivatives and Hedging Activities). Contingent liabilities, guarantees and income taxes Note 16 (Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees) summarizes contingent liabilities arising from litigation and contingent liabilities arising from guarantees in various agreements with third parties under which we are a guarantor, and the potential effects of these items on the results of our operations. We record a liability for the fair value of the obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of a guarantee, but there is a risk that our actual future payments in the event of a default by the guaranteed party could exceed the recorded amount. See Note 16 for a comparison of the liability recorded and the maximum potential undiscounted future payments for the various types of guarantees that we had outstanding at December 31, 2011. It is not always clear how the Internal Revenue Code and various state tax laws apply to transactions that we undertake. In the normal course of business, we may record tax benefits and then have those benefits contested by the IRS or state tax authorities. We have provided tax reserves that we believe are adequate to absorb potential adjustments that such challenges may necessitate. However, if our judgment later proves to be inaccurate, the tax reserves may need to be adjusted, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and capital. Additionally, we conduct quarterly assessments that determine the amount of deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized, and therefore recorded. The available evidence used in connection with these assessments includes taxable income in prior periods, projected future taxable income, potential tax planning strategies and projected future reversals of deferred tax items. These assessments are subjective and may change. Based on these criteria, and in particular our projections for future taxable income, we currently believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize our net deferred tax asset in future periods. However, if our assessments prove incorrect, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which they occur. For further information on our accounting for income taxes, see Note 12 (Income Taxes). During 2011, we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related assumptions and estimates. 102 Table of Contents European Sovereign Debt Exposures Our total European sovereign and non sovereign debt exposure is presented in Figure 45.
