Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in this annual report on Form 10 K. Historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the Consolidated Statements of Income contained in the Consolidated Financial Statements, including trends which might appear, should not be taken as indicative of future operations. Critical Accounting Policies The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company include the accounts of the Company, its wholly owned subsidiaries and all partnerships in which the Company has a controlling interest. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. These estimates are based on, but not limited to, historical results, industry standards and current economic conditions, giving due consideration to materiality. The most significant assumptions and estimates relate to revenue recognition and the recoverability of trade accounts receivable, depreciable lives and valuation of real estate. Application of these assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable Base rental revenues from rental property are recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the related leases. Certain of these leases also provide for percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the lessee. These percentage rents are recorded once the required sales level is achieved. In addition, leases typically provide for reimbursement to the Company of common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other operating expenses. Operating expense reimbursements are recognized as earned. Rental income may also include payments received in connection with lease termination agreements. The Company makes estimates of the uncollectability of its accounts receivable related to base rents, expense reimbursements and other revenues. The Company analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels, customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and estimates are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre petition and post petition claims. The Companys reported net income is directly affected by managements estimate of the collectability of accounts receivable. The Company believes that its revenue recognition policy is in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles and in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition. Real Estate Land, buildings and fixtures and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Significant renovations and replacements, which improve and extend the life of the asset, are capitalized. Depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows: Buildings 15 to 39 years Fixtures and leasehold improvements Terms of leases or useful lives, whichever is shorter The Company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties. These assessments have a direct impact on the Companys net income. Real estate under development on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets represent ground up development projects which are held for sale upon completion. These assets are carried at cost and no depreciation is recorded. The cost of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. The Company ceases cost capitalization when the property is held available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from the completion of major construction activity. If in managements opinion, the estimated net sales price of these assets is less than the net carrying value, an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. A gain on the sale of these assets is generally recognized using the full accrual method in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 66, Accounting for Real Estate Sales. 34 Long Lived Assets On a periodic basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the real estate properties may be impaired. A property value is considered impaired only if managements estimate of current and projected operating cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the property over its remaining useful life is less than the net carrying value of the property. Such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income, trend and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. To the extent impairment has occurred, the carrying value of the property would be adjusted to an amount to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. When a real estate asset is identified by management as held for sale the Company ceases depreciation of the asset and estimates the sales price of such asset net of selling costs. If, in managements opinion, the net sales price of the asset is less than the net book value of such asset, an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. The Company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate properties, investments in joint ventures and other investments. The Companys reported net income is directly affected by managements estimate of impairments and or valuation allowances recognized. Results of Operations Comparison 2002 to 2001 Revenues from rental property increased $0.4 million or 0.1% to $450.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared with $450.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This net increase resulted primarily from the combined effect of (i) the acquisition of 13 operating properties during 2002, providing revenues of $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, (ii) the full year impact related to the three operating properties acquired in 2001 providing incremental revenues of $2.3 million, and (iii) the completion of certain development and redevelopment projects, tenant buyouts and new leasing within the portfolio providing incremental revenues of approximately $20.5 million as compared to the corresponding year ended December 31, 2001, offset by (iv) an overall decrease in shopping center portfolio occupancy to 87.8% at December 31, 2002 as compared to 90.4% at December 31, 2001 due primarily to the bankruptcy filing of Kmart Corporation ("Kmart") and Ames Department Stores, Inc. ("Ames") and subsequent rejection of leases resulting in a decrease of revenues of approximately $25.1 million as compared to the preceding year, and (v) sales of certain shopping center properties throughout 2001 and 2002, resulting in a decrease of revenues of approximately $2.4 million as compared to the preceding year. Rental property expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased $11.0 million or 5.9% to $196.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $185.8 million for the preceding year. The rental property expense component of real estate taxes increased approximately $7.3 million or 13.1% for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2001. This increase relates primarily to the payment of real estate taxes by the Company on certain Kmart anchored locations where Kmart previously paid the real estate taxes directly to the taxing authorities. The rental property expense component of operating and maintenance increased approximately $1.5 million or 3.2% for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2001. This increase is primarily due to property acquisitions during 2002 and 2001, renovations within the portfolio and higher professional fees relating to tenant bankruptcies. Equity in income of real estate joint ventures, net increased $15.4 million to $35.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This increase is primarily attributable to the equity in income from the Kimco Income REIT joint venture investment, the RioCan joint venture investment, and the KROP joint venture investment as described below. During 1998, the Company formed KIR, a limited partnership established to invest in high quality retail properties financed primarily through the use of individual non recourse mortgages. The Company has a 43.3% non controlling limited partnership interest in KIR, which the Company manages, and accounts for its investment in KIR under the equity method of accounting. Equity in income of KIR increased $3.1 million to $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to $13.2 million for the preceding year. This increase is primarily due to the Companys increased capital investment in KIR totaling $23.8 million during 2002 and $30.8 million during 2001. The additional capital investments received by KIR from the Company and its other institutional partners were used to purchase additional shopping center properties throughout calendar year 2002 and 2001. 35 During October 2001, the Company formed a joint venture (the "RioCan Venture") with RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust ("RioCan", Canadas largest publicly traded REIT measured by gross leasable area ("GLA")), in which the Company has a 50% non controlling interest, to acquire retail properties and development projects in Canada. As of December 31, 2002, the RioCan Venture consisted of 28 shopping center properties and four development projects with approximately 6.7 million square feet of GLA. The Companys equity in income from the RioCan Venture increased approximately $8.7 million to $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to $0.4 million for the preceding year. During October 2001, the Company formed the Kimco Retail Opportunity Fund ("KROP"), a joint venture with GE Capital Real Estate ("GECRE") which the Company manages and has a 20% interest. The purpose of this venture is to acquire established, high growth potential retail properties in the United States. As of December 31, 2002, KROP consisted of 15 shopping center properties with approximately 1.5 million square feet of GLA. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Companys equity in income from KROP was approximately $0.9 million. Minority interests in income of partnerships, net increased $0.7 million to $2.4 million as compared to $1.7 million for the preceding year. This increase is primarily due to the acquisition of a shopping center property acquired through a newly formed partnership by issuing approximately 2.4 million downREIT units valued at $80 million. The downREIT units are convertible at a ratio of 1:1 into the Companys common stock and are entitled to a distribution equal to the dividend rate on the Companys common stock multiplied by 1.1057. Income from other real estate investments decreased $22.1 million to $16.0 million as compared to $38.1 million for the preceding year. This decrease is primarily due to the decrease in income from the Montgomery Ward asset designation rights transactions described below. During March 2001, the Company, through a taxable REIT subsidiary, formed a real estate joint venture (the "Ward Venture") in which the Company has a 50% interest, for purposes of acquiring asset designation rights for substantially all of the real estate property interests of the bankrupt estate of Montgomery Ward LLC and its affiliates. These asset designation rights have provided the Ward Venture the ability to direct the ultimate disposition of the 315 fee and leasehold interests held by the bankrupt estate, of which 303 transactions have been completed to date. During the year ended December 31, 2002 the Ward Venture completed transactions of 32 properties. The pre tax profits from the Ward Venture decreased approximately $23.3 million to $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $34.6 million for the preceding year. Mortgage financing income increased $17.1 million to $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This increase is primarily due to increased interest income earned related to certain real estate lending activities during the year ended December 31, 2002. Effective January 1, 2001, the Company has elected taxable REIT subsidiary status for its wholly owned development subsidiary ("KDI"). KDI is primarily engaged in the ground up development of neighborhood and community shopping centers and the subsequent sale thereof upon completion. During the year ended December 31, 2002, KDI sold four projects and eight out parcels, in separate transactions, for approximately $128.7 million, including the assignment of approximately $17.7 million of mortgage debt encumbering one of the properties. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of approximately $15.9 million. During the year ended December 31, 2001, KDI sold two of its recently completed projects and five out parcels, in separate transactions, for approximately $61.3 million, which resulted in pre tax profits of $13.4 million. Management and other fee income increased approximately $6.4 million to $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This increase is primarily due to (i) a $1.1 million increase in management fees from KIR resulting from the growth of the KIR portfolio, (ii) $2.3 million of management and acquisition fees relating to the KROP joint venture activities during the year ended December 31, 2002 and (iii) increased property management activity providing incremental fee income of approximately $3.0 million. 36 Other income/(loss), net increased approximately $4.7 million to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to the preceding calendar year. This increase is primarily due to pre tax profits earned from the Companys participation in ventures established to provide inventory liquidation services to regional retailers in bankruptcy. Interest expense decreased $1.7 million or 1.9% to $86.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared with $88.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This decrease is primarily due to reduced interest costs on the Companys floating rate revolving credit facilities and remarketed reset notes which was partially offset by an increase in borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to the preceding year. General and administrative expenses increased approximately $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to the preceding calendar year. This increase is primarily due to higher costs related to the growth of the Company including (i) increased senior management and staff levels, (ii) increased system related costs and (iii) other personnel related costs. The Company had previously encumbered seven Kmart sites with individual non recourse mortgages aggregating approximately $70.8 million as part of its strategy to reduce its exposure to Kmart Corporation. As a result of the Kmart bankruptcy filing in January of 2002 and the subsequent rejection of leases including leases at these encumbered sites, the Company, during July 2002, had suspended debt services payments on these loans and was actively negotiating with the respective lenders. During December 2002, the Company reached agreement with certain lenders in connection with four of these locations. The Company paid approximately $24.2 million in full satisfaction of these loans which aggregated approximately $46.5 million. The Company recognized a gain on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $22.3 million. During December 2002, the Company identified two operating properties, comprised of approximately 0.2 million square feet of GLA, as "Held for Sale" in accordance with FASB No. 144. The book value of these properties, aggregating approximately $28.4 million, net of accumulated depreciation of approximately $2.9 million, exceeded their estimated fair value. The Companys determination of the fair value of these properties, aggregating approximately $7.9 million, is based upon executed contracts of sale with third parties less estimated selling costs. As a result, the Company recorded an adjustment of property carrying values of $20.5 million. This adjustment is included, along with the related property operations for the current and comparative years, in the caption Income/(loss) from discontinued operations on the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income. As part of the Companys periodic assessment of its real estate properties with regard to both the extent to which such assets are consistent with the Companys long term real estate investment objectives and the performance and prospects of each asset, the Company determined in the fourth quarter of 2002, that its investment in four operating properties, comprised of an aggregate 0.4 million square feet of GLA with an aggregate net book value of approximately $23.8 million, may not be fully recoverable. Based upon managements assessment of current market conditions and the lack of demand for the properties, the Company has reduced its potential holding period of these investments. As a result of the reduction in the anticipated holding period, together with a reassessment of the projected future operating income of the properties and the effects of current market conditions, the Company has determined that its investment in these assets was not fully recoverable and has recorded an adjustment of property carrying value aggregating approximately $12.5 million. During 2002, the Company, (i) disposed of, in separate transactions, 12 operating properties for an aggregate sales price of approximately $74.5 million, including the assignment/repayment of approximately $22.6 million of mortgage debt encumbering three of the properties and, (ii) terminated five leasehold positions in locations where a tenant in bankruptcy had rejected its lease. These dispositions resulted in net gains of approximately $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets ("FASB No. 144"), the operations and net gain on disposition of these properties have been included in the caption Discontinued operations on the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income. During 2001, the Company, in separate transactions, disposed of three operating properties, including the sale of a property to KIR, and a portion of another operating property comprising in the aggregate approximately 0.6 million square feet of GLA. Cash proceeds from these dispositions aggregated approximately $46.7 million, which resulted in a net gain of approximately $3.0 million. Cash proceeds from the sale of the operating property in Elyria, OH totaling $5.8 million, together with an additional $7.1 million cash investment, were used to acquire an exchange shopping center property located in Lakeland, FL during August 2001. 37 Net income for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $245.7 million as compared to $236.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, representing an increase of $9.2 million. This increase reflects the combined effect of increased contributions from the investments in KIR, KROP, the RioCan Venture and other financing investments, reduced by lower income resulting from tenant bankruptcies and subsequent rejection of leases and a decrease in profits from the Ward Venture. Comparison 2001 to 2000 Revenues from rental property increased $9.1 million or 2.1% to $450.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, as compared with $441.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. This net increase resulted primarily from the combined effect of (i) the acquisition of three operating properties during 2001, providing revenues of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, (ii) the full year impact related to the 12 operating properties acquired in 2000 providing incremental revenues of $3.5 million, and (iii) the completion of certain development and redevelopment projects and new leasing within the portfolio providing incremental revenues of approximately $11.9 million as compared to the corresponding year ended December 31, 2000, offset by (iv) the commencement of new redevelopment projects and tenant buyouts causing a temporary increase in vacancy, sales of certain shopping center properties throughout 2001 and 2000 and an overall decrease in shopping center portfolio occupancy to 90.1% at December 31, 2001 as compared to 92.9% at December 31, 2000 due primarily to bankruptcies of tenants and subsequent rejections of leases resulting in a decrease of revenues of approximately $7.6 million as compared to the preceding year. Rental property expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased $9.2 million or 5.2% to $185.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to $176.6 million for the preceding year. The rental property expense components of real estate taxes and operating and maintenance increased approximately $1.8 million and $4.4 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2000. Depreciation and amortization increased $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to the preceding year. These increases are primarily due to property acquisitions during 2001 and 2000, renovations within the existing portfolio, the completion of certain redevelopment and development projects, and increased snow removal costs during 2001. Equity in income of real estate joint ventures, net increased $5.6 million to $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to $14.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. This increase is primarily attributable to the KIR transaction described below. During 1998, the Company formed KIR, a limited partnership established to invest in high quality retail properties financed primarily through the use of individual non recourse mortgages. At the time of the formation, the Company contributed 19 property interests to KIR. On April 28, 1999, KIR sold a significant interest in the partnership to institutional investors. As a result, the Company holds a non controlling limited partnership interest in KIR and accounts for its investment in KIR under the equity method of accounting. Equity in income of KIR increased $3.7 million to $13.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, as compared to $9.5 million for the preceding year. This increase is primarily due to the Companys increased capital investment in KIR totaling $30.8 million during 2001 and $29.6 million during 2000. The additional capital investments received by KIR from the Company and its other institutional partners were used to purchase additional shopping center properties throughout calendar years 2001 and 2000. Income from other real estate investments, increased approximately $30.4 million to $38.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared with $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. This increase is primarily due to the Montgomery Ward asset designation rights transaction described below. During March 2001, the Company, through a taxable REIT subsidiary, formed a real estate joint venture (the "Ward Venture") in which the Company has a 50% interest, for purposes of acquiring asset designation rights for substantially all of the real estate property interests of the bankrupt estate of Montgomery Ward LLC and its affiliates. These asset designation rights have provided the Ward Venture the ability to direct the ultimate disposition of the 315 fee and leasehold interests held by the bankrupt estate. The Ward Venture has completed transactions on 271 properties, and the Company has recognized pre tax profits of approximately $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. 38 Mortgage financing income increased approximately $0.8 million to $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. This increase is primarily due to increased interest income earned related to certain real estate lending activities during the year ended December 31, 2001. Effective January 1, 2001, the Company has elected taxable REIT subsidiary status for its wholly owned development subsidiary, KDI. KDI is primarily engaged in the ground up development of neighborhood and community shopping centers and the subsequent sale thereof upon completion. During the year ended December 31, 2001, KDI sold two of its recently completed projects and five out parcels, in separate transactions, for approximately $61.3 million, which resulted in pre tax profits of $13.4 million. Interest, dividends and other investment income increased approximately $0.9 million to $17.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to $16.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Interest, dividends and other investment income is primarily comprised of interest income, dividend income and realized gains related to the Companys investments and sales of certain marketable equity and debt securities. Interest expense decreased $3.3 million or 3.6% to $88.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, as compared with $91.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. This decrease is primarily due to reduced interest costs on the Companys floating rate revolving credit facility and remarketed reset notes during the year ended December 31, 2001, as compared to the preceding year. General and administrative expenses increased approximately $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, as compared to the preceding calendar year. This increase is primarily due to higher costs related to the growth of the Company including (i) increased senior management and staff levels, (ii) increased system related costs and (iii) other personnel related costs. In addition, the Company issued a stock grant award to a newly appointed executive officer of the Company valued at approximately $1.1 million during 2001. During 2001, the Company, in separate transactions, disposed of three operating properties, including the sale of a property to KIR, and a portion of another operating property comprising in the aggregate approximately 0.6 million square feet of GLA. Cash proceeds from these dispositions aggregated approximately $46.7 million, which resulted in a net gain of approximately $3.0 million. Cash proceeds from the sale of the operating property in Elyria, OH totaling $5.8 million, together with an additional $7.1 million cash investment, was used to acquire an exchange shopping center property located in Lakeland, FL during August 2001. During 2000, the Company, in separate transactions, disposed of ten shopping center properties. Sale prices from two of these dispositions aggregated approximately $4.5 million, which approximated their aggregate net book value. Sale prices from eight of these dispositions aggregated approximately $29.7 million, which resulted in net gains of approximately $4.0 million. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $236.5 million as compared to $205.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, representing an increase of $31.5 million. This improved performance reflects the combined effect of internal growth and property acquisitions in the core portfolio, profits from KDI, income from the investment in KIR and profits from the Ward Venture investment, which strengthened profitability. Tenant Concentrations The Company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing risks through diversification achieved by the geographic distribution of its properties, avoiding dependence on any single property, and a large tenant base. At December 31, 2002, the Companys five largest tenants, were Kmart Corporation, The Home Depot, Kohls, TJX Companies, and Wal Mart, which represented approximately 4.5%, 2.8%, 2.7%, 2.5% and 1.9%, respectively, of the Companys annualized base rental revenues, including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the Company has less than a 100% economic interest. On January 22, 2002, Kmart filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As of the filing date, Kmart occupied 69 locations (excluding the KIR portfolio which includes six Kmart locations), representing 12.6% of the Companys annualized base rental revenues and 13.3% of the Companys total shopping center GLA. During 2002, Kmart rejected its leases at 31 locations, representing approximately $30.8 million of annualized base rental revenues and approximately 3.2 million square feet of GLA. As of December 31, 2002, Kmart represented 4.5% of annualized base rents and 6.9% of leased GLA. 39 During December 2002, the Company disposed of, in separate transactions, seven former Kmart sites, comprised of approximately 0.7 million square feet of GLA, for an aggregate sales price of approximately $40.8 million. The Company has currently leased or is under agreement to lease 11 of the rejected locations, has terminated four ground lease locations and has received offers to purchase three of these sites. The Company is reviewing the offers received and is actively marketing the remaining six locations to prospective tenants, however, no assurances can be provided that these locations will be leased in the near term or at comparable rents previously paid by Kmart. The Company previously encumbered seven of these rejected locations with individual non recourse mortgage loans totaling approximately $70.8 million. Annualized interest expense on these loans was approximately $5.6 million. During July 2002, the Company suspended debt service payments on these loans and was actively negotiating with the respective lenders. During December 2002, the Company reached agreements with certain lenders in connection with four of these locations. The Company paid approximately $24.2 million in full satisfaction of these loans aggregating approximately $46.5 million and the Company recognized a gain on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $22.3 million. Also, during December 2002, the Company re tenanted one of these sites and has brought the mortgage loan encumbering this property current. During February 2003, the Company reached agreement with the lender in connection with the remaining two encumbered sites. The Company paid approximately $8.3 million in full satisfaction of these loans which aggregated approximately $14.7 million and the Company will recognize a gain on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $6.2 million during the first quarter of 2003. On January 14, 2003, Kmart announced it would be closing an additional 326 locations of which nine of these locations (excluding the KIR portfolio which includes three additional locations and Kimsouth which includes two additional locations) are leased from the Company. The annualized base rental revenues from these nine locations are approximately $4.3 million. The Company had previously encumbered one of these properties with an individual non recourse mortgage loan. The annualized interest expense for the one encumbered property is approximately $0.8 million. As of the date of this filing of this annual report on Form 10 K, the Company has not been notified directly by Kmart as to the timing of the store closings or whether the leases will be assigned or rejected. Until such time as the leases are rejected, in accordance with the bankruptcy proceedings, Kmart remains obligated for payments of rent and operating expenses at these locations and all other remaining locations. Effective May 1, 2003, the Company has agreed to a five year rent reduction at six Kmart locations, representing approximately 0.6 million square feet of GLA. The average rent was reduced from $8.01 per square foot to $5.57 per square foot, or approximately $1.5 million of annualized base rent. The Company generally will have the right to file claims in connection with these rejected leases for lost rent equal to three years of rental obligations as well as other amounts related to obligations under the leases. Actual amounts to be received in satisfaction of these claims will be subject to Kmarts final plan of reorganization and the availability of funds to pay creditors such as the Company. Liquidity and Capital Resources It is managements intention that the Company continually have access to the capital resources necessary to expand and develop its business. As such, the Company intends to operate with and maintain a conservative capital structure with a level of debt to total market capitalization of 50% or less. As of December 31, 2002 the Companys level of debt to total market capitalization was 31%. In addition, the Company intends to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixed charge coverage ratios as part of its commitment to maintaining its investment grade debt ratings. The Company may, from time to time, seek to obtain funds through additional equity offerings, unsecured debt financings and or mortgage financings and other debt and equity alternatives in a manner consistent with its intention to operate with a conservative debt structure. Since the completion of the Companys IPO in 1991, the Company has utilized the public debt and equity markets as its principal source of capital for its expansion needs. Since the IPO, the Company has completed additional offerings of its public unsecured debt and equity, raising in the aggregate over $2.7 billion for the purposes of, among other things, repaying indebtedness, acquiring interests in neighborhood and community shopping centers, funding ground up development projects, expanding and improving properties in the portfolio and other investments. 40 The Company has a $250.0 million, unsecured revolving credit facility, which is scheduled to expire in August 2003. This credit facility has made available funds to both finance the purchase of properties and meet any short term working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2002 there was $40.0 million outstanding under this credit facility. The Company intends to renew this facility prior to the maturity date. During July 2002, the Company further enhanced its liquidity position by establishing an additional $150.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility. During December 2002, the Company paid down the outstanding balance and terminated this facility. The Company also has a $200.0 million MTN program pursuant to which it may, from time to time, offer for sale its senior unsecured debt for any general corporate purposes, including (i) funding specific liquidity requirements in its business, including property acquisitions, development and redevelopment costs and (ii) managing the Companys debt maturities. (See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K.) As of December 31, 2002, the Company had $98.0 million available for issuance under the MTN program. In addition to the public equity and debt markets as capital sources, the Company may, from time to time, obtain mortgage financing on selected properties. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had over 380 unencumbered property interests in its portfolio. During May 2001, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S 3 for up to $750.0 million of debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock and common stock warrants. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had $288.7 million available for issuance under this shelf registration statement. In connection with its intention to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Company expects to continue paying regular dividends to its stockholders. These dividends will be paid from operating cash flows which are expected to increase due to property acquisitions and growth in operating income in the existing portfolio and from other sources. Since cash used to pay dividends reduces amounts available for capital investment, the Company generally intends to maintain a conservative dividend payout ratio, reserving such amounts as it considers necessary for the expansion and renovation of shopping centers in its portfolio, debt reduction, the acquisition of interests in new properties and other investments as suitable opportunities arise, and such other factors as the Board of Directors considers appropriate. Cash dividends paid increased to $235.6 million in 2002, compared to $209.8 million in 2001 and $189.9 million in 2000. The Companys dividend payout ratio, based on funds from operations on a per basic common share basis, for 2002, 2001 and 2000 was approximately 68.0%, 62.5% and 64.6%, respectively. Although the Company receives substantially all of its rental payments on a monthly basis, it generally intends to continue paying dividends quarterly. Amounts accumulated in advance of each quarterly distribution will be invested by the Company in short term money market or other suitable instruments. The Company anticipates its capital commitment toward redevelopment projects during 2003 will be approximately $30.0 million to $50.0 million. Additionally, the Company anticipates its capital commitment toward ground up development during 2003 will be approximately $160.0 million to $200.0 million. The proceeds from the sales of development properties and proceeds from construction loans in 2003 should be sufficient to fund the ground up development capital requirements. The Company anticipates that cash flows from operations will continue to provide adequate capital to fund its operating and administrative expenses, regular debt service obligations and all dividend payments in accordance with REIT requirements in both the short term and long term. In addition, the Company anticipates that cash on hand, borrowings under its revolving credit facilities, issuance of equity and public debt, as well as other debt and equity alternatives, will provide the necessary capital required by the Company. Cash flows from operations as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows was $278.9 million for 2002, $287.4 million for 2001 and $250.5 million for 2000. 41 Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments The Company has debt obligations relating to its revolving credit facility, MTNs, senior notes, mortgages and construction loans with maturities ranging from one to 22 years. As of December 31, 2002, the Companys total debt had a weighted average term to maturity of approximately five years. In addition, the Company has non cancelable operating leases pertaining to its shopping center portfolio. As of December 31, 2002, the Company has certain shopping center properties that are subject to long term ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to the Company to construct and or operate a shopping center. In addition, the Company has non cancelable operating leases pertaining to its retail store lease portfolio. The following table summarizes the Companys debt maturities and obligations under non cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2002 (in millions): 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter Total Long Term Debt $ 147.3 $ 223.9 $ 221.3 $ 118.8 $ 206.1 $ 659.6 $1,577.0 Operating Leases Ground Leases $ 10.9 $ 10.8 $ 10.1 $ 9.5 $ 9.0 $ 125.1 $ 175.4 Retail Store Leases $ 9.5 $ 8.5 $ 7.3 $ 5.8 $ 3.9 $ 4.2 $ 39.2 The Company has $100.0 million of unsecured senior notes and $7.3 million of construction loans maturing in 2003. In addition, the Companys unsecured revolving credit facility, which is scheduled to mature in August 2003, had $40.0 million outstanding as of December 2002. The Company anticipates satisfying these maturities with a combination of operating cash flows, its unsecured revolving credit facility and new debt financings. The Company intends to renew its unsecured revolving credit facility prior to the maturity date. The Company has issued letters of credit in connection with the collateralization of tax exempt mortgage bonds, completion guarantees for certain construction projects, and guaranty of payment related to the Companys insurance program. These letters of credit aggregate approximately $14.9 million. Additionally, the RioCan Venture, an entity in which the Company holds a 50% non controlling interest, has a CAD $5.0 million (approximately USD $3.2 million) letter of credit facility. This facility is jointly guaranteed by RioCan and the Company and has approximately CAD $1.0 million (approximately USD $0.6 million) outstanding as of December 31, 2002 relating to various development projects. During 2002, the Company obtained construction financing on eight ground up development properties for an aggregate loan amount of up to $119.8 million. As of December 31, 2002, approximately $38.9 million was outstanding. Unconsolidated Real Estate Joint Ventures The Company has investments in a number of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures with varying structures. These investments include the Companys 43.3% non controlling interest in KIR, the Companys 50% non controlling interest in the RioCan Venture, the Companys 20% non controlling interest in KROP, and varying interests in other real estate joint ventures. These joint ventures operate either shopping center properties or are established for development projects. Such arrangements are generally with third party institutional investors, local developers and individuals. The properties owned by the joint ventures are primarily financed with individual non recourse mortgage loans. Non recourse mortgage debt is generally defined as debt whereby the lenders sole recourse with respect to borrower defaults is limited to the value of the property collateralized by the mortgage. The lender generally does not have recourse against any other assets owned by the borrower or any of the constituent members of the borrower, except for certain specified exceptions listed in the particular loan documents. The KIR joint venture was established for the purpose of investing in high quality real estate properties financed primarily with individual non recourse mortgages. The Company believes that these properties are appropriate for financing with greater leverage than the Company traditionally uses. As of December 31, 2002, KIR had interests in 68 properties comprising 14.0 million square feet of GLA. As of December 31, 2002, KIR had obtained individual non recourse mortgage loans on 67 of these properties aggregating approximately $1,103.7 million. These non recourse mortgage loans have maturities ranging from one to 16 years and rates ranging from 5.95% to 8.52%. In addition, KIR maintains a secured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks, which is scheduled to expire in November 2003. This facility is collateralized by the unfunded subscriptions of certain partners, including those of the Company. The facility has an aggregate availability of up to $100.0 million based upon the amount of unfunded subscription commitments of certain partners. During January 2003, the aggregate availability under the credit facility was reduced to $90.0 million. Under the terms of the facility, funds may be borrowed for general corporate purposes including the acquisition of institutional quality properties. Borrowings under the facility accrue interest at Libor plus 0.80%. As of December 31, 2002, there was $15.0 million outstanding under this facility. As of December 31, 2002, the Companys pro rata share of non recourse mortgages and other debt obligations relating to the KIR joint venture was approximately $484.4 million. The Company also has unfunded capital commitments to KIR in the amount of approximately $55.9 million as of December 31, 2002. (See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K.) 42 The RioCan Venture was established with RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust to acquire properties and development projects in Canada. As of December 31, 2002, the RioCan Venture consisted of 28 shopping center properties and four development projects with approximately 6.7 million square feet of GLA. As of December 31, 2002, the RioCan Venture had obtained individual, non recourse mortgage loans on 26 of these properties aggregating approximately CAD $519.1 million (USD $329.3 million). These non recourse mortgage loans have maturities ranging from one to 12 years and rates ranging from 5.82% to 10.31%. As of December 31, 2002 the Companys pro rata share of non recourse mortgage loans relating to the RioCan Venture was approximately CAD $259.6 million (USD $164.6 million). (See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K.) The Kimco Retail Opportunity Fund ("KROP"), a joint venture with GE Capital Real Estate ("GECRE") was established to acquire high growth potential retail properties in the United States. As of December 31, 2002, KROP consisted of 15 shopping center properties with approximately 1.5 million square feet of GLA. During 2002, KROP obtained a cross collateralized mortgage with a 5 year term aggregating $73.0 million on eight properties with an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.8%. During 2002, $1.9 million of this mortgage was repaid upon the sale of one of the collateralized properties. The interest on this mortgage is payable in monthly installments with principal due in full upon maturity. Additionally, KROP assumed mortgage debt of approximately $29.5 million in connection with the acquisition of three shopping centers, with fixed interest rates ranging from 7.38% to 8.64%. Such mortgage debt is collateralized by the individual shopping center property and is payable in monthly installments of principal and interest. At December 31, 2002 the weighted average interest rate for all mortgage debt outstanding was 4.65% per annum. As of December 31, 2002, the Companys pro rata share of non recourse mortgage loans relating to the KROP joint venture was approximately $20.0 million. Additionally, the Company along with its joint venture partner have provided interim financing ("Short term Notes") for all acquisitions without a mortgage in place at the time of closing. As of December 31, 2002 KROP has outstanding Short term Notes of $17.3 million due each the Company and GECRE. These short term notes all have maturities of less than one year with rates ranging from Libor plus 4.0% to 4.25%. (See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K.) The Company has various other unconsolidated real estate joint ventures with ownership interests ranging from 4% to 50%. As of December 31, 2002, these unconsolidated joint ventures had individual non recourse mortgage loans aggregating approximately $187.9 million. The Companys pro rata share of these non recourse mortgages was approximately $78.9 million. (See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K.) Other Real Estate Investments During November 2002, the Company, through its taxable REIT subsidiary, together with Prometheus Southeast Retail Trust, completed the merger and privatization of Konover Property Trust, which has been renamed Kimsouth Realty, Inc., ("Kimsouth"). The Company acquired 44.5% of the common stock of Kimsouth, which consisted primarily of 38 retail shopping center properties comprising approximately 17.4 million square feet of GLA. Total acquisition value was approximately $280.9 million including approximately $216.2 million in mortgage debt. On December 23, 2002, Kimsouth obtained a cross collateralized three year mortgage, aggregating $21.3 million at a variable rate of Libor plus 3.0% which replaced (i) a secured line of credit for $8.0 million and (ii) a construction loan for $17.6 million. All mortgages, which are collateralized by the individual shopping center properties, are due in monthly installments. The scheduled maturities of all mortgages payable as of December 31, 2002, are approximately as follows (in millions): 2003: $74.7; 2004: $2.9; 2005: $30.3; 2006: $3.2; 2007: $45.3 and thereafter, $28.6. At December 31, 2002, the weighted average interest rate for all mortgage debt outstanding was 7.47% per annum. During June 2002, the Company acquired a 90% equity participation interest in an existing leveraged lease of 30 properties. The properties are leased under a long term bond type net lease whose primary term expires in 2016, with the lessee having certain renewal option rights. The Companys cash equity investment was approximately $4.0 million. This equity investment is reported as a net investment in leveraged lease in accordance with SFAS No. 13 (as amended). The net investment in leveraged lease reflects the original cash investment adjusted by remaining net rentals, estimated unguaranteed residual value, unearned and deferred income, and deferred taxes relating to the investment. 43 As of December 31, 2002, four of these properties were sold whereby the proceeds from the sales were used to paydown the mortgage debt by approximately $9.6 million. As of December 31, 2002, the remaining 26 properties were encumbered by third party non recourse debt of approximately $86.0 million that is scheduled to fully amortize during the primary term of the lease from a portion of the periodic net rents receivable under the net lease. As an equity participant in the leveraged lease, the Company has no general obligation for principal or interest payments on the debt, which is collateralized by a first mortgage lien on the properties and collateral assignment of the lease. Accordingly, this debt has been offset against the related net rental receivable under the lease. Effects of Inflation Many of the Companys leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. Such provisions include clauses enabling the Company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants gross sales above pre determined thresholds, which generally increase as prices rise, and or escalation clauses, which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases. Such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices. In addition, many of the Companys leases are for terms of less than 10 years, which permits the Company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal. Most of the Companys leases require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance, thereby reducing the Companys exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. The Company periodically evaluates its exposure to short term interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and will, from time to time, enter into interest rate protection agreements and or foreign currency hedge agreements which mitigate, but do not eliminate, the effect of changes in interest rates on its floating rate debt and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. New Accounting Pronouncements In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets ("FASB No. 144"), which supercedes SFAS No. 121. FASB No. 144 requires that long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale be measured at the lower of book value or fair value less cost to sell. FASB No. 144 retains the requirements of SFAS No. 121 regarding impairment loss recognition and measurement. In addition, it requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. FASB No. 144 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted FASB No. 144. The impact of adoption of FASB No. 144 did not have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB No. 13 and Technical Corrections ("FASB No. 145"). This statement eliminates the requirement to report gains and losses from extinguishment of debt as extraordinary unless they meet the criteria of APB Opinion 30. Debt extinguishments that were classified as extraordinary in prior periods presented that do not meet the criteria of APB Opinion 30 shall be reclassified. FASB No. 145 is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. During 2002, the Company elected early adoption of the provisions of FASB No. 145. The impact of adopting this statement did not have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities ("FASB 146"). This statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). For purpose of this statement, an exit or disposal activity is initiated when management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to an exit or disposal plan or otherwise disposes of a long lived asset (disposal group) and, if the activity involves the termination of employees, the criteria for a plan of termination of this statement are met. The provisions of this statement shall be effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The impact of the adoption of FASB No. 146 is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45 ("FIN 45"), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57 and 107 and rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34). FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of FASB Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. It requires that upon issuance of a guarantee, the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee regardless of whether or not the guarantor receives separate identifiable consideration (i.e., a premium). The Company has adopted the new disclosure requirements, which are effective beginning with 2002 calendar year end financials. FIN 45s provisions for initial recognition and measurement are effective on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The adoption of FIN 45 is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. 44 In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123 ("FASB No. 148"). This Statement amends FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The transition and annual disclosure provision of FASB No. 148 shall be applied for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. The new interim disclosure provisions are effective for the first interim period beginning after December 15, 2002. Effective January 1, 2003, the Company will adopt the prospective method provisions of FASB No. 148, which will apply the recognition provisions of FASB No. 123 to all employee awards granted, modified or settled after January 1, 2003. The adoption is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Companys results of operations. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("FIN 46"), the primary objective of which is to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights ("variable interest entities" or "VIEs") and to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the VIE (the "primary beneficiary"). This new model applies when either (i) the equity investors (if any) do not have a controlling financial interest or (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entitys activities without additional financial support. In addition, FIN 46 requires additional disclosures. The Company is assessing the impact of this interpretation on its accounting for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures (see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K). Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As of December 31, 2002, the Company had approximately $280.0 million of floating rate debt outstanding including $40.0 million on its unsecured revolving credit facility. The interest rate risk on $185.0 million of such debt has been mitigated through the use of interest rate swap agreements (the "Swaps") with major financial institutions. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by the counter party to the Swaps. The Company believes it mitigates its credit risk by entering into these Swaps with major financial institutions. The Company believes the interest rate risk represented by the remaining $95.0 million of floating rate debt is not material to the Company or its overall capitalization. As of December 31, 2002, the Company has Canadian investments totaling CAD $204.5 million (approximately USD $130.2 million) comprised of marketable securities and a real estate joint venture. In addition, the Company has Mexican real estate investments of MXN $383.7 million (approximately USD $35.7 million). The foreign currency exchange risk has been mitigated through the use of foreign currency forward contracts (the "Forward Contracts") and a cross currency swap (the "CC Swap") with major financial institutions. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by the counter party to the Forward Contracts and the CC Swap. The Company believes it mitigates its credit risk by entering into the Forward Contracts and the CC Swap with major financial institutions. The Company has not, and does not plan to, enter into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had no other material exposure to market risk.
