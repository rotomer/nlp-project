Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in this annual report on Form 10 K. Historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the Consolidated Statements of Income contained in the Consolidated Financial Statements, including trends which might appear, should not be taken as indicative of future operations. Executive Summary Kimco Realty Corporation is one of the nations largest publicly traded owners and operators of neighborhood and community shopping centers. As of February 5, 2004, the Companys portfolio was comprised of 699 property interests, including 620 shopping center properties (including 26 property interests relating to the Companys Preferred Equity program), 36 retail store leases, 33 ground up development projects and ten undeveloped parcels of land, totaling approximately 102.6 million square feet of leasable space (including 3.9 million square feet related to the Companys Preferred Equity program and 4.9 million square feet projected for the ground up development projects) located in 41 states, Canada and Mexico. The Company is self administered and self managed through present management, which has owned and managed neighborhood and community shopping centers for over 40 years. The executive officers are engaged in the day to day management and operation of real estate exclusively with the Company, with nearly all operating functions, including leasing, asset management, maintenance, construction, legal, finance and accounting administered by the Company. Additionally, in connection with the Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999 (the "RMA"), which became effective January 1, 2001, the Company is now permitted to participate in activities which it was precluded from previously in order to maintain its qualification as a Real Estate Investment Trust ("REIT"), so long as these activities are conducted in entities which elect to be treated as taxable subsidiaries under the Code, subject to certain limitations. As such, the Company, through its taxable REIT subsidiaries, is engaged in various retail real estate related opportunities including (i) merchant building, through its Kimco Developers, Inc. ("KDI") subsidiary, which is primarily engaged in the ground up development of neighborhood and community shopping centers and the subsequent sale thereof upon completion (ii) retail real estate advisory and disposition services which primarily focuses on leasing and disposition strategies of retail real estate controlled by both healthy and distressed and or bankrupt retailers and (iii) acting as an agent or principal in connection with tax deferred exchange transactions. The Company will consider other investments through taxable REIT subsidiaries should suitable opportunities arise. The Companys strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet while investing opportunistically and selectively. The Company intends to continue to execute its plan of delivering solid growth in earnings and dividends. As a result of the improved 2003 performance, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend to $0.57 from $0.54 effective for the first quarter of 2004. Critical Accounting Policies The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company include the accounts of the Company, its wholly owned subsidiaries and all partnerships in which the Company has a controlling interest. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. These estimates are based on, but not limited to, historical results, industry standards and current economic conditions, giving due consideration to materiality. The most significant assumptions and estimates relate to revenue recognition and the recoverability of trade accounts receivable, depreciable lives and valuation of real estate. Application of these assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. 33 Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable Base rental revenues from rental property are recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the related leases. Certain of these leases also provide for percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the lessee. These percentage rents are recorded once the required sales level is achieved. In addition, leases typically provide for reimbursement to the Company of common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other operating expenses. Operating expense reimbursements are recognized as earned. Rental income may also include payments received in connection with lease termination agreements. The Company makes estimates of the uncollectability of its accounts receivable related to base rents, expense reimbursements and other revenues. The Company analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels, customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and estimates are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre petition and post petition claims. The Companys reported net income is directly affected by managements estimate of the collectability of accounts receivable. Real Estate Upon acquisition of operating real estate properties, the Company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, building and improvements) and identified intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above and below market leases, in place leases and tenant relationships) and assumed debt in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations ("SFAS No. 141"). Based on these estimates, the Company allocates the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities. The Company utilized methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. The useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are evaluated each reporting period with any changes in estimated useful lives being accounted for over the revised remaining useful life. The Companys investments in real estate properties are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Significant renovations and replacements, which improve and extend the life of the asset, are capitalized. Depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows: Buildings 15 to 46 years Fixtures, building and leasehold improvements Terms of leases or useful (including certain identified intangible assets) lives, whichever is shorter The Company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties. These assessments have a direct impact on the Companys net income. Real estate under development on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets represent ground up development projects which are held for sale upon completion. These assets are carried at cost and no depreciation is recorded. The cost of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. The Company ceases cost capitalization when the property is held available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from the completion of major construction activity. If in managements opinion, the estimated net sales price of these assets is less than the net carrying value, an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. A gain on the sale of these assets is generally recognized using the full accrual method in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 66, Accounting for Real Estate Sales. Long Lived Assets On a periodic basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may be impaired. A property value is considered impaired only if managements estimate of current and projected operating cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the property over its remaining useful life is less than the net carrying value of the property. Such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income, trend and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. To the extent impairment has occurred, the carrying value of the property would be adjusted to an amount to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. 34 When a real estate asset is identified by management as held for sale the Company ceases depreciation of the asset and estimates the sales price of such asset net of selling costs. If, in managements opinion, the net sales price of the asset is less than the net book value of such asset, an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. The Company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate properties, investments in joint ventures and other investments. The Companys reported net income is directly affected by managements estimate of impairments and or valuation allowances. Results of Operations Comparison 2003 to 2002 Revenues from rental property increased $46.9 million or 10.8% to $479.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared with $432.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This net increase resulted primarily from the combined effect of (i) the acquisition of 55 operating properties during 2003, including 41 operating properties acquired in the Mid Atlantic Merger, providing revenues of $34.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, (ii) the full year impact related to the 13 operating properties acquired in 2002 providing incremental revenues of $16.6 million, and (iii) an overall increase in shopping center portfolio occupancy to 90.7% at December 31, 2003 as compared to 87.8% at December 31, 2002 and the completion of certain development and redevelopment projects, providing incremental revenues of approximately $18.1 million as compared to the corresponding year ended December 31, 2002, offset by (iv) a decrease in revenues of approximately $8.4 million resulting from the bankruptcy filing of Kmart Corporation ("Kmart") and subsequent rejection of leases, and (v) sales of certain development properties and tenant buyouts resulting in a decrease of revenues of approximately $13.6 million as compared to the preceding year. Rental property expenses including depreciation and amortization increased $25.7 million or 13.8% to $212.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $187.0 million for the preceding year. The rental property expense components of operating and maintenance and depreciation and amortization increased approximately $24.8 million or 21.5% for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase is primarily due to property acquisitions during 2003 and 2002 and increased snow removal costs during 2003. Income from other real estate investments increased $6.8 million to $22.8 million as compared to $16.0 million for the preceding year. This increase is primarily due to increased investment in the Companys preferred equity program contributing $4.6 million during 2003 as compared to $1.0 million in 2002, contribution of $12.1 million from the Kimsouth investment resulting from the disposition of 14 investment properties during 2003, offset by a decrease in income of $7.8 million from the Montgomery Ward Asset Designation rights transaction. Management and other fee income increased approximately $3.2 million to $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase is primarily due to (i) increased management and acquisition fees resulting from the growth of the KROP portfolio, (ii) increased management fees from KIR resulting from the growth of the KIR portfolio, and (iii) increased property management activity providing incremental fee income of approximately $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to the preceding year. Interest expense increased $17.4 million or 20.4% to $102.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared with $85.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase is primarily due to an overall increase in borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to the preceding year, including additional borrowings and assumption of mortgage debt totaling approximately $616.0 million in connection with the Mid Atlantic Merger. General and administrative expenses increased approximately $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the preceding calendar year. This increase is primarily due to (i) increased staff levels related to the growth of the Company, and (ii) other personnel related costs, associated with a realignment of our regional operations. 35 During 2003, the Company reached agreement with certain lenders in connection with three individual non recourse mortgages encumbering three former Kmart sites. The Company paid approximately $14.2 million in full satisfaction of these loans which aggregated approximately $24.0 million. As a result of these transactions, the Company recognized a gain on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $9.7 million during 2003. During December 2002, the Company reached agreement with certain lenders in connection with four individual non recourse mortgages encumbering four former Kmart sites. The Company paid approximately $24.2 million in full satisfaction of these loans which aggregated approximately $46.5 million. The Company recognized a gain on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $22.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. As part of the Companys periodic assessment of its real estate properties with regard to both the extent to which such assets are consistent with the Companys long term real estate investment objectives and the performance and prospects of each asset, the Company determined in 2002, that its investment in four operating properties, comprised of an aggregate 0.4 million square feet of GLA with an aggregate net book value of approximately $23.8 million, may not be fully recoverable. Based upon managements assessment of current market conditions and the lack of demand for the properties, the Company has reduced its potential holding period of these investments. As a result of the reduction in the anticipated holding period, together with a reassessment of the projected future operating cash flows of the properties and the effects of current market conditions, the Company has determined that its investment in these assets was not fully recoverable and has recorded an adjustment of property carrying value aggregating approximately $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Approximately $1.5 million relating to the adjustment of property carrying value for one of these properties is included in the caption Income from discontinued operations on the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income. Provision for income taxes decreased $4.4 million to $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared with $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease is primarily due to less taxable income provided by the Montgomery Ward Asset Designation Rights transaction in 2003 as compared to 2002. Equity in income of real estate joint ventures, net increased $4.6 million to $42.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to $37.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase is primarily attributable to the equity in income from the Kimco Income REIT joint venture investment, the RioCan joint venture investment, and the KROP joint venture investment as described below. During 1998, the Company formed KIR, a limited partnership established to invest in high quality retail properties financed primarily through the use of individual non recourse mortgages. The Company has a 43.3% non controlling limited partnership interest in KIR, which the Company manages, and accounts for its investment in KIR under the equity method of accounting. Equity in income of KIR increased $1.6 million to $19.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to $18.2 million for the preceding year. This increase is primarily due to the Companys increased capital investment in KIR totaling $13.0 million during 2003 and $23.8 million during 2002. The additional capital investments received by KIR from the Company and its other institutional partners were used to purchase additional shopping center properties throughout calendar year 2003 and 2002. During October 2001, the Company formed a joint venture (the "RioCan Venture") with RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust ("RioCan", Canadas largest publicly traded REIT measured by gross leasable area ("GLA")), in which the Company has a 50% non controlling interest, to acquire retail properties and development projects in Canada. As of December 31, 2003, the RioCan Venture consisted of 31 shopping center properties and three development projects with approximately 7.2 million square feet of GLA. The Companys equity in income from the RioCan Venture increased approximately $3.4 million to $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to $9.1 million for the preceding year. During October 2001, the Company formed the Kimco Retail Opportunity Portfolio ("KROP"), a joint venture with GE Capital Real Estate ("GECRE") which the Company manages and has a 20% non controlling interest. The purpose of this venture is to acquire established, high growth potential retail properties in the United States. As of December 31, 2003, KROP consisted of 23 shopping center properties with approximately 3.5 million square feet of GLA. The Companys equity in income from the KROP Venture increased approximately $1.0 million to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to $1.0 million for the preceding year. 36 Minority interests in income of partnerships, net increased $5.5 million to $7.9 million as compared to $2.4 million for the preceding year. This increase is primarily due to the full year effect of the acquisition of a shopping center property acquired during October 2002, through a newly formed partnership by issuing approximately 2.4 million downREIT units valued at $80 million. The downREIT units are convertible at a ratio of 1:1 into the Companys common stock and are entitled to a distribution equal to the dividend rate on the Companys common stock multiplied by 1.1057. During 2003, the Company disposed of, in separate transactions, (i) 10 operating shopping center properties, for an aggregate sales price of approximately $119.1 million, including the assignment of approximately $1.7 million of mortgage debt encumbering one of the properties, (ii) two regional malls for an aggregate sales price of approximately $135.6 million, (iii) one out parcel for a sales price of approximately $8.1 million, (iv) transferred three operating properties to KROP for a price of approximately $144.2 million which approximated their net book value, (v) transferred an operating property to a newly formed joint venture in which the Company has a non controlling 10% interest for a price of approximately $21.9 million which approximated its net book value and (vi) terminated four leasehold positions in locations which a tenant in bankruptcy had rejected its lease. These transactions resulted in net gains of approximately $50.8 million. For those property dispositions for which SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets ("SFAS No. 144") is applicable, the operations and gain or loss on the sale of the property have been included in the caption Discontinued operations on the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income. During 2003, the Company identified two operating properties, comprised of approximately 0.2 million square feet of GLA, as "Held for Sale" in accordance with SFAS No. 144. The book value of these properties, aggregating approximately $19.5 million, net of accumulated depreciation of approximately $2.0 million, exceeded their estimated fair value. The Companys determination of the fair value of these properties, aggregating approximately $15.4 million, is based upon contracts of sale with third parties less estimated selling costs. As a result, the Company recorded an adjustment of property carrying values of $4.0 million. This adjustment is included, along with the related property operations for the current and comparative years, in the caption Income from discontinued operations on the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income. During 2002, the Company identified two operating properties, comprised of approximately 0.2 million square feet of GLA, as "Held for Sale" in accordance with SFAS No. 144. The book value of these properties, aggregating approximately $28.4 million, net of accumulated depreciation of approximately $2.9 million, exceeded their estimated fair value. The Companys determination of the fair value of these properties, aggregating approximately $7.9 million, is based upon executed contracts of sale with third parties less estimated selling costs. As a result, the Company recorded an adjustment of property carrying values of $20.5 million. This adjustment is included, along with the related property operations for the current and comparative years, in the caption Income from discontinued operations on the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income. Effective January 1, 2001, the Company has elected taxable REIT subsidiary status for its wholly owned development subsidiary, KDI. KDI is primarily engaged in the ground up development of neighborhood and community shopping centers and the subsequent sale thereof upon completion. During the year ended December 31, 2003, KDI sold four projects and 26 out parcels, in separate transactions, for approximately $134.6 million. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of approximately $17.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2002, KDI sold four of its recently completed projects and eight out parcels, in separate transactions, for approximately $128.7 million, including the assignment of approximately $17.7 million of mortgage debt encumbering one of the properties which resulted in pre tax profits of $15.9 million. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $307.9 million as compared to $245.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. On a diluted per share basis, net income increased $0.46 to $2.62 for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $2.16 for the preceding year. This improved performance is primarily attributable to (i) the acquisition of operating properties, including the Mid Atlantic Merger, during 2003 and 2002, (ii) significant leasing within the portfolio which improved operating profitability, (iii) increased contributions from KIR, the RioCan Venture and KROP, (iv) increased gains on development sales from KDI, and (v) increased gains from operating property sales of $50.8 million in 2003 as compared to $12.8 million in 2002. The 2003 improvement also includes the impact from gains on early extinguishment of debt of $9.7 million in 2003 as compared to $22.3 million in 2002 and adjustments to property carrying values of $4.0 million in 2003 and $33.0 million in 2002. The 2003 diluted per share results were decreased by a reduction in net income available to common shareholders of $0.07 resulting from the deduction of original issuance costs associated with the redemption of the Companys 7 3/4% Class A, 8 1/2% Class B and 8 3/8% Class C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stocks during the second quarter of 2003. 37 Comparison 2002 to 2001 Revenues from rental property increased $1.3 million or 0.3% to $432.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared with $431.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This net increase resulted primarily from the combined effect of (i) the acquisition of 13 operating properties during 2002, providing revenues of $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, (ii) the full year impact related to the three operating properties acquired in 2001 providing incremental revenues of $2.3 million, and (iii) the completion of certain development and redevelopment projects, tenant buyouts and new leasing within the portfolio providing incremental revenues of approximately $20.5 million as compared to the corresponding year ended December 31, 2001, offset by (iv) an overall decrease in shopping center portfolio occupancy to 87.8% at December 31, 2002 as compared to 90.4% at December 31, 2001 due primarily to the bankruptcy filing of Kmart Corporation ("Kmart") and Ames Department Stores, Inc. ("Ames") and subsequent rejection of leases resulting in a decrease of revenues of approximately $24.2 million as compared to the preceding year, and (v) sales of certain shopping center properties throughout 2001 and 2002, resulting in a decrease of revenues of approximately $2.4 million as compared to the preceding year. Rental property expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased $10.2 million or 5.8% to $187.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $176.8 million for the preceding year. The rental property expense component of real estate taxes increased approximately $6.4 million or 11.8% for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2001. This increase relates primarily to the payment of real estate taxes by the Company on certain Kmart anchored locations where Kmart previously paid the real estate taxes directly to the taxing authorities. The rental property expense component of operating and maintenance increased approximately $1.7 million or 4.1% for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2001. This increase is primarily due to property acquisitions during 2002 and 2001, renovations within the portfolio and higher professional fees relating to tenant bankruptcies. Income from other real estate investments decreased $22.1 million to $16.0 million as compared to $38.1 million for the preceding year. This decrease is primarily due to the decrease in income from the Montgomery Ward asset designation rights transactions described below. During March 2001, the Company, through a taxable REIT subsidiary, formed a real estate joint venture (the "Ward Venture") in which the Company has a 50% interest, for purposes of acquiring asset designation rights for substantially all of the real estate property interests of the bankrupt estate of Montgomery Ward LLC and its affiliates. These asset designation rights have provided the Ward Venture the ability to direct the ultimate disposition of the 315 fee and leasehold interests held by the bankrupt estate, of which 303 transactions were completed as of December 31, 2002. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Ward Venture completed transactions for 32 properties. The pre tax profits from the Ward Venture decreased approximately $23.3 million to $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $34.6 million for the preceding year. Mortgage financing income increased $16.8 million to $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This increase is primarily due to increased interest income earned related to certain real estate lending activities during the year ended December 31, 2002. Management and other fee income increased approximately $5.7 million to $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This increase is primarily due to (i) a $0.6 million increase in management fees from KIR resulting from the growth of the KIR portfolio, (ii) $2.1 million of management and acquisition fees relating to the KROP joint venture activities during the year ended December 31, 2002 and (iii) increased property management activity providing incremental fee income of approximately $3.0 million. Other income/(expense), net increased approximately $4.7 million to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to the preceding calendar year. This increase is primarily due to pre tax profits earned from the Companys participation in ventures established to provide inventory liquidation services to regional retailers in bankruptcy. 38 Interest expense decreased $1.7 million or 1.9% to $85.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared with $87.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This decrease is primarily due to reduced interest costs on the Companys floating rate revolving credit facilities and remarketed reset notes which was partially offset by an increase in borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to the preceding year. General and administrative expenses increased approximately $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to the preceding calendar year. This increase is primarily due to higher costs related to the growth of the Company including (i) increased senior management and staff levels, (ii) increased system related costs and (iii) other personnel related costs. The Company had previously encumbered certain Kmart sites with individual non recourse mortgages as part of its strategy to reduce its exposure to Kmart Corporation. As a result of the Kmart bankruptcy filing in January 2002 and the subsequent rejection of leases including leases at these encumbered sites, the Company, during July 2002, had suspended debt services payments on these loans and was actively negotiating with the respective lenders. During December 2002, the Company reached agreement with certain lenders in connection with four of these locations. The Company paid approximately $24.2 million in full satisfaction of these loans which aggregated approximately $46.5 million. The Company recognized a gain on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $22.3 million. As part of the Companys periodic assessment of its real estate properties with regard to both the extent to which such assets are consistent with the Companys long term real estate investment objectives and the performance and prospects of each asset, the Company determined in 2002, that its investment in four operating properties, comprised of an aggregate 0.4 million square feet of GLA with an aggregate net book value of approximately $23.8 million, may not be fully recoverable. Based upon managements assessment of current market conditions and the lack of demand for the properties, the Company has reduced its potential holding period of these investments. As a result of the reduction in the anticipated holding period, together with a reassessment of the projected future operating cash flows of the properties and the effects of current market conditions, the Company has determined that its investment in these assets was not fully recoverable and has recorded an adjustment of property carrying value aggregating approximately $12.5 million, of which approximately $1.5 million is included in the caption Income from discontinued operations on the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income. Equity in income of real estate joint ventures, net increased $16.0 million to $37.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to $21.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This increase is primarily attributable to the equity in income from the Kimco Income REIT joint venture investment, the RioCan joint venture investment, and the KROP joint venture investment as described below. During 1998, the Company formed KIR, a limited partnership established to invest in high quality retail properties financed primarily through the use of individual non recourse mortgages. The Company has a 43.3% non controlling limited partnership interest in KIR, which the Company manages, and accounts for its investment in KIR under the equity method of accounting. Equity in income of KIR increased $3.5 million to $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to $14.7 million for the preceding year. This increase is primarily due to the Companys increased capital investment in KIR totaling $23.8 million during 2002 and $30.8 million during 2001. The additional capital investments received by KIR from the Company and its other institutional partners were used to purchase additional shopping center properties throughout calendar year 2002 and 2001. During October 2001, the Company formed a joint venture (the "RioCan Venture") with RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust ("RioCan", Canadas largest publicly traded REIT measured by gross leasable area ("GLA")), in which the Company has a 50% non controlling interest, to acquire retail properties and development projects in Canada. As of December 31, 2002, the RioCan Venture consisted of 28 shopping center properties and four development projects with approximately 6.7 million square feet of GLA. The Companys equity in income from the RioCan Venture increased approximately $8.7 million to $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to $0.4 million for the preceding year. During October 2001, the Company formed the Kimco Retail Opportunity Portfolio ("KROP"), a joint venture with GE Capital Real Estate ("GECRE") which the Company manages and has a 20% non controlling interest. The purpose of this venture is to acquire established, high growth potential retail properties in the United States. As of December 31, 2002, KROP consisted of 15 shopping center properties with approximately 1.5 million square feet of GLA. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Companys equity in income from KROP was approximately $1.0 million. 39 Minority interests in income of partnerships, net increased $0.7 million to $2.4 million as compared to $1.7 million for the preceding year. This increase is primarily due to the acquisition of a shopping center property acquired through a newly formed partnership by issuing approximately 2.4 million downREIT units valued at $80 million. The downREIT units are convertible at a ratio of 1:1 into the Companys common stock and are entitled to a distribution equal to the dividend rate on the Companys common stock multiplied by 1.1057. During 2002, the Company identified two operating properties, comprised of approximately 0.2 million square feet of GLA, as "Held for Sale" in accordance with SFAS No. 144. The book value of these properties, aggregating approximately $28.4 million, net of accumulated depreciation of approximately $2.9 million, exceeded their estimated fair value. The Companys determination of the fair value of these properties, aggregating approximately $7.9 million, is based upon executed contracts of sale with third parties less estimated selling costs. As a result, the Company recorded an adjustment of property carrying values of $20.5 million. This adjustment is included, along with the related property operations for the current and comparative years, in the caption Income from discontinued operations on the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income. During 2002, the Company, (i) disposed of, in separate transactions, 12 operating properties for an aggregate sales price of approximately $74.5 million, including the assignment/repayment of approximately $22.6 million of mortgage debt encumbering three of the properties and, (ii) terminated five leasehold positions in locations where a tenant in bankruptcy had rejected its lease. These dispositions resulted in net gains of approximately $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets ("SFAS No. 144"), the operations and net gain on disposition of these properties have been included in the caption Discontinued operations on the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income. During 2001, the Company, in separate transactions, disposed of three operating properties, including the sale of a property to KIR, and a portion of another operating property comprising in the aggregate approximately 0.6 million square feet of GLA. Cash proceeds from these dispositions aggregated approximately $46.7 million, which resulted in a net gain of approximately $3.0 million. Cash proceeds from the sale of the operating property in Elyria, OH totaling $5.8 million, together with an additional $7.1 million cash investment, were used to acquire an exchange shopping center property located in Lakeland, FL during August 2001. Effective January 1, 2001, the Company has elected taxable REIT subsidiary status for its wholly owned development subsidiary ("KDI"). KDI is primarily engaged in the ground up development of neighborhood and community shopping centers and the subsequent sale thereof upon completion. During the year ended December 31, 2002, KDI sold four projects and eight out parcels, in separate transactions, for approximately $128.7 million, including the assignment of approximately $17.7 million of mortgage debt encumbering one of the properties. These sales resulted in pre tax gains of approximately $15.9 million. During the year ended December 31, 2001, KDI sold two of its recently completed projects and five out parcels, in separate transactions, for approximately $61.3 million, which resulted in pre tax profits of $13.4 million. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $245.7 million as compared to $236.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, representing an increase of $9.2 million. This increase reflects the combined effect of increased contributions from the investments in KIR, KROP, the RioCan Venture and other financing investments, reduced by lower income resulting from tenant bankruptcies and subsequent rejection of leases and a decrease in profits from the Ward Venture. Tenant Concentrations The Company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing risks through diversification achieved by the geographic distribution of its properties, avoiding dependence on any single property, and a large tenant base. At December 31, 2003, the Companys five largest tenants were The Home Depot, Kmart Corporation, Kohls, Royal Ahold, and TJX Companies, which represented approximately 3.0%, 2.9%, 2.8%, 2.6% and 2.5%, respectively, of the Companys annualized base rental revenues, including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the Company has less than a 100% economic interest. 40 On January 14, 2003, Kmart announced it would be closing 326 locations relating to its January 22, 2002 filing of protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Nine of these locations (excluding the KIR portfolio which includes three additional locations and Kimsouth which includes two additional locations) are leased from the Company. The annualized base rental revenues from these nine locations are approximately $4.3 million. As of December 31, 2003, Kmart rejected its lease at eight of these locations representing approximately $3.8 million of annualized base rental revenues. The Company has signed a lease at three of these sites, terminated its ground lease at another site, sold two properties and continues to negotiate leases with prospective tenants at the two remaining sites. Liquidity and Capital Resources It is managements intention that the Company continually have access to the capital resources necessary to expand and develop its business. As such, the Company intends to operate with and maintain a conservative capital structure with a level of debt to total market capitalization of 50% or less. As of December 31, 2003 the Companys level of debt to total market capitalization was 30%. In addition, the Company intends to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixed charge coverage ratios as part of its commitment to maintaining its investment grade debt ratings. The Company may, from time to time, seek to obtain funds through additional equity offerings, unsecured debt financings and or mortgage/construction loan financings and other debt and equity alternatives in a manner consistent with its intention to operate with a conservative debt structure. Since the completion of the Companys IPO in 1991, the Company has utilized the public debt and equity markets as its principal source of capital for its expansion needs. Since the IPO, the Company has completed additional offerings of its public unsecured debt and equity, raising in the aggregate over $3.3 billion for the purposes of, among other things, repaying indebtedness, acquiring interests in neighborhood and community shopping centers, funding ground up development projects, expanding and improving properties in the portfolio and other investments. The Company has a $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which is scheduled to expire in August 2006. This credit facility has made available funds to both finance the purchase of properties and other investments and meet any short term working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2003 there was $45.0 million outstanding under this credit facility. The Company also has a $400.0 million unsecured bridge facility, which is scheduled to expire in September 2004, with an option to extend up to $150.0 million for an additional year. Proceeds from this facility were used to partially fund the Mid Atlantic Realty Trust transaction. (See Recent Developments Mid Atlantic Realty Trust Merger and Notes 3 and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K.) As of December 31, 2003, there was $329.0 million outstanding on this unsecured bridge facility. The Company has a $300.0 million MTN program pursuant to which it may, from time to time, offer for sale its senior unsecured debt for any general corporate purposes, including (i) funding specific liquidity requirements in its business, including property acquisitions, development and redevelopment costs and (ii) managing the Companys debt maturities. (See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K.) In addition to the public equity and debt markets as capital sources, the Company may, from time to time, obtain mortgage financing on selected properties and construction loans to partially fund the capital needs of KDI, the Companys merchant building subsidiary. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had over 400 unencumbered property interests in its portfolio. During May 2003, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S 3 for up to $1.0 billion of debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock and common stock warrants. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had $609.7 million available for issuance under this shelf registration statement. In connection with its intention to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Company expects to continue paying regular dividends to its stockholders. These dividends will be paid from operating cash flows which are expected to increase due to property acquisitions, growth in operating income in the existing portfolio and from other investments. Since cash used to pay dividends reduces amounts available for capital investment, the Company generally intends to maintain a conservative dividend payout ratio, reserving such amounts as it considers necessary for the expansion and renovation of shopping centers in its portfolio, debt reduction, the acquisition of interests in new properties and other investments as suitable opportunities arise, and such other factors as the Board of Directors considers appropriate. Cash dividends paid increased to $246.3 million in 2003, compared to $235.6 million in 2002 and $209.8 million in 2001. 41 Although the Company receives substantially all of its rental payments on a monthly basis, it generally intends to continue paying dividends quarterly. Amounts accumulated in advance of each quarterly distribution will be invested by the Company in short term money market or other suitable instruments. The Company anticipates its capital commitment toward redevelopment projects during 2004 will be approximately $50.0 million to $75.0 million. Additionally, the Company anticipates its capital commitment toward ground up development during 2004 will be approximately $160.0 million to $200.0 million. The proceeds from the sales of development properties and proceeds from construction loans in 2004 should be sufficient to fund the ground up development capital requirements. The Company anticipates that cash flows from operations will continue to provide adequate capital to fund its operating and administrative expenses, regular debt service obligations and all dividend payments in accordance with REIT requirements in both the short term and long term. In addition, the Company anticipates that cash on hand, borrowings under its revolving credit facility, issuance of equity and public debt, as well as other debt and equity alternatives, will provide the necessary capital required by the Company. Cash flows from operations as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows was $308.6 million for 2003, $278.9 million for 2002 and $287.4 million for 2001. Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments The Company has debt obligations relating to its revolving credit facility, bridge facility, MTNs, senior notes, mortgages and construction loans with maturities ranging from less than one year to 20 years. As of December 31, 2003, the Companys total debt had a weighted average term to maturity of approximately 4.3 years. In addition, the Company has non cancelable operating leases pertaining to its shopping center portfolio. As of December 31, 2003, the Company has certain shopping center properties that are subject to long term ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to the Company to construct and or operate a shopping center. In addition, the Company has non cancelable operating leases pertaining to its retail store lease portfolio. The following table summarizes the Companys debt maturities and obligations under non cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2003 (in millions): 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total Long Term Debt $570.4 $244.6 $198.1 $207.6 $143.1 $791.2 $2,155.0 Operating Leases Ground Leases $ 11.3 $ 10.9 $ 10.2 $ 9.9 $ 8.9 $153.5 $ 204.7 Retail Store Leases $ 7.9 $ 7.7 $ 6.3 $ 4.4 $ 2.7 $ 2.8 $ 31.8 The Company has $50.0 million of unsecured senior notes, $135.0 million of medium term notes and $47.7 million of construction loans maturing in 2004. In addition, the Companys unsecured bridge facility, which is scheduled to expire in September 2004, with an option to extend up to $150.0 million for an additional year, had $329.0 million outstanding as of December 31, 2003. The Company anticipates satisfying these maturities with a combination of operating cash flows, its unsecured revolving credit facility and new debt financings. The Company has issued letters of credit in connection with the collateralization of tax exempt mortgage bonds, completion guarantees for certain construction projects, and guaranty of payment related to the Companys insurance program. These letters of credit aggregate approximately $15.3 million. Additionally, the RioCan Venture, an entity in which the Company holds a 50% non controlling interest, has a CAD $5.0 million (approximately USD $3.9 million) letter of credit facility. This facility is jointly guaranteed by RioCan and the Company and has approximately CAD $3.1 million (approximately USD $2.4 million) outstanding as of December 31, 2003 relating to various development projects. During 2003, the Company obtained construction financing on seven ground up development projects for an aggregate loan commitment amount of up to $152.2 million. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had 13 construction loans with total commitments of up to $238.9 million of which $92.8 million had been funded to the Company. These loans have maturities ranging from 3 to 34 months and interest rates ranging from 2.87% to 5.00% at December 31, 2003. 42 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Unconsolidated Real Estate Joint Ventures The Company has investments in various unconsolidated real estate joint ventures with varying structures. These investments include the Companys 43.3% non controlling interest in KIR, the Companys 50% non controlling interest in the RioCan Venture, the Companys 20% non controlling interest in KROP, and varying interests in other real estate joint ventures. These joint ventures operate either shopping center properties or are established for development projects. Such arrangements are generally with third party institutional investors, local developers and individuals. The properties owned by the joint ventures are primarily financed with individual non recourse mortgage loans. Non recourse mortgage debt is generally defined as debt whereby the lenders sole recourse with respect to borrower defaults is limited to the value of the property collateralized by the mortgage. The lender generally does not have recourse against any other assets owned by the borrower or any of the constituent members of the borrower, except for certain specified exceptions listed in the particular loan documents. The KIR joint venture was established for the purpose of investing in high quality real estate properties financed primarily with individual non recourse mortgages. The Company believes that these properties are appropriate for financing with greater leverage than the Company traditionally uses. As of December 31, 2003, KIR had interests in 70 properties comprising 14.6 million square feet of GLA. As of December 31, 2003, KIR had obtained individual non recourse mortgage loans on 68 of these properties. These non recourse mortgage loans have maturities ranging from 2 to 15 years and rates ranging from 3.23% to 8.52%. As of December 31, 2003, the Companys pro rata share of non recourse mortgages relating to the KIR joint venture was approximately $506.8 million. The Company also has unfunded capital commitments to KIR in the amount of approximately $42.9 million as of December 31, 2003. (See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K.) The RioCan Venture was established with RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust to acquire properties and development projects in Canada. As of December 31, 2003, the RioCan Venture consisted of 31 shopping center properties and three development projects with approximately 7.2 million square feet of GLA. As of December 31, 2003, the RioCan Venture had obtained individual, non recourse mortgage loans on 27 of these properties aggregating approximately CAD $590.6 million (USD $453.3 million). These non recourse mortgage loans have maturities ranging from five months to 11 years and rates ranging from 5.12% to 8.70%. As of December 31, 2003 the Companys pro rata share of non recourse mortgage loans relating to the RioCan Venture was approximately CAD $295.3 million (USD $226.7 million). (See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K.) The Kimco Retail Opportunity Portfolio ("KROP"), a joint venture with GE Capital Real Estate ("GECRE") was established to acquire high growth potential retail properties in the United States. As of December 31, 2003, KROP consisted of 23 shopping center properties with approximately 3.5 million square feet of GLA. As of December 31, 2003, KROP had non recourse mortgage loans totaling $295.1 million with fixed rates ranging from 4.25% to 8.64% and variable rates ranging from LIBOR plus 1.8% to LIBOR plus 2.5%. KROP has entered into a series of interest rate cap agreements to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on its variable rate mortgage agreements. Such mortgage debt is collateralized by the individual shopping center property and is payable in monthly installments of principal and interest. At December 31, 2003 the weighted average interest rate for all mortgage debt outstanding was 5.04% per annum. As of December 31, 2003, the Companys pro rata share of non recourse mortgage loans relating to the KROP joint venture was approximately $59.0 million. Additionally, the Company along with its joint venture partner have provided interim financing ("Short term Notes") for all acquisitions without a mortgage in place at the time of closing. As of December 31, 2003 KROP has outstanding Short term Notes of $16.8 million due each the Company and GECRE. These short term notes all have maturities of less than one year with rates ranging from LIBOR plus 4.0% to LIBOR plus 5.25%. (See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K.) The Company has various other unconsolidated real estate joint ventures with ownership interests ranging from 4% to 50%. As of December 31, 2003, these unconsolidated joint ventures had individual non recourse mortgage loans aggregating approximately $425.0 million. The Companys pro rata share of these non recourse mortgages was approximately $187.0 million. (See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K.) 43 Other Real Estate Investments During November 2002, the Company, through its taxable REIT subsidiary, together with Prometheus Southeast Retail Trust, completed the merger and privatization of Konover Property Trust, which has been renamed Kimsouth Realty, Inc., ("Kimsouth"). The Company acquired 44.5% of the common stock of Kimsouth, which consisted primarily of 38 retail shopping center properties comprising approximately 4.6 million square feet of GLA. Total acquisition value was approximately $280.9 million including approximately $216.2 million in mortgage debt. The Companys investment strategy with respect to Kimsouth includes re tenanting, repositioning and disposition of the properties. As a result of this strategy, Kimsouth has sold 16 properties as of December 31, 2003. The Kimsouth portfolio is comprised of 22 properties totaling 3.2 million square feet of GLA as of December 31, 2003 with non recourse mortgage debt of approximately $137.0 million encumbering the properties. All mortgages payable are collateralized by certain properties and are due in monthly installments. As of December 31, 2003, interest rates range from 2.88% to 9.22% and the weighted average interest rate for all mortgage debt outstanding was 5.71% per annum. As of December 31, 2003, the Companys pro rata share of non recourse mortgage loans relating to the Kimsouth portfolio was approximately $61.0 million. During June 2002, the Company acquired a 90% equity participation interest in an existing leveraged lease of 30 properties. The properties are leased under a long term bond type net lease whose primary term expires in 2016, with the lessee having certain renewal option rights. The Companys cash equity investment was approximately $4.0 million. This equity investment is reported as a net investment in leveraged lease in accordance with SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases (as amended). The net investment in leveraged lease reflects the original cash investment adjusted by remaining net rentals, estimated unguaranteed residual value, unearned and deferred income, and deferred taxes relating to the investment. As of December 31, 2003, eight of these properties were sold whereby the proceeds from the sales were used to paydown the mortgage debt by approximately $18.7 million. As of December 31, 2003, the remaining 22 properties were encumbered by third party non recourse debt of approximately $73.6 million that is scheduled to fully amortize during the primary term of the lease from a portion of the periodic net rents receivable under the net lease. As an equity participant in the leveraged lease, the Company has no recourse obligation for principal or interest payments on the debt, which is collateralized by a first mortgage lien on the properties and collateral assignment of the lease. Accordingly, this debt has been offset against the related net rental receivable under the lease. Effects of Inflation Many of the Companys leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. Such provisions include clauses enabling the Company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants gross sales above pre determined thresholds, which generally increase as prices rise, and or escalation clauses, which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases. Such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices. In addition, many of the Companys leases are for terms of less than 10 years, which permits the Company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal. Most of the Companys leases require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance, thereby reducing the Companys exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. The Company periodically evaluates its exposure to short term interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and will, from time to time, enter into interest rate protection agreements and or foreign currency hedge agreements which mitigate, but do not eliminate, the effect of changes in interest rates on its floating rate debt and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. New Accounting Pronouncements In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("FIN 46"), the primary objective of which is to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights ("variable interest entities" or "VIEs") and to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the VIE (the "primary beneficiary"). This new model applies when either (i) the equity investors (if any) do not have a controlling financial interest or (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entitys activities without additional financial support. In addition, effective upon issuance, FIN 46 requires additional disclosures by the primary beneficiary and other significant variable interest holders. The provisions of FIN 46 apply immediately to VIEs created after January 31, 2003. In October 2003, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 46 6, which deferred the effective date to December 31, 2003 for applying the provisions of FIN 46 for interests held by public companies in all VIEs created prior to February 1, 2003. Additionally, in December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (revised December 2003) ("FIN 46(R)"). The provisions of FIN 46(R) are effective as of March 31, 2004 for all non special purpose entity ("non SPE") interests held by public companies in all variable interest entities created prior to February 1, 2003. These deferral provisions did not defer the disclosure provisions of FIN 46(R). 44 The Company has evaluated its joint venture investments established after January 31, 2003 and based upon its interpretation of FIN 46 and applied judgment, the Company has determined that these joint venture investments are not VIEs and are not required to be consolidated. The Company continues to evaluate all of its investments in joint ventures created prior to February 1, 2003 to determine whether any of these entities are VIEs and whether the Company is considered to be the primary beneficiary or a holder of a significant variable interest in the VIE. If it is determined that certain of these entities are VIEs the Company will be required to consolidate those entities in which the Company is the primary beneficiary or make additional disclosures for entities in which the Company is determined to hold a significant variable interest in the VIE as of March 31, 2004. The Companys joint ventures and other real estate investments primarily consist of co investments with institutional and other joint venture partners in neighborhood and community shopping center properties, consistent with its core business. These joint ventures typically obtain non recourse third party financing on their property investments, thus contractually limiting the Companys losses to the amount of its equity investment, and due to the lenders exposure to losses, a lender typically will require a minimum level of equity in order to mitigate their risk. The Companys exposure to losses associated with its unconsolidated joint ventures is limited to its carrying value in these investments. (See Notes 8 and 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K.) In April 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ("SFAS No. 149"). This statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The provisions of this statement are effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 149 did not have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity ("SFAS No. 150"). This statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances). The provisions of this statement are effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise are effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. On November 7, 2003, the FASB deferred the classification and measurement provisions of SFAS No. 150 as they apply to certain mandatorily redeemable non controlling interests. This deferral is expected to remain in effect while these provisions are further evaluated by the SFAS. As a result of this deferral, the adoption of SFAS No. 150 did not have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. At December 31, 2003, the estimated fair value of minority interests relating to mandatorily redeemable non controlling interests associated with finite lived subsidiaries of the Company is approximately $3.9 million. These finite lived subsidiaries have termination dates ranging from 2019 to 2027. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As of December 31, 2003, the Company had approximately $558.2 million of floating rate debt outstanding including $45.0 million on its unsecured revolving credit facility, $85 million of unsecured MTNs due August 2004 and $329.0 million on its bridge facility due September 2004. The Company believes the interest rate risk on its floating rate debt is not material to the Company or its overall capitalization. 45 As of December 31, 2003, the Company has Canadian investments totaling CAD $189.2 million (approximately USD $145.2 million) comprised of a real estate joint venture and marketable securities. In addition, the Company has Mexican real estate investments of MXN $330.3 million (approximately USD $29.4 million). The foreign currency exchange risk has been mitigated through the use of foreign currency forward contracts (the "Forward Contracts") and a cross currency swap (the "CC Swap") with major financial institutions. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by the counter party to the Forward Contracts and the CC Swap. The Company believes it mitigates its credit risk by entering into the Forward Contracts and the CC Swap with major financial institutions. The Company has not, and does not plan to, enter into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had no other material exposure to market risk.
