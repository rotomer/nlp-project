Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in this annual report on Form 10 K. Historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the Consolidated Statements of Income contained in the Consolidated Financial Statements, including trends which might appear, should not be taken as indicative of future operations. Executive Summary Kimco Realty Corporation is one of the nations largest publicly traded owners and operators of neighborhood and community shopping centers. As of February 6, 2006, the Company had interests in 1,046 properties totaling approximately 135.5 million square feet of GLA located in 44 states, Canada and Mexico. The Company is self administered and self managed through present management, which has owned and managed neighborhood and community shopping centers for over 45 years. The executive officers are engaged in the day to day management and operation of real estate exclusively with the Company, with nearly all operating functions, including leasing, asset management, maintenance, construction, legal, finance and accounting, administered by the Company. In connection with the Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999 (the RMA), which became effective January 1, 2001, the Company is now permitted to participate in activities which it was precluded from previously in order to maintain its qualification as a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), so long as these activities are conducted in entities which elect to be treated as taxable subsidiaries under the Code, subject to certain limitations. As such, the Company, through its taxable REIT subsidiaries, is engaged in various retail real estate related opportunities including (i) merchant building, through its Kimco Developers, Inc. (KDI) subsidiary, which is primarily engaged in the ground up development of neighborhood and community shopping centers and the subsequent sale thereof upon completion, (ii) retail real estate advisory and disposition services, which primarily focuses on leasing and disposition strategies of retail real estate controlled by both healthy and distressed and or bankrupt retailers and (iii) acting as an agent or principal in connection with tax deferred exchange transactions. The Company will consider other investments through taxable REIT subsidiaries should suitable opportunities arise. In addition, the Company continues to capitalize on its established expertise in retail real estate by establishing other ventures in which the Company owns a smaller equity interest and provides management, leasing and operational support for those properties. The Company also provides preferred equity capital for real estate entrepreneurs and provides real estate capital and advisory services to both healthy and distressed retailers. The Company also makes selective investments in secondary market opportunities where a security or other investment is, in managements judgment, priced below the value of the underlying real estate. The Companys strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet while investing opportunistically and selectively. The Company intends to continue to execute its plan of delivering solid growth in earnings and dividends. As a result of the improved 2005 performance, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend per common share to $0.33 from $0.305, effective for the fourth quarter of 2005. Critical Accounting Policies The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company include the accounts of the Company, its wholly owned subsidiaries and all entities in which the Company has a controlling interest including where the Company has been determined to be a primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity in accordance with the provisions and guidance of Interpretation No. 46 (R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities or meets certain criteria of a sole general partner or managing member in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 04 5, Investors Accounting for an Investment in a Limited Partnership when the Investor is the Sole General Partner and the Limited Partners have Certain Rights (EITF 04 5). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. These estimates are based on, but not limited to, historical results, industry standards and current economic conditions, giving due 40 Back to Contents consideration to materiality. The most significant assumptions and estimates relate to revenue recognition and the recoverability of trade accounts receivable, depreciable lives and valuation of real estate. Application of these assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable Base rental revenues from rental property are recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the related leases. Certain of these leases also provide for percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the lessee. These percentage rents are recorded once the required sales level is achieved. Operating expense reimbursements are recognized as earned. Rental income may also include payments received in connection with lease termination agreements. In addition, leases typically provide for reimbursement to the Company of common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other operating expenses. The Company makes estimates of the uncollectability of its accounts receivable related to base rents, expense reimbursements and other revenues. The Company analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels, customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and estimates are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre petition and post petition claims. The Companys reported net income is directly affected by managements estimate of the collectability of accounts receivable. Real Estate The Companys investments in real estate properties are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Significant renovations and replacements, which improve and extend the life of the asset, are capitalized. Upon acquisition of operating real estate properties, the Company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, building and improvements) and identified intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above and below market leases, in place leases and tenant relationships) and assumed debt in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, Business Combinations. Based on these estimates, the Company allocates the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities. The Company utilizes methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. The useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are evaluated each reporting period with any changes in estimated useful lives being accounted for over the revised remaining useful life. Depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows: Buildings 15 to 50 years Fixtures, building and leasehold improvements (including certain identified intangible assets) Terms of leases or useful lives, whichever is shorter The Company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties. These assessments have a direct impact on the Companys net income. Real estate under development on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets represents ground up development of neighborhood and community shopping center projects which are subsequently sold upon completion. These assets are carried at cost and no depreciation is recorded. The cost of land and buildings under development includes specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved and other costs incurred during the period of development. The Company ceases cost capitalization when the property is held available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from the completion of major construction activity. If, in managements opinion, the estimated net sales price of these assets is less than the net carrying value, an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. A gain on the sale of these assets is generally recognized using the full accrual method in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Real Estate Sales. 41 Back to Contents Long Lived Assets On a periodic basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may be impaired. A property value is considered impaired only if managements estimate of current and projected operating cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the property over its remaining useful life is less than the net carrying value of the property. Such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income, trends, and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. To the extent impairment has occurred, the carrying value of the property would be adjusted to an amount to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. When a real estate asset is identified by management as held for sale, the Company ceases depreciation of the asset and estimates the sales price of such asset net of selling costs. If, in managements opinion, the net sales price of the asset is less than the net book value of such asset, an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. The Company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate properties, investments in joint ventures and other investments. The Companys reported net income is directly affected by managements estimate of impairments and or valuation allowances. Results of Operations Comparison 2005 to 2004 Revenues from rental property increased $14.9 million or 2.9% to $522.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared with $507.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. This net increase resulted primarily from the combined effect of (i) acquisitions during 2005 and 2004 providing incremental revenues of $33.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, and (ii) an overall increase in shopping center portfolio occupancy to 94.6% at December 31, 2005, as compared to 93.6% at December 31, 2004 and the completion of certain redevelopment projects and tenant buyouts providing incremental revenues of approximately $18.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the corresponding periods last year, offset by (iii) a decrease in revenues of approximately $37.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the corresponding period last year, resulting from the sale of certain properties and the transfer of operating properties to various unconsolidated joint venture entities during 2005 and 2004. Rental property expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased approximately $14.0 million or 6.1% to $243.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared with $229.9 million for the preceding year. These increases are primarily due to operating property acquisitions during 2005 and 2004, which were partially offset by property dispositions and operating properties transferred to various unconsolidated joint venture entities. Mortgage and other financing income increased $12.6 million to $27.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. This increase primarily relates to a $14.0 million prepayment fee received by the Company relating to the early repayment by Shopko of its outstanding loan with the Company. Management and other fee income increased approximately $5.0 million to $30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $25.4 million in the corresponding period in 2004. This increase is primarily due to incremental fees earned from growth in the co investment programs. General and administrative expenses increased approximately $12.6 million to $56.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $44.2 million in the preceding calendar year. This increase is primarily due to (i) a $1.4 million increase in professional fees, due in part to compliance with section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, (ii) a $3.0 million increase due to the expensing of the value attributable to stock options granted, and (iii) increased personnel and systems related costs associated with the growth of the Company. Interest, dividends and other investment income increased approximately $9.6 million to $28.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $18.7 million in 2004. This increase is primarily due to greater dividend income and realized gains on the sale 42 Back to Contents of certain marketable securities during 2005 as compared to the preceding year. Interest expense increased $20.5 million to $127.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared with $107.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. This increase is primarily due to an overall increase in average borrowings outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the preceding year, resulting from the funding of investment activity during 2005. Income from other real estate investments increased $27.8 million to $57.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $30.1 million for the preceding year. This increase is primarily due to increased investment in the Companys Preferred Equity program, which contributed income of $32.8 million during 2005, including an aggregate of approximately $12.6 million of promoted interests earned from six capital transactions during 2005, as compared to $11.4 million in 2004. Equity in income of real estate joint ventures, net increased $21.1 million to $77.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared with $56.4 million for the corresponding period in 2004. This increase is primarily attributable to (i) the increased equity in income from the Kimco Income REIT joint venture investment (KIR) resulting from the sale of two operating properties during 2005 which provided an aggregate gain of $20.2 million, of which the pro rata share to the Company was $8.7 million, (ii) increased equity in income in three joint venture investments resulting from the sale of two operating properties and one development property during 2005, which provided aggregate gains of approximately $17.9 million, of which the pro rata share to the Company was approximately $8.8 million, and (iii) the Companys growth of its various other real estate joint ventures. The Company has made additional capital investments in these and other joint ventures for the acquisition of additional shopping center properties throughout 2005 and 2004. During 2005, KDI, the Companys wholly owned development taxable REIT subsidiary, in separate transactions, sold six recently completed projects and 41 out parcels for approximately $264.1 million. These sales provided gains of approximately $22.8 million, net of income taxes of approximately $10.8 million. During 2004, KDI, the Companys wholly owned development taxable REIT subsidiary, in separate transactions, sold five recently completed projects, three completed phases of projects and 28 out parcels for approximately $169.4 million. These sales provided gains of approximately $12.4 million, net of income taxes of approximately $4.4 million. During 2005, the Company (i) disposed of, in separate transactions, 20 operating properties for an aggregate sales price of approximately $93.3 million, (ii) transferred three operating properties to KROP for an aggregate price of approximately $49.0 million, (iii) transferred 52 operating properties to various joint ventures in which the Company has non controlling interests ranging from 15% to 50% for an aggregate price of approximately $183.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2005, these transactions resulted in gains of approximately $31.9 million and a loss on sale/transfer from four of the properties for $5.2 million. During 2004, the Company (i) disposed of, in separate transactions, 16 operating properties and one ground lease for an aggregate sales price of approximately $81.1 million, including the assignment of approximately $8.0 million of non recourse mortgage debt encumbering one of the properties; cash proceeds of approximately $16.9 million from the sale of two of these properties were used in a 1031 exchange to acquire shopping center properties located in Roanoke, VA, and Tempe, AZ, (ii) transferred 17 operating properties to KROP for an aggregate price of approximately $197.9 million and (iii) transferred 21 operating properties to various co investment ventures in which the Company has non controlling interests ranging from 10% to 30% for an aggregate price of approximately $491.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2004, these dispositions resulted in gains of approximately $15.8 million and a loss on sale from three of the properties of approximately $5.1 million. As part of the Companys periodic assessment of its real estate properties with regard to both the extent to which such assets are consistent with the Companys long term real estate investment objectives and the performance and prospects of each asset, the Company determined in 2004 that its investment in an operating property comprised of approximately 0.1 million square feet of GLA, with a net book value of $3.8 million, might not be fully recoverable. Based upon managements assessment of current market conditions and lack of demand for the property, the Company reduced its anticipated holding period of this investment. As a result of the reduction in the anticipated holding period, together with reassessment of the potential future operating cash flow for the property and the effects of current market conditions, the Company determined that its investment in this asset was 43 Back to Contents not fully recoverable and recorded an adjustment of property carrying value of approximately $3.0 million in 2004. This adjustment was included, along with the related property operations in the line Income from discontinued operating properties, in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income. For those property dispositions for which SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS No. 144) is applicable, the operations and gain or loss on the sale of the property have been included in the caption Discontinued operations in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2005, was $363.6 million, compared to $297.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. On a diluted per share basis, net income increased $0.26 to $1.52 for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $1.26 for the previous year. This increase is attributable to (i) increased income from other real estate investments, primarily from the Companys Preferred Equity program, (ii) an increase in equity in income of real estate joint ventures achieved from gains on sales of joint venture operating properties and additional capital investments in the Companys joint venture programs for the acquisition of additional shopping center properties throughout 2005 and 2004, (iii) increased income contributed from mortgage and other financing receivables as compared to last year and (iv) increased gains on sale/transfer of development and operating properties during 2005, as compared to the same period during 2004. Comparison 2004 to 2003 Revenues from rental property increased $41.4 million or 8.9% to $507.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared with $466.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This net increase resulted primarily from the combined effect of (i) acquisitions during 2004 and 2003 providing incremental revenues of $40.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, and (ii) an overall increase in shopping center portfolio occupancy to 93.6% at December 31, 2004, as compared to 90.7% at December 31, 2003 and the completion of certain redevelopment projects and tenant buyouts providing incremental revenues of approximately $16.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the corresponding periods last year, offset by (iii) a decrease in revenues of approximately $15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the corresponding period last year, resulting from the sale of certain properties and the transfer of operating properties to various unconsolidated joint venture entities during 2004 and 2003. Rental property expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased approximately $26.3 million or 12.9% to $229.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared with $203.5 million for the preceding year. This increase was primarily due to operating property acquisitions during 2004 and 2003, which were partially offset by property dispositions and operating properties transferred to various unconsolidated joint venture entities. Mortgage and other financing income decreased $3.8 million to $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest and financing income earned related to certain real estate lending activities during 2004 as compared to the preceding year. Management and other fee income increased approximately $10.1 million to $25.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to $15.3 million in the corresponding period in 2003. This increase was primarily due to incremental fees earned from growth in the co investment programs and fees earned from disposition services provided to various retailers. General and administrative expenses increased approximately $5.9 million to $44.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to $38.3 million in the preceding calendar year. This increase was primarily due to (i) a $0.9 million increase in professional fees, mainly attributable to compliance with section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, (ii) a $1.6 million increase due to the expensing of the value attributable to stock options granted, (iii) increased staff levels related to the growth of the Company and (iv) other personnel related costs, associated with a realignment of our regional operations. Other income/(expense), net increased approximately $14.2 million to $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the preceding year. This increase was primarily due to a prior year write down in the carrying value of the Companys equity investment in Franks Nursery, Inc., offset by increased income in 2004 from other equity investments. 44 Back to Contents Interest expense increased $4.8 million to $107.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared with $102.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily due to an overall increase in average borrowings outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the preceding year, resulting from the funding of investment activity during 2004. During 2003, the Company reached agreement with certain lenders in connection with three individual non recourse mortgages encumbering three former Kmart sites. The Company paid approximately $14.2 million in full satisfaction of these loans, which aggregated approximately $24.0 million. As a result of these transactions, the Company recognized a gain on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $9.7 million during 2003. Income from other real estate investments increased $7.3 million to $30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to $22.8 million for the preceding year. This increase was primarily due to increased investment in the Companys Preferred Equity program, which contributed income of $11.4 million during 2004, as compared to $4.6 million in 2003. Equity in income of real estate joint ventures, net increased $14.1 million to $56.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared with $42.3 million for the preceding year. This increase was primarily attributable to the equity in income from the increased investment in the RioCan joint venture investment (RioCan Venture), the Kimco Retail Opportunity Portfolio joint venture investment (KROP) and the Companys growth of its various other real estate joint ventures. The Company had made additional capital investments in these and other joint ventures for the acquisition of additional shopping center properties throughout 2004 and 2003. During 2004, KDI, the Companys wholly owned development taxable REIT subsidiary, in separate transactions, sold 28 out parcels, three completed phases of projects and five recently completed projects for approximately $169.4 million. These sales provided gains of approximately $12.4 million, net of income taxes of approximately $4.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2003, KDI sold four projects and 26 out parcels, in separate transactions, for approximately $134.6 million which resulted in gains of approximately $10.5 million, net of income taxes of $7.0 million. During 2004, the Company (i) disposed of, in separate transactions, 16 operating properties and one ground lease for an aggregate sales price of approximately $81.1 million, including the assignment of approximately $8.0 million of non recourse mortgage debt encumbering one of the properties; cash proceeds of approximately $16.9 million from the sale of two of these properties were used in a 1031 exchange to acquire shopping center properties located in Roanoke, VA, and Tempe, AZ, (ii) transferred 17 operating properties to KROP for an aggregate price of approximately $197.9 million and (iii) transferred 21 operating properties to various co investment ventures in which the Company has non controlling interests ranging from 10% to 30% for an aggregate price of approximately $491.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2004, these dispositions resulted in gains of approximately $15.8 million and a loss on sale from three of the properties of approximately $5.1 million. As part of the Companys periodic assessment of its real estate properties with regard to both the extent to which such assets are consistent with the Companys long term real estate investment objectives and the performance and prospects of each asset, the Company determined in 2004 that its investment in an operating property comprised of approximately 0.1 million square feet of GLA, with a net book value of $3.8 million, might not be fully recoverable. Based upon managements assessment of current market conditions and lack of demand for the property, the Company reduced its anticipated holding period of this investment. As a result of the reduction in the anticipated holding period, together with reassessment of the potential future operating cash flow for the property and the effects of current market conditions, the Company determined that its investment in this asset was not fully recoverable and recorded an adjustment of property carrying value of approximately $3.0 million in 2004. This adjustment was included, along with the related property operations in the line Income from discontinued operating properties, in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income. During 2003, the Company disposed of, in separate transactions, (i) ten operating shopping center properties for an aggregate sales price of approximately $119.1 million, including the assignment of approximately $1.7 million of mortgage debt encumbering one of the properties, (ii) two regional malls for an aggregate sales price of approximately $135.6 45 Back to Contents million, (iii) one out parcel for a sales price of approximately $8.1 million, (iv) transferred three operating properties to KROP for a price of approximately $144.2 million, (v) transferred an operating property to a newly formed joint venture in which the Company has a non controlling 10% interest for a price of approximately $21.9 million and (vi) terminated four leasehold positions in locations where a tenant in bankruptcy had rejected its lease. These transactions resulted in gains of approximately $50.8 million. During 2003, the Company identified two operating properties, comprised of approximately 0.2 million square feet of GLA, as Held for Sale in accordance with SFAS No. 144. The book value of these properties, aggregating approximately $19.5 million, net of accumulated depreciation of approximately $2.0 million, exceeded their estimated fair value. The Companys determination of the fair value of these properties, aggregating approximately $15.4 million, was based upon contracts of sale with third parties less estimated selling costs. As a result, the Company recorded an adjustment of property carrying values of $4.0 million. This adjustment was included, along with the related property operations for the current and comparative years, in the caption Income from discontinued operations in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income. For those property dispositions for which SFAS No. 144 was applicable, the operations and gain or loss on the sale of the property have been included in the caption Discontinued operations in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income. Income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2004, was $281.0, compared to $243.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. On a diluted per share basis, income from continuing operations improved $0.17 to $1.19 for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to $1.02 for the preceding year. This improved performance was primarily attributable to (i) the incremental operating results from the acquisition of operating properties during 2004 and 2003, including the Mid Atlantic Realty Trust transaction, (ii) an increase in equity in income of real estate joint ventures resulting from additional capital investments in the RioCan Venture, KROP and other joint venture investments for the acquisition of additional shopping center properties during 2004 and 2003, (iii) an increase in management and other fee income related to the growth in the co investment programs, (iv) increased income from other real estate investments and (v) significant leasing within the portfolio, which improved operating profitability. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2004, was $297.1 million, compared to $307.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. On a diluted per share basis, net income decreased $0.05 to $1.26 for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to $1.31 for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower income from discontinued operations of $48.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to the preceding year due to property sales during 2004 and 2003 and gains on early extinguishment of debt during 2003. In addition, the diluted per share results for the year ended December 31, 2003, were decreased by a reduction in net income available to common stockholders of $0.04 resulting from the deduction of original issuance costs associated with the redemption of the Companys 7% Class A, 8 1/2% Class B and 8 3/8% Class C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stocks during the second quarter of 2003. Tenant Concentrations The Company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing risks through diversification achieved by the geographic distribution of its properties, avoiding dependence on any single property, and a large tenant base. At December 31, 2005, the Companys five largest tenants were The Home Depot, TJX Companies, Sears Holdings, Kohls and Royal Ahold, which represented approximately 3.6%, 3.2%, 2.7%, 2.5% and 2.0%, respectively, of the Companys annualized base rental revenues, including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the Company has less than a 100% economic interest. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys cash flow activities are summarized as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Net cash flow provided by operating activities $ 410.8 $ 365.2 $ 308.6 Net cash flow used for investing activities $ (716.0 ) $ (299.6 ) $ (637.6 ) Net cash flow provided by (used for) financing activities $ 343.3 $ (75.6 ) $ 341.3 46 Back to Contents Operating Activities The Company anticipates that cash flows from operations will continue to provide adequate capital to fund its operating and administrative expenses, regular debt service obligations and all dividend payments in accordance with REIT requirements in both the short term and long term. In addition, the Company anticipates that cash on hand, borrowings under its revolving credit facilities, issuance of equity and public debt, as well as other debt and equity alternatives, will provide the necessary capital required by the Company. Net cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2005, was primarily attributable to (i) cash flow from the diverse portfolio of rental properties, (ii) the acquisition of operating properties during 2004 and 2005, (iii) new leasing, expansion and re tenanting of core portfolio properties and (iv) growth in the Companys joint venture and Preferred Equity programs. Investing Activities Acquisitions and Redevelopments During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company expended approximately $376.0 million towards acquisition of and improvements to operating real estate. (See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K.) The Company has an ongoing program to reformat and re tenant its properties to maintain or enhance its competitive position in the marketplace. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company expended approximately $55.5 million in connection with these major redevelopments and re tenanting projects. The Company anticipates its capital commitment toward these and other redevelopment projects during 2006 will be approximately $90.0 million to $110.0 million. The funding of these capital requirements will be provided by cash flow from operating activities and availability under the Companys revolving lines of credit. Investments and Advances to Real Estate Joint Ventures During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company expended approximately $267.3 million for investments and advances to real estate joint ventures and received approximately $130.6 million from reimbursements of advances to real estate joint ventures. (See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K.) Ground up Development The Company is engaged in ground up development projects which consists of (i) merchant building through the Companys wholly owned taxable REIT subsidiary, KDI, which develops neighborhood and community shopping centers and the subsequent sale thereof upon completion, (ii) ground up development projects which will be held as long term investments by the Company and (iii) various ground up development projects located in Mexico and Canada for long term investment. All ground up development projects generally have substantial pre leasing prior to the commencement of construction. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had in progress a total of 38 ground up development projects including 26 merchant building projects, five domestic ground up development projects, six ground up development projects located throughout Mexico and one ground up development project located in Canada. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company expended approximately $452.7 million in connection with the purchase of land and construction costs related to these projects and those sold during 2005. These projects are currently proceeding on schedule and substantially in line with the Companys budgeted costs. The Company anticipates its capital commitment during 2006 toward these and other development projects will be approximately $300 million to $350 million. The proceeds from the sales of the completed ground up development projects, proceeds from construction loans and availability under the Companys revolving lines of credit are expected to be sufficient to fund these anticipated capital requirements. (See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K.) Dispositions and Transfers During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $348.4 million relating to the sale of various operating properties and ground up development projects and approximately $128.5 million from the transfer of operating properties to various joint ventures. (See Notes 3 and 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K.) 47 Back to Contents Financing Activities It is managements intention that the Company continually have access to the capital resources necessary to expand and develop its business. As such, the Company intends to operate with and maintain a conservative capital structure with a level of debt to total market capitalization of 50% or less. As of December 31, 2005, the Companys level of debt to total market capitalization was 26%. In addition, the Company intends to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixed charge coverage ratios as part of its commitment to maintaining its investment grade debt ratings. The Company may, from time to time, seek to obtain funds through additional equity offerings, unsecured debt financings and or mortgage/construction loan financings and other capital alternatives in a manner consistent with its intention to operate with a conservative debt structure. Since the completion of the Companys IPO in 1991, the Company has utilized the public debt and equity markets as its principal source of capital for its expansion needs. Since the IPO, the Company has completed additional offerings of its public unsecured debt and equity, raising in the aggregate over $4.2 billion for the purposes of, among other things, repaying indebtedness, acquiring interests in neighborhood and community shopping centers, funding ground up development projects, expanding and improving properties in the portfolio and other investments. The Company has an $850.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which is scheduled to expire in July 2008. This credit facility has made available funds to both finance the purchase of properties and other investments and meet any short term working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2005, there was $200.0 million outstanding under this credit facility. During September 2004, the Company entered into a three year Canadian denominated (CAD) $150.0 million unsecured credit facility with a group of banks. This facility bears interest at the CDOR Rate, as defined, plus 0.50%, and is scheduled to expire in September 2007. During March 2005, this facility was increased to CAD $250.0 million and the scheduled maturity date was extended to March 2008. During January 2006, the facility was further amended to reduce the borrowing spread to 0.45% and to modify the covenant package to conform to the Companys $850.0 million U.S. Credit Facility. Proceeds from this facility will be used for general corporate purposes including the funding of Canadian denominated investments. As of December 31, 2005, there was CAD $110.0 million (approximately USD $94.7 million) outstanding under this credit facility. During May 2005, the Company entered into a three year Mexican Peso denominated (MXP) 500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility. This facility bears interest at the TIIE Rate, as defined, plus 1.00% and is scheduled to expire in May 2008. Proceeds from this facility will be used to fund peso denominated investments. As of December 31, 2005, there was MXP 500.0 million (approximately USD $46.7 million) outstanding under this facility. The Company has a MTN program pursuant to which it may, from time to time, offer for sale its senior unsecured debt for any general corporate purposes, including (i) funding specific liquidity requirements in its business, including property acquisitions, development and redevelopment costs and (ii) managing the Companys debt maturities. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had $250.0 million available for issuance under the MTN program. (See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K.) In addition to the public equity and debt markets as capital sources, the Company may, from time to time, obtain mortgage financing on selected properties and construction loans to partially fund the capital needs of KDI. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had over 380 unencumbered property interests in its portfolio. During July 2005, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S 3 for up to $1.0 billion of debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock and common stock warrants. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had $750.0 million available for issuance under this shelf registration statement. In connection with its intention to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Company expects to continue paying regular dividends to its stockholders. These dividends will be paid from operating cash flows, which are expected to increase due to property acquisitions, growth in operating income in the existing portfolio and from other investments. Since cash used to pay dividends reduces amounts available for capital investment, the Company generally intends to maintain a conservative dividend payout ratio, reserving such amounts as it considers necessary for the expansion and renovation 48 Back to Contents of shopping centers in its portfolio, debt reduction, the acquisition of interests in new properties and other investments as suitable opportunities arise and such other factors as the Board of Directors considers appropriate. Cash dividends paid increased to $293.3 million in 2005, compared to $265.3 million in 2004 and $246.3 million in 2003. Although the Company receives substantially all of its rental payments on a monthly basis, it generally intends to continue paying dividends quarterly. Amounts accumulated in advance of each quarterly distribution will be invested by the Company in short term money market or other suitable instruments. Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments The Company has debt obligations relating to its revolving credit facilities, MTNs, senior notes, mortgages and construction loans with maturities ranging from less than one year to 29 years. As of December 31, 2005, the Companys total debt had a weighted average term to maturity of approximately 4.9 years. In addition, the Company has non cancelable operating leases pertaining to its shopping center portfolio. As of December 31, 2005, the Company has 60 shopping center properties that are subject to long term ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to the Company to construct and or operate a shopping center. In addition, the Company has 22 non cancelable operating leases pertaining to its retail store lease portfolio. The following table summarizes the Companys debt maturities and obligations under non cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2005 (in millions): 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total Long Term Debt $ 286.8 $ 290.3 $ 555.3 $ 201.9 $ 198.8 $ 1,158.1 $ 2,691.2 Operating Leases Ground Leases $ 11.3 $ 10.6 $ 10.5 $ 10.0 $ 8.3 $ 140.8 $ 191.5 Retail Store Leases $ 5.2 $ 4.4 $ 3.3 $ 2.4 $ 2.0 $ 2.0 $ 19.3 The Company has $185.0 million of medium term notes, $14.1 million of mortgage debt and $87.7 million of construction loans maturing in 2006. The Company anticipates satisfying these maturities with a combination of operating cash flows, its unsecured revolving credit facilities, new debt issuances and the sale of completed ground up development projects. The Company has issued letters of credit in connection with completion and repayment guarantees for construction loans encumbering certain of the Companys ground up development projects, and guaranty of payment related to the Companys insurance program. These letters of credit aggregate approximately $34.8 million. Additionally, the RioCan Venture, an entity in which the Company holds a 50% non controlling interest, has a CAD $7.0 million (approximately USD $6.0 million) letter of credit facility. This facility is jointly guaranteed by RioCan and the Company and had approximately CAD $4.6 million (approximately USD $4.0 million) outstanding as of December 31, 2005, relating to various development projects. In addition to the letter of credit facility, various additional Canadian development projects in which the Company holds interests ranging from 33 1/3% to 50% have letters of credit issued aggregating approximately CAD $3.5 million (approximately USD $3.0 million) at December 31, 2005. During 2005, a joint venture entity in which the Company has a non controlling interest obtained a CAD $22.5 million credit facility to finance the construction of a 0.1 million square foot shopping center property located in Kamloops, B.C. This facility bears interest at Royal Bank Prime Rate (RBP) plus 0.5% per annum and is scheduled to mature in May 2007. The Company and its partner in this entity each have a limited and several guarantee of CAD $7.5 million on this facility. As of December 31, 2005, there was no outstanding balance on this facility. During 2005, the Company obtained a term loan and construction financing on two ground up development projects for an aggregate net loan commitment amount of up to $50.5 million of which approximately $22.4 million was outstanding at December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had 15 construction loans with total commitments of up to $343.5 million of which $228.5 million had been funded to the Company. These loans had maturities ranging from 4 months to 31 months and interest rates ranging from 6.04% to 6.64% at December 31, 2005. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Ground Up Development Joint Ventures 49 Back to Contents At December 31, 2005, the Company has three ground up development projects through unconsolidated joint ventures in which the Company has 50% non controlling interests. The projects are financed with individual non recourse construction loans with total aggregate loan commitments of up to $219.6 million of which $58.8 million has been funded. These loans have variable interest rates ranging from 4.89% to 8.25% at December 31, 2005 and maturities ranging from 4 months to 18 months. Unconsolidated Real Estate Joint Ventures The Company has investments in various unconsolidated real estate joint ventures with varying structures. These investments include the Companys 43.3% non controlling interest in KIR, the Companys 50% non controlling interest in the RioCan Venture, the Companys 20% non controlling interest in KROP, the Companys 15% non controlling interest in Price Legacy and varying non controlling interests in other real estate joint ventures. These joint ventures operate either shopping center properties or are established for development projects. Such arrangements are generally with third party institutional investors, local developers and individuals. The properties owned by the joint ventures are primarily financed with individual non recourse mortgage loans. Non recourse mortgage debt is generally defined as debt whereby the lenders sole recourse with respect to borrower defaults is limited to the value of the property collateralized by the mortgage. The lender generally does not have recourse against any other assets owned by the borrower or any of the constituent members of the borrower, except for certain specified exceptions listed in the particular loan documents. The KIR joint venture was established for the purpose of investing in high quality real estate properties financed primarily with individual non recourse mortgages. The Company believes that these properties are appropriate for financing with greater leverage than the Company traditionally uses. As of December 31, 2005, KIR had interests in 68 properties comprising 14.2 million square feet of GLA. As of December 31, 2005, KIR had individual non recourse mortgage loans of approximately $1.1 billion on 65 of these properties. These non recourse mortgage loans have maturities ranging from less than one year to 14 years and rates ranging from 4.99% to 8.52%. As of December 31, 2005, the Companys pro rata share of non recourse mortgages relating to the KIR joint venture was approximately $485.4 million. (See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K.) The RioCan Venture was established with RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust to acquire properties and development projects in Canada. As of December 31, 2005, the RioCan Venture consisted of 34 shopping center properties and one development project with approximately 8.1 million square feet of GLA. As of December 31, 2005, the RioCan Venture had individual, non recourse mortgage loans on 33 of these properties and a construction loan on its development property aggregating approximately CAD $706.3 million (USD $607.8 million). These loans have maturities ranging from less than one year to 28 years and rates ranging from 3.91% to 9.05%. As of December 31, 2005, the Companys pro rata share of these non recourse loans relating to the RioCan Venture was approximately CAD $349.2 million (USD $300.5 million). (See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K.) The Kimco Retail Opportunity Portfolio (KROP), a joint venture with GE Capital Real Estate (GECRE), was established to acquire high growth potential retail properties in the United States. As of December 31, 2005, KROP consisted of 38 shopping center properties with approximately 5.6 million square feet of GLA. As of December 31, 2005, KROP had non recourse mortgage loans totaling $481.9 million, with fixed rates ranging from 4.25% to 8.64% and variable rates ranging from LIBOR plus 1.3% to LIBOR plus 2.2%. KROP has entered into a series of interest rate cap agreements to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on its variable rate mortgage agreements. Such mortgage debt is collateralized by the individual shopping center property and is payable in monthly installments of principal and interest. At December 31, 2005, the weighted average interest rate for all mortgage debt outstanding was 6.09% per annum. As of December 31, 2005, the Companys pro rata share of non recourse mortgage loans relating to the KROP joint venture was approximately $96.4 million. Additionally, the Company and GECRE may provide interim financing. All such financings bear interest at rates ranging from LIBOR plus 4.0% to LIBOR plus 5.25% and have maturities of less than a year. As of December 31, 2005, KROP had no outstanding short term interim financing due to the Company or GECRE. (See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K.) During December 2004, the Company acquired the Price Legacy Corporation through a newly formed joint venture, PL Retail LLC (PL Retail), in which the Company has a non controlling 15% interest. In connection with this transaction, the joint venture acquired 33 operating properties aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet of GLA located 50 Back to Contents in ten states. During the year ended December 31, 2005, PL Retail disposed of nine operating properties, in separate transactions, for an aggregate sale price of approximately $21.8 million. As of December 31, 2005, PL Retail consisted of 25 operating properties aggregating approximately 6.8 million square feet of GLA. As of December 31, 2005, PL Retail had approximately $777.3 million outstanding in non recourse mortgage debt, of which approximately $507.2 million had fixed rates ranging from 4.66% to 9.00% and approximately $270.1 had variable rates ranging from 5.74% to 9.59%. The fixed rate loans have maturities ranging from three to 11 years and the variable rate loans have maturities ranging from one to three years. Additionally, the Company had provided PL Retail approximately $30.6 million of secured mezzanine financing. This interest only loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 7.5% and matures in December 2006. Proceeds from property sales during 2005 of approximately $21.8 million were used to partially repay the mezzanine financing that was provided by the Company. The Company also provided PL Retail a secured short term promissory note of approximately $8.2 million. This interest only note bore interest at LIBOR plus 4.5% and was scheduled to mature in June 2005. During 2005, this note was amended to bear interest at LIBOR plus 6% and is now payable on demand. As of December 31, 2005, PL Retail had approximately $8.9 million outstanding on the mezzanine financing and approximately $8.2 million outstanding on the promissory note. As of December 31, 2005, the Companys pro rata share of non recourse mortgages relating to PL Retail was approximately $116.6 million. (See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K.) The Company has various other unconsolidated real estate joint ventures with varying structures. As of December 31, 2005, these unconsolidated joint ventures had individual non recourse mortgage loans aggregating approximately $1.5 billion. The Companys pro rata share of these non recourse mortgages was approximately $520.6 million. (See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K.) Other Real Estate Investments During November 2002, the Company, through its taxable REIT subsidiary, together with Prometheus Southeast Retail Trust, completed the merger and privatization of Konover Property Trust, which has been renamed Kimsouth Realty, Inc., (Kimsouth). The Company acquired 44.5% of the common stock of Kimsouth, which consisted primarily of 38 retail shopping center properties comprising approximately 4.6 million square feet of GLA. Total acquisition value was approximately $280.9 million including approximately $216.2 million in mortgage debt. The Companys investment strategy with respect to Kimsouth includes re tenanting, repositioning and disposition of the properties. As a result of this strategy, Kimsouth has sold 33 properties as of December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, the Kimsouth portfolio was comprised of five properties, including the remaining office component of an operating property sold in 2004, totaling 1.2 million square feet of GLA with non recourse mortgage debt of approximately $29.4 million encumbering the properties. All mortgages payable are collateralized by certain properties and are due in monthly installments. As of December 31, 2005, interest rates ranged from 6.06% to 9.22% and the weighted average interest rate for all mortgage debt outstanding was 8.35% per annum. As of December 31, 2005, the Companys pro rata share of non recourse mortgage loans relating to the Kimsouth portfolio was approximately $13.1 million. During June 2002, the Company acquired a 90% equity participation interest in an existing leveraged lease of 30 properties. The properties are leased under a long term bond type net lease whose primary term expires in 2016, with the lessee having certain renewal option rights. The Companys cash equity investment was approximately $4.0 million. This equity investment is reported as a net investment in leveraged lease in accordance with SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases (as amended). The net investment in leveraged lease reflects the original cash investment adjusted by remaining net rentals, estimated unguaranteed residual value, unearned and deferred income, and deferred taxes relating to the investment. As of December 31, 2005, 14 of these properties were sold, whereby the proceeds from the sales were used to pay down the mortgage debt by approximately $24.2 million. As of December 31, 2005, the remaining 16 properties were encumbered by third party non recourse debt of approximately $58.7 million that is scheduled to fully amortize during the primary term of the lease from a portion of the periodic net rents receivable under the net lease. As an equity participant in the leveraged lease, the Company has no recourse obligation for principal or interest payments on the debt, which is collateralized by a first mortgage lien on the properties and collateral assignment of the lease. Accordingly, this debt has been offset against the related net rental receivable under the lease. The Company maintains a preferred equity program, which provides capital to developers and owners of shopping centers. The Company accounts for its investments in preferred equity 51 Back to Contents investments under the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 2005, the Companys invested capital in its preferred equity investments approximated $225.9 million relating to 133 real estate properties. As of December 31, 2005, these preferred equity investment properties had individual non recourse mortgage loans aggregating approximately $703.3 million. Due to the Companys preferred position in these investments, the Companys pro rata share of each investment is subject to fluctuation and is dependent upon property cash flows. The Companys maximum exposure to losses associated with its preferred equity investments is limited to its invested capital. Effects of Inflation Many of the Companys leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. Such provisions include clauses enabling the Company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants gross sales above pre determined thresholds, which generally increase as prices rise, and or escalation clauses, which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases. Such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices. In addition, many of the Companys leases are for terms of less than 10 years, which permits the Company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal. Most of the Companys leases require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance, thereby reducing the Companys exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. The Company periodically evaluates its exposure to short term interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and will, from time to time, enter into interest rate protection agreements and or foreign currency hedge agreements which mitigate, but do not eliminate, the effect of changes in interest rates on its floating rate debt and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123, (revised 2004) Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123(R)), which supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related implementation guidance. SFAS No. 123(R) established standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entitys equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. This Statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions. SFAS No. 123(R) is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The impact of adopting this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 153, Exchange of Non monetary Assets an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29 (SFAS No. 153). The guidance in APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Non monetary Transactions, is based on the principle that exchanges of non monetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. The guidance in that Opinion, however, included certain exceptions to that principle. This Statement amends Opinion No. 29 to eliminate the exception for non monetary assets that do not have commercial substance. A non monetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. SFAS No. 153 is effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The impact of adopting this statement did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (FIN 47). FIN 47 requires an entity to recognize a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability can be reasonably estimated. FIN 47 clarifies that the term Conditional Asset Retirement Obligation refers to a legal obligation (pursuant to existing laws or by contract) to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. FIN 47 was effective no later than fiscal years ended after December 15, 2005. The Company adopted FIN 47 as required effective December 31, 2005, and the initial application of FIN 47 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections (SFAS No. 154), which replaces Accounting Principle Board Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements. 52 Back to Contents SFAS No. 154 changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principles. It requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. This statement is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. In September 2005, the EITF issued Issue 04 5, Investors Accounting for an Investment in a Limited Partnership When the Investor is the Sole General Partner and the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, (EITF 04 5). At issue is what rights held by the limited partner(s) preclude consolidation in circumstances in which the sole general partner would consolidate the limited partnership in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The assessment of limited partners rights and their impact on the presumption of control of the limited partnership by the sole general partner should be made when an investor becomes the sole general partner and should be reassessed if (i) there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of the limited partners, (ii) the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership of limited partnership interests, or (iii) there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership interests. This issue is effective no later than for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005, and as of June 29, 2005, for new or modified arrangements. The impact of adopting EITF 04 5 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Companys primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. The following table presents the Companys aggregate fixed rate and variable rate domestic and foreign debt obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2005, with corresponding weighted average interest rates sorted by maturity date. The information is presented in U.S. dollar equivalents, which is the Companys reporting currency. The instruments actual cash flows are denominated in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars and Mexican pesos, as indicated by geographic region ($ in USD equivalent in millions). 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011+ Total Fair Value Domestic Secured Debt Fixed Rate $ 9.7 $ $ 59.4 $ 21.9 $ 19.7 $ 191.1 $ 301.8 $ 317.4 Average Interest Rate 9.08 % 7.13 % 7.88 % 8.47 % 7.41 % 7.52 % Variable Rate $ 92.1 $ 95.3 $ 54.5 $ $ $ $ 241.9 $ 241.9 Average Interest Rate 6.40 % 6.20 % 6.11 % 6.26 % Unsecured Debt Fixed Rate $ 85.0 $ 195.0 $ 100.0 $ 180.0 $ 50.0 $ 967.0 $ 1,577.0 $ 1,640.0 Average Interest Rate 7.30 % 7.14 % 3.95 % 6.98 % 4.62 % 5.30 % 5.72 % Variable Rate $ 100.0 $ $ 200.0 $ $ $ $ 300.0 $ 300.0 Average Interest Rate 4.45 % 4.68 % 4.60 % 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011+ Total Fair Value Canadian Unsecured Debt Fixed Rate $ $ $ $ $ 129.1 $ $ 129.1 $ 126.7 Average Interest Rate 4.45 % 4.45 % Variable Rate $ $ $ 94.7 $ $ $ $ 94.7 $ 94.7 Average Interest Rate 3.78 % 3.78 % Mexican Unsecured Debt Variable Rate $ $ $ 46.7 $ $ $ $ 46.7 $ 46.7 Average Interest Rate 9.66 % 9.66 % 53 Back to Contents Based on the Companys variable rate debt balances, interest expense would have increased by approximately $6.8 million in 2005 if short term interest rates were 1% higher. As of December 31, 2005, the Company has Canadian investments totaling CAD $311.8 million (approximately USD $268.3 million) comprised of a real estate joint venture investments and marketable securities. In addition, the Company has Mexican real estate investments of MXN 2.3 billion (approximately USD $215.4 million). The foreign currency exchange risk has been partially mitigated through the use of local currency denominated debt, foreign currency forward contracts (the Forward Contracts) and a cross currency swap (the CC Swap) with major financial institutions. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by the counter party to the Forward Contracts and the CC Swap. The Company believes it mitigates its credit risk by entering into the Forward Contracts and the CC Swap with major financial institutions. The Company has not entered, and does not plan to enter, into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had no other material exposure to market risk.
