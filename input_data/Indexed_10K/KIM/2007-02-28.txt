Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in this annual report on Form 10 K. Historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the Consolidated Statements of Income contained in the Consolidated Financial Statements, including trends which might appear, should not be taken as indicative of future operations. Executive Summary Kimco Realty Corporation is one of the nations largest publicly traded owners and operators of neighborhood and community shopping centers. As of January 31, 2007, the Company had interests in 1,348 properties totaling approximately 175.4 million square feet of GLA located in 45 states, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico. The Company is self administered and self managed through present management, which has owned and managed neighborhood and community shopping centers for over 45 years. The executive officers are engaged in the day to day management and operation of real estate exclusively with the Company, with nearly all operating functions, including leasing, asset management, maintenance, construction, legal, finance and accounting, administered by the Company. In connection with the Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999 (the RMA), which became effective January 1, 2001, the Company is permitted to participate in activities which it was precluded from previously in order to maintain its qualification as a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), so long as these activities are conducted in entities which elect to be treated as taxable subsidiaries under the Code, subject to certain limitations. As such, the Company, through its taxable REIT subsidiaries, is engaged in various retail real estate related opportunities including (i) merchant building, through its KDI subsidiary, which is primarily engaged in the ground up development of neighborhood and community shopping centers and the subsequent sale thereof upon completion, (ii) retail real estate advisory and disposition services, which primarily focuses on leasing and disposition strategies of retail real estate controlled by both healthy and distressed and or bankrupt retailers and (iii) acting as an agent or principal in connection with tax deferred exchange transactions. The Company will consider other investments through taxable REIT subsidiaries should suitable opportunities arise. In addition, the Company continues to capitalize on its established expertise in retail real estate by establishing other ventures in which the Company owns a smaller equity interest and provides management, leasing and operational support for those properties. The Company also provides preferred equity capital for real estate entrepreneurs and provides real estate capital and advisory services to both healthy and distressed retailers. The Company also makes selective investments in secondary market opportunities where a security or other investment is, in managements judgment, priced below the value of the underlying real estate. The Companys strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet while investing opportunistically and selectively. The Company intends to continue to execute its plan of delivering solid growth in earnings and dividends. As a result of the improved 2006 performance, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend per common share to $0.36 from $0.33, effective for the third quarter of 2006. Critical Accounting Policies The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company include the accounts of the Company, its wholly owned subsidiaries and all entities in which the Company has a controlling interest including where the Company has been determined to be a primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity in accordance with the provisions and guidance of Interpretation No. 46 (R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities or meets certain criteria of a sole general partner or managing member in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 04 5, Investors Accounting for an Investment in a Limited Partnership when the Investor is the Sole General Partner and the Limited Partners have Certain Rights (EITF 04 5). The Company applies these provisions to each of its joint venture investments to determine whether the cost, equity or consolidation method of accounting is appropriate. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and assumptions that affect the 46 Table of Contents reported amounts of assets and liabilities. These estimates are based on, but not limited to, historical results, industry standards and current economic conditions, giving due consideration to materiality. The most significant assumptions and estimates relate to revenue recognition and the recoverability of trade accounts receivable, depreciable lives, valuation of real estate and realizability of deferred tax assets. Application of these assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable Base rental revenues from rental property are recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the related leases. Certain of these leases also provide for percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the lessee. These percentage rents are recorded once the required sales level is achieved. Operating expense reimbursements are recognized as earned. Rental income may also include payments received in connection with lease termination agreements. In addition, leases typically provide for reimbursement to the Company of common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other operating expenses. The Company makes estimates of the uncollectability of its accounts receivable related to base rents, expense reimbursements and other revenues. The Company analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels, customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and estimates are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre petition and post petition claims. The Companys reported net income is directly affected by managements estimate of the collectability of accounts receivable. Real Estate The Companys investments in real estate properties are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Significant renovations and replacements, which improve and extend the life of the asset, are capitalized. Upon acquisition of operating real estate properties, the Company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, building and improvements) and identified intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above and below market leases, in place leases and tenant relationships) and assumed debt in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, Business Combinations. Based on these estimates, the Company allocates the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities. The Company utilizes methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. The useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are evaluated each reporting period with any changes in estimated useful lives being accounted for over the revised remaining useful life. Depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows: Buildings 15 to 50 years Fixtures, building and leasehold improvements (including certain identified intangible assets) Terms of leases or useful lives, whichever is shorter The Company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties. These assessments have a direct impact on the Companys net income. Real estate under development on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets represents ground up development of neighborhood and community shopping center projects which are subsequently sold upon completion and projects which the Company may hold as long term investments. These assets are carried at cost. The cost of land and buildings under development includes specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved and other costs incurred during the period of development. The Company ceases cost capitalization when the property is held available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from the completion of major construction activity. If, in managements opinion, the estimated net sales price of these assets is less than the net carrying value, an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. A gain on the sale of these assets is generally recognized using the full accrual method in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Real Estate Sales. 47 Table of Contents Long Lived Assets On a periodic basis, management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may be impaired. A property value is considered impaired only if managements estimate of current and projected operating cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the property over its remaining useful life is less than the net carrying value of the property. Such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income, trends, and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. To the extent impairment has occurred, the carrying value of the property would be adjusted to an amount to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. When a real estate asset is identified by management as held for sale, the Company ceases depreciation of the asset and estimates the sales price of such asset net of selling costs. If, in managements opinion, the net sales price of the asset is less than the net book value of such asset, an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property. The Company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate properties, investments in joint ventures and other investments. The Companys reported net income is directly affected by managements estimate of impairments and or valuation allowances. Results of Operations Comparison 2006 to 2005 Revenues from rental property increased $88.3 million or 17.5% to $593.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with $505.6 million for the corresponding period ended December 31, 2005. This net increase resulted primarily from the combined effect of (i) the acquisition of operating properties during 2005 and 2006, providing incremental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 of approximately $72.3 million, (ii) an overall increase in shopping center portfolio occupancy to 95.5% at December 31, 2006, as compared to 94.6% at December 31, 2005 and the completion of certain redevelopment and development projects providing incremental revenues of approximately $33.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the corresponding period in 2005, offset by (iii) a decrease in revenues of approximately $17.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the corresponding period in 2005, resulting from the transfer of operating properties to various unconsolidated joint venture entities, tenant buyouts, and the sale of certain properties during 2005 and 2006. Rental property expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased approximately $67.4 million or 28.7% to $302.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared with $235.1 million for the corresponding year ended December 31, 2005. This increase is primarily due to operating property acquisitions during 2006 and 2005 which were partially offset by operating property dispositions including those transferred to various joint venture entities. Mortgage and other financing income decreased $8.8 million to $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $27.6 million for the corresponding period in 2005. This decrease is primarily due to the recognition in 2005 of a prepayment fee of $14.0 million received by the Company relating to the early repayment by Shopko of its outstanding loan with the Company, offset by accretion income of approximately $6.2 million received in 2006, resulting from an early pre payment of a mortgage receivable in June 2006, which had been acquired at a discount. Management and other fee income increased approximately $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the corresponding period in 2005. This increase is primarily due to incremental fees earned from the Kimsouth portfolio and growth in the Companys other co investment programs. General and administrative expenses increased approximately $20.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the corresponding period in 2005. This increase is primarily due to personnel related costs including the non cash expensing of stock options granted, attributable to the growth of the Company. Interest, dividends and other investment income increased approximately $26.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the corresponding period in 2005. This 48 Table of Contents increase is primarily due to greater realized gains on the sale of certain marketable securities and increased interest and dividend income as a result of higher cash balances and the growth in the marketable securities portfolio during 2006 and 2005. Interest expense increased $46.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the corresponding period in 2005. This increase is due to higher interest rates and higher outstanding levels of debt during this period as compared to the same period in the preceding year. Income from other real estate investments increased $20.3 million to $77.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $56.8 million for the corresponding period in 2005. This increase is primarily due to (i) increased investment in the Companys Preferred Equity program which contributed $40.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, including $12.2 million of profit participation earned from 16 capital transactions, as compared to $32.8 million for the corresponding period in 2005, including $12.6 million of profit participation earned from six capital transactions and (ii) pre tax profits of $7.9 million from the transfer of two properties from Kimsouth to a joint venture in which the Company has an 18% non controlling interest. These profits exclude amounts that have been deferred as a result of the Companys continued ownership interest. Equity in income of real estate joint ventures, net increased $29.5 million to $106.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $77.5 million for the corresponding period in 2005. This increase is primarily attributable to (i) increase in equity in income from the KROP primarily resulting from profit participation of approximately $22.2 million and gains from the sale of nine operating properties, one land parcel and one out parcel during 2006 of which the pro rata share of gains to the Company were $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, and (ii) the Companys growth of its various other real estate joint ventures. The Company has made additional capital investments in these and other joint ventures for the acquisition of additional shopping center properties by the ventures throughout 2005 and 2006. During 2006, KDI sold six recently completed projects, its partnership interest in one project and 30 out parcels, in separate transactions, for approximately $260.0 million. These sales resulted in gains of approximately $25.1 million, after income taxes of $12.2 million. These gains exclude approximately $1.1 million of gain relating to one project, which was deferred due to the Companys continued ownership interest. During 2005, KDI, sold in separate transactions, 41 out parcels and six recently completed projects for approximately $264.1 million. These sales provided gains of approximately $22.8 million, after income taxes of approximately $10.8 million. During 2006, the Company disposed of (i) 28 operating properties and one ground lease, for an aggregate sales price of $270.5 million, which resulted in an aggregate net gain of approximately $71.7 million, net of income taxes of $2.8 million relating to the sale of two properties, and (ii) transferred five operating properties, to joint ventures in which the Company has 20% non controlling interests for an aggregate price of approximately $95.4 million, which resulted in a gain of approximately $1.4 million from one transferred property. During 2005, the Company disposed of, in separate transactions, (i) 20 operating properties for an aggregate sales price of approximately $93.3 million, (ii) transferred three operating properties to KROP for an aggregate price of approximately $49.0 million, and (iii) transferred 52 operating properties to various joint ventures in which the Company has non controlling interests ranging from 15% to 50% for an aggregate price of approximately $183.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2005, these transactions resulted in gains of approximately $31.9 million and a loss on sale/transfer from four of the properties for $5.2 million. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $428.3 million. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $363.6 million. On a diluted per share basis, net income improved $0.18 to $1.70 for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $1.52 for the corresponding period in 2005. These increases are attributable to (i) an increase in revenues from rental properties primarily due to acquisitions in 2005 and 2006, (ii) increased income from other real estate investments primarily due to increased investments in the Companys Preferred Equity program, (iii) an increase in equity in income of real estate joint ventures achieved from profit participation and gains on sale of joint venture operating properties and additional capital investment in the Companys joint venture programs for the acquisition of additional operating properties throughout 2006 and 2005, (iv) increased gains on sales of operating properties in 2006 and (v) increased income contributed from the marketable securities portfolio in 2006 as compared to 2005, 49 Table of Contents partially offset by, (vi) an increase in interest expense due to higher interest rates and increased borrowings during 2006. Comparison 2005 to 2004 Revenues from rental property increased $14.7 million or 3.0% to $505.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared with $490.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. This net increase resulted primarily from the combined effect of (i) acquisitions during 2005 and 2004 providing incremental revenues of $33.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, and (ii) an overall increase in shopping center portfolio occupancy to 94.6% at December 31, 2005, as compared to 93.6% at December 31, 2004 and the completion of certain redevelopment projects and tenant buyouts providing incremental revenues of approximately $18.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the corresponding period in 2004, offset by (iii) a decrease in revenues of approximately $37.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the corresponding period in 2004, resulting from the sale of certain properties and the transfer of operating properties to various unconsolidated joint venture entities during 2005 and 2004. Rental property expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased approximately $13.5 million or 6.1% to $235.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared with $221.6 million for the preceding year. These increases are primarily due to operating property acquisitions during 2005 and 2004, which were partially offset by property dispositions and operating properties transferred to various unconsolidated joint venture entities. Mortgage and other financing income increased $12.6 million to $27.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. This increase primarily relates to a $14.0 million prepayment fee received by the Company relating to the early repayment by Shopko of its outstanding loan with the Company. Management and other fee income increased approximately $5.0 million to $30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $25.5 million in the corresponding period in 2004. This increase is primarily due to incremental fees earned from growth in the co investment programs. General and administrative expenses increased approximately $13.3 million to $56.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $43.5 million in the preceding calendar year. This increase is primarily due to (i) a $1.4 million increase in professional fees, due in part to compliance with section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, (ii) a $3.0 million increase due to the non cash expensing of the value attributable to stock options granted and (iii) increased personnel and systems related costs associated with the growth of the Company. Interest, dividends and other investment income increased approximately $9.6 million to $28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $18.7 million in 2004. This increase is primarily due to greater dividend income and realized gains on the sale of certain marketable securities during 2005 as compared to the preceding year. Interest expense increased $20.7 million to $126.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared with $106.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. This increase is primarily due to an overall increase in average borrowings outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the preceding year, resulting from the funding of investment activity during 2005. Income from other real estate investments increased $26.6 million to $56.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $30.1 million for the preceding year. This increase is primarily due to increased investment in the Companys Preferred Equity program, which contributed income of $32.8 million during 2005, including an aggregate of approximately $12.6 million of profit participation earned from six capital transactions during 2005, as compared to $11.4 million in 2004. Equity in income of real estate joint ventures, net increased $21.1 million to $77.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared with $56.4 million for the corresponding period in 2004. This increase is primarily attributable to (i) the increased equity in income from KIR resulting from the sale of two operating properties during 2005 which provided an aggregate gain of $20.2 million, of which the pro rata share to the Company was $8.7 million, (ii) increased equity in income in three 50 Table of Contents joint venture investments resulting from the sale of two operating properties and one development property during 2005, which provided aggregate gains of approximately $17.9 million, of which the pro rata share to the Company was approximately $8.8 million, and (iii) the Companys growth of its various other real estate joint ventures. The Company has made additional capital investments in these and other joint ventures for the acquisition of additional shopping center properties throughout 2005 and 2004. During 2005, KDI, the Companys wholly owned development taxable REIT subsidiary, in separate transactions, sold six completed projects and 41 out parcels for approximately $264.1 million. These sales provided gains of approximately $22.8 million, after income taxes of approximately $10.8 million. During 2004, KDI, in separate transactions, sold five completed projects, three completed phases of projects and 28 out parcels for approximately $169.4 million.

During 2005, the Company (i) disposed of, in separate transactions, 20 operating properties for an aggregate sales price of approximately $93.3 million, (ii) transferred three operating properties to KROP for an aggregate price of approximately $49.0 million, (iii) transferred 52 operating properties to various joint ventures in which the Company has non controlling interests ranging from 15% to 50% for an aggregate price of approximately $183.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2005, these transactions resulted in gains of approximately $31.9 million and a loss on sale/transfer from four of the properties for $5.2 million. During 2004, the Company (i) disposed of, in separate transactions, 16 operating properties and one ground lease for an aggregate sales price of approximately $81.1 million, including the assignment of approximately $8.0 million of non recourse mortgage debt encumbering one of the properties; cash proceeds of approximately $16.9 million from the sale of two of these properties were used in a 1031 exchange to acquire shopping center properties located in Roanoke, VA, and Tempe, AZ, (ii) transferred 17 operating properties to KROP for an aggregate price of approximately $197.9 million and (iii) transferred 21 operating properties to various co investment ventures in which the Company has non controlling interests ranging from 10% to 30% for an aggregate price of approximately $491.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2004, these dispositions resulted in gains of approximately $15.8 million and a loss on sale from three of the properties of approximately $5.1 million. As part of the Companys periodic assessment of its real estate properties with regard to both the extent to which such assets are consistent with the Companys long term real estate investment objectives and the performance and prospects of each asset, the Company determined in 2004 that its investment in an operating property comprised of approximately 0.1 million square feet of GLA, with a net book value of $3.8 million, might not be fully recoverable. Based upon managements assessment of current market conditions and lack of demand for the property, the Company reduced its anticipated holding period of this investment. As a result of the reduction in the anticipated holding period, together with reassessment of the potential future operating cash flow for the property and the effects of current market conditions, the Company determined that its investment in this asset was not fully recoverable and recorded an adjustment of property carrying value of approximately $3.0 million in 2004. This adjustment was included, along with the related property operations in the line Income from discontinued operating properties, in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2005, was $363.6 million, compared to $297.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. On a diluted per share basis, net income increased $0.26 to $1.52 for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $1.26 for the previous year. This increase is attributable to (i) increased income from other real estate investments, primarily from the Companys Preferred Equity program, (ii) an increase in equity in income of real estate joint ventures achieved from gains on sales of joint venture operating properties and additional capital investments in the Companys joint venture programs for the acquisition of additional shopping center properties throughout 2005 and 2004, (iii) increased income contributed from mortgage and other financing receivables as compared to last year and (iv) increased gains on sale/transfer of development and operating properties during 2005, as compared to the same period during 2004. Tenant Concentrations The Company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing risks through diversification achieved by the geographic distribution of its properties, avoiding dependence on any 51 Table of Contents single property, and a large tenant base. At December 31, 2006, the Companys five largest tenants were The Home Depot, TJX Companies, Sears Holdings, Kohls and Wal Mart, which represented approximately 3.5%, 2.9%, 2.5%, 2.2% and 2.1%, respectively, of the Companys annualized base rental revenues, including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the Company has less than a 100% economic interest. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys cash flow activities are summarized as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Net cash flow provided by operating activities $ 455.6 $ 410.8 $ 365.2 Net cash flow used for investing activities $ (246.2 ) $ (716.0 ) $ (299.6 ) Net cash flow provided by (used for) financing activities $ 59.4 $ 343.3 $ (75.6 ) Operating Activities The Company anticipates that cash flows from operations will continue to provide adequate capital to fund its operating and administrative expenses, regular debt service obligations and all dividend payments in accordance with REIT requirements in both the short term and long term. In addition, the Company anticipates that cash on hand, borrowings under its revolving credit facilities, issuance of equity and public debt, as well as other debt and equity alternatives, will provide the necessary capital required by the Company. Net cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2006, was primarily attributable to (i) cash flow from the diverse portfolio of rental properties, (ii) the acquisition of operating properties during 2005 and 2006, (iii) new leasing, expansion and re tenanting of core portfolio properties and (iv) growth in the Companys joint venture and Preferred Equity programs. Investing Activities Acquisitions and Redevelopments During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company expended approximately $484.8 million towards acquisition of and improvements to operating real estate. (See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K.) The Company has an ongoing program to reformat and re tenant its properties to maintain or enhance its competitive position in the marketplace. During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company expended approximately $62.2 million in connection with these major redevelopments and re tenanting projects. The Company anticipates its capital commitment toward these and other redevelopment projects during 2007 will be approximately $125.0 million to $150.0 million. The funding of these capital requirements will be provided by cash flow from operating activities and availability under the Companys revolving lines of credit. Investments and Advances to Real Estate Joint Ventures During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company expended approximately $472.7 million for investments and advances to real estate joint ventures and received approximately $183.4 million from reimbursements of advances to real estate joint ventures. (See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K.) Ground up Development The Company is engaged in ground up development projects which consists of (i) merchant building through the Companys wholly owned taxable REIT subsidiary, KDI, which develops neighborhood and community shopping centers and the subsequent sale thereof upon completion, (ii) U.S. ground up development projects which will be held as long term investments by the Company and (iii) various ground up development projects located in Mexico and Canada for long term investment. All ground up development projects generally have substantial pre leasing prior to the commencement of construction. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had in progress a total of 45 ground up development projects including 23 merchant building projects, six domestic ground up development projects, and 16 ground up development projects located throughout Mexico. 52 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company expended approximately $619.1 million in connection with the purchase of land and construction costs related to these projects and those sold during 2006. These projects are currently proceeding on schedule and substantially in line with the Companys budgeted costs. The Company anticipates its capital commitment during 2007 toward these and other development projects will be approximately $550 million to $600 million. The proceeds from the sales of the completed ground up development projects, proceeds from construction loans and availability under the Companys revolving lines of credit are expected to be sufficient to fund these anticipated capital requirements. (See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K.) Dispositions and Transfers During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $342.8 million relating to the sale of various operating properties and ground up development projects and approximately $1.2 billion from the transfer of operating properties to various joint ventures. (See Notes 3 and 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K.) Financing Activities It is managements intention that the Company continually have access to the capital resources necessary to expand and develop its business. As such, the Company intends to operate with and maintain a conservative capital structure with a level of debt to total market capitalization of 50% or less. As of December 31, 2006, the Companys level of debt to total market capitalization was 23%. In addition, the Company intends to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixed charge coverage ratios as part of its commitment to maintaining its investment grade debt ratings. The Company may, from time to time, seek to obtain funds through additional equity offerings, unsecured debt financings and or mortgage/construction loan financings and other capital alternatives in a manner consistent with its intention to operate with a conservative debt structure. Since the completion of the Companys IPO in 1991, the Company has utilized the public debt and equity markets as its principal source of capital for its expansion needs. Since the IPO, the Company has completed additional offerings of its public unsecured debt and equity, raising in the aggregate over $4.9 billion. Proceeds from public capital market activities have been used for the purposes of, among other things, repaying indebtedness, acquiring interests in neighborhood and community shopping centers, funding ground up development projects, expanding and improving properties in the portfolio and other investments. In March 2006, the Company was added to the S P 500 Index, an index containing the stock of 500 Large Cap corporations, most of which are U.S. corporations. The Company has an $850.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which is scheduled to expire in July 2008. This credit facility has made available funds to both finance the purchase of properties and other investments and meet any short term working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2006, there was no outstanding balance under this credit facility. The Company also has a three year CAD $250.0 million unsecured credit facility with a group of banks. This facility bore interest at the CDOR Rate, as defined, plus 0.50%, and is scheduled to expire in March 2008. During January 2006, the facility was further amended to reduce the borrowing spread to 0.45% and to modify the covenant package to conform to the Companys $850.0 million U.S. Credit Facility. Proceeds from this facility are used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of Canadian denominated investments. As of December 31, 2006, there was no outstanding balance under this credit facility. Additionally, the Company has a three year MXP 500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility. This facility bears interest at the TIIE Rate, as defined therein, plus 1.00% and is scheduled to expire in May 2008. Proceeds from this facility are used to fund peso denominated investments. As of December 31, 2006, there was no outstanding balance under this credit facility. The Company has a MTN program pursuant to which it may, from time to time, offer for sale its senior unsecured debt for any general corporate purposes, including (i) funding specific liquidity requirements in its business, including property acquisitions, development and redevelopment costs and (ii) managing the Companys debt maturities. (See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K.) During March 2006, the Company issued $300.0 million of fixed rate unsecured senior notes 53 Table of Contents under its MTN program. This fixed rate MTN matures March 15, 2016 and bears interest at 5.783% per annum. The proceeds from this MTN issuance were primarily used to repay a portion of the outstanding balance under the Companys U.S. revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. During June 2006, the Company entered into a third supplemental indenture, under the indenture governing its medium term notes and senior notes, which amended the (i) total debt test and secured debt test by changing the asset value definition from undepreciated real estate assets to total assets, with total assets being defined as undepreciated real estate assets, plus other assets (but excluding goodwill and amortized debt costs) and (ii) maintenance of unencumbered total asset value covenant by increasing the requirement of the ratio of unencumbered total asset value to outstanding unsecured debt from 1 to 1 to 1.5 to 1. Additionally, the same amended covenants were adopted within the Canadian supplemental indenture, which governs the 4.45% Canadian Debentures due in 2010. As a result of the amended covenants, the Company has increased its borrowing capacity by approximately $2.0 billion. During August 2006, Kimco North Trust III, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, completed the issuance of $200.0 million Canadian denominated senior unsecured notes. The notes bear interest at 5.18% and mature on August 16, 2013. The proceeds were used by Kimco North Trust III, to pay down outstanding indebtedness under existing credit facilities, to fund long term investments in Canadian real estate and for general corporate purposes. In connection with the October 31, 2006, Pan Pacific merger transaction, the Company assumed $650.0 million of unsecured notes payable, including $20.0 million of fair value debt premiums. These notes bear interest at fixed rates ranging from 4.70% to 7.95% per annum and have maturity dates ranging from June 29, 2007 to September 1, 2015 (see Recent Developments Operating Real Estate Joint Venture Investments Pan Pacific Retail Properties Inc. and Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K). During 2006, the Company repaid its $30.0 million 6.93% fixed rate notes, which matured on July 20, 2006, $100.0 million floating rate notes, which matured on August 1, 2006, and $55.0 million 7.50% fixed rate notes, which matured on November 5, 2006. In addition to the public equity and debt markets as capital sources, the Company may, from time to time, obtain mortgage financing on selected properties and construction loans to partially fund the capital needs of KDI. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had over 390 unencumbered property interests in its portfolio. During March 2006, the Company completed a primary public stock offering of 10,000,000 shares of Common Stock. The net proceeds from this sale of Common Stock, totaling approximately $405.5 million (after related transaction costs of $2.5 million) were primarily used to repay the outstanding balance under the Companys U.S. revolving credit facility, partial repayment of the outstanding balance under the Companys Canadian denominated credit facility and for general corporate purposes. During March 2006, the shareholders of Atlantic Realty approved a proposed merger with the Company, and the closing occurred on March 31, 2006. As consideration for this transaction, the Company issued Atlantic Realty shareholders 1,274,420 shares of Common Stock, excluding 748,510 shares of Common Stock that were to be received by the Company, at a price of $40.41 per share. (See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K.) During May 2006, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S 3ASR, which is effective for a term of three years, for the unlimited future offerings, from time to time, of debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock and common stock warrants. On September 25, 2006, Pan Pacific stockholders approved the proposed merger with the Company and the closing occurred on October 31, 2006. Under the terms of the merger agreement, the Company agreed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Pan Pacific for a total merger consideration of $70.00 per share. As permitted under the merger agreement, the Company elected to issue $10.00 per share of the total merger consideration in the form of Common Stock. As such, the Company issued 9,185,847 million shares of Common Stock valued at approximately $407.7 million (see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K). During 2006, the Company received approximately $43.8 million through employee stock option exercises and the dividend reinvestment program. 54 Table of Contents In connection with its intention to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Company expects to continue paying regular dividends to its stockholders. These dividends will be paid from operating cash flows, which are expected to increase due to property acquisitions, growth in operating income in the existing portfolio and from other investments. Since cash used to pay dividends reduces amounts available for capital investment, the Company generally intends to maintain a conservative dividend payout ratio, reserving such amounts as it considers necessary for the expansion and renovation of shopping centers in its portfolio, debt reduction, the acquisition of interests in new properties and other investments as suitable opportunities arise and such other factors as the Board of Directors considers appropriate. Cash dividends paid increased to $332.6 million in 2006, compared to $293.3 million in 2005 and $265.3 million in 2004. Although the Company receives substantially all of its rental payments on a monthly basis, it generally intends to continue paying dividends quarterly. Amounts accumulated in advance of each quarterly distribution will be invested by the Company in short term money market or other suitable instruments. Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments The Company has debt obligations relating to its revolving credit facilities, MTNs, senior notes, mortgages and construction loans with maturities ranging from less than one year to 29 years. As of December 31, 2006, the Companys total debt had a weighted average term to maturity of approximately 5.7 years. In addition, the Company has non cancelable operating leases pertaining to its shopping center portfolio. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has 82 shopping center properties that are subject to long term ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to the Company to construct and or operate a shopping center. In addition, the Company has 20 non cancelable operating leases pertaining to its retail store lease portfolio. The following table summarizes the Companys debt maturities and obligations under non cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2006 (in millions): 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Long Term Debt $ 457.0 $ 302.0 $ 254.5 $ 241.4 $ 410.2 $ 1,922.2 $ 3,587.3 Operating Leases Ground Leases $ 14.9 $ 14.8 $ 14.3 $ 12.4 $ 10.1 $ 175.8 $ 242.3 Retail Store Leases $ 4.6 $ 4.0 $ 3.6 $ 3.2 $ 2.6 $ 2.2 $ 20.2 The Company has $250.0 million of medium term notes, $42.8 million of mortgage debt and $164.2 million of construction loans maturing in 2007. The Company anticipates satisfying these maturities with a combination of operating cash flows, its unsecured revolving credit facilities, new debt issuances and the sale of completed ground up development projects. The Company has issued letters of credit in connection with completion and repayment guarantees for construction loans encumbering certain of the Companys ground up development projects and guaranty of payment related to the Companys insurance program. These letters of credit aggregate approximately $34.9 million. During October 2006, the Company closed on the Pan Pacific merger, which had a total value of approximately $4.1 billion. Funding for this transaction was provided by approximately $1.3 billion of new individual non recourse mortgage loans encumbering 51 properties, a $1.2 billion two year credit facility provided by a consortium of banks and guaranteed by the joint venture partners described below and the Company, the issuance of 9,185,847 shares of Common Stock valued at approximately $407.7 million, which was based upon the average closing price of Common Stock over the ten trading days immediately preceding the closing date, the assumption of approximately $630.0 million of unsecured bonds and approximately $289.4 million of existing non recourse mortgage debt encumbering 23 properties and approximately $300.0 million in cash. With respect to the $1.2 billion guarantee by the Company, PREI, as defined below, guaranteed reimbursement to the Company of 85% of any guaranty payment the Company is obligated to make. The Company evaluated this guarantee in connection with the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others and determined that the impact did not have a material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations. Immediately following the merger, the Company commenced its joint venture agreements with Prudential Real Estate Investors (PREI) through three separate accounts managed by PREI. In accordance with the joint venture agreements, all Pan Pacific assets and the approximate $1.6 billion of non recourse mortgage debt and the $1.2 billion credit 55 Table of Contents facility mentioned above were transferred to the separate accounts. PREI contributed approximately $1.1 billion on behalf of institutional investors in three of its portfolios. The Company holds 15% non controlling ownership interests in each of these joint ventures, with a total aggregate investment of approximately $194.8 million, and will account for these investments under the equity method of accounting. In addition, the Company will manage the portfolios and earn acquisition fees, leasing commissions, property management fees and construction management fees. During 2006, an entity in which the Company has a preferred equity investment, located in Montreal, Canada, obtained a non recourse construction loan, which is collateralized by the respective land and project improvements. Additionally, the Company has provided a guaranty to the lender and the developer partner has provided an indemnity to the Company for 25% of all debt. As of December 31, 2006, there was CAD $40.0 million (approximately USD $35.8 million) outstanding on this construction loan. Additionally, during 2006, KROP obtained a one year $15.0 million unsecured term loan, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.5%. This loan is guaranteed by the Company and GECRE has guaranteed reimbursement to the Company of 80% of any guaranty payment the Company is obligated to make. In connection with the construction of its development projects and related infrastructure, certain public agencies require performance and surety bonds be posted to guarantee that the Companys obligations are satisfied. These bonds expire upon the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. As of December 31, 2006, there were approximately $92.5 million bonds outstanding. Additionally, the RioCan Venture, an entity in which the Company holds a 50% non controlling interest, has a CAD $7.0 million (approximately USD $6.0 million) letter of credit facility. This facility is jointly guaranteed by RioCan and the Company and had approximately CAD $3.9 million (approximately USD $3.4 million) outstanding as of December 31, 2006, relating to various development projects. During 2005, a joint venture entity in which the Company has a non controlling interest obtained a CAD $22.5 million (approximately USD $19.3 million) credit facility to finance the construction of a 0.1 million square foot shopping center property located in Kamloops, B.C. This facility bears interest at Royal Bank Prime Rate (RBP) plus 0.5% per annum and is scheduled to mature in May 2007. The Company and its partner in this entity each have a limited and several guarantee of CAD $7.5 million (approximately USD $64.3 million) on this facility. As of December 31, 2006, there was CAD $21.0 million (approximately USD $18.0 million) outstanding on this facility. During 2005, PL Retail entered into a $39.5 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.675% and was scheduled to mature in February 2007. During 2007, the loan was extended to February 2008 at a reduced rate of LIBOR plus 0.45%. This facility is guaranteed by the Company and the joint venture partner has guaranteed reimbursement to the Company of 85% of any guaranty payment the Company is obligated to make. As of December 31, 2006, there was $39.5 million outstanding under this facility. Additionally, during 2005, the Company acquired three operating properties and one land parcel, through joint ventures, in which the Company holds 50% non controlling interests. Subsequent to these acquisitions, the joint ventures obtained four individual one year loans aggregating $20.4 million with interest rates ranging from LIBOR plus 0.50% to LIBOR plus 0.55%. During 2006, these term loans were extended for an additional year. These loans are jointly and severally guaranteed by the Company and the joint venture partner. During 2006, the Company obtained construction financing on three ground up development projects for an original loan commitment amount of up to $83.8 million of which approximately $36.0 million was outstanding at December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had a total of 13 construction loans with total commitments of up to $330.9 million of which $271.0 million had been funded to the Company. These loans had maturities ranging from two months to 31 months and interest rates ranging from 6.87% to 7.32% at December 31, 2006. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Ground Up Development Joint Ventures At December 31, 2006, the Company has three ground up development projects through unconsolidated joint ventures in which the Company has 50% non controlling interests. Two projects are financed with individual non recourse construction loans and one term loan with total aggregate loan commitments of up to $249.4 million of which $128.6 million has been funded. These loans have variable interest rates ranging from 5.82% to 8.25% at December 31, 2006, and maturities ranging from four months to 10 months. 56 Table of Contents Unconsolidated Real Estate Joint Ventures The Company has investments in various unconsolidated real estate joint ventures with varying structures. These joint ventures operate either shopping center properties or are established for development projects. Such arrangements are generally with third party institutional investors, local developers and individuals. The properties owned by the joint ventures are primarily financed with individual non recourse mortgage loans. Non recourse mortgage debt is generally defined as debt whereby the lenders sole recourse with respect to borrower defaults is limited to the value of the property collateralized by the mortgage. The lender generally does not have recourse against any other assets owned by the borrower or any of the constituent members of the borrower, except for certain specified exceptions listed in the particular loan documents (see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K). These investments include the following joint ventures: Non Recourse Weighted Kimco Mortgage Recourse Number of Average Average Ownership Number of Total GLA Payable Notes Payable Encumbered Interest Term Venture Interest Properties (in thousands) (in millions) (in millions) Properties Rate (months) KimPru 15.00 % 137 19,645 $ 1,545.1 $ 1,235.3 (c) 72 5.73 % 63.8 KIR 45.00 % 66 13,996 $ 1,080.7 $ 14.0 64 7.06 % 49.9 KROP 20.00 % 25 3,606 $ 318.9 (b) $ 15.0 (c) 25 6.30 % 41.8 PL Retail 15.00 % 23 5,809 $ 682.2 $ 39.5 (c) 23 6.48 % 30.7 KUBS 18.93 %(a) 31 4,994 $ 592.2 $ 31 5.59 % 96.7 RioCan Venture 50.00 % 34 8,140 $ 641.4 $ 34 6.32 % 69.9 (a) Ownership % is a blended rate. (b) KROP has entered into a series of interest rate cap agreements to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on its variable rate mortgage agreements. Such mortgage debt is collateralized by the individual shopping center property and is payable in monthly installments of principal and interest. (c) See Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments regarding guarantees by the Company and its joint venture partners. The Company has various other unconsolidated real estate joint ventures with varying structures. As of December 31, 2006, these unconsolidated joint ventures had individual non recourse mortgage loans aggregating approximately $2.2 billion. The Companys pro rata share of these non recourse mortgages was approximately $734.1 million. (See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10 K.) Other Real Estate Investments The Company maintains a Preferred Equity program, which provides capital to developers and owners of real estate properties. The Company accounts for its preferred equity investments under the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 2006, the Companys net investment under the Preferred Equity Program was approximately $400.4 million relating to 215 properties. As of December 31, 2006, these preferred equity investment properties had individual non recourse mortgage loans aggregating approximately $1.2 billion. Due to the Companys preferred position in these investments, the Companys pro rata share of each investment is subject to fluctuation and is dependent upon property cash flows. The Companys maximum exposure to losses associated with its preferred equity investments is primarily limited to its invested capital. During June 2002, the Company acquired a 90% equity participation interest in an existing leveraged lease of 30 properties. The properties are leased under a long term bond type net lease whose primary term expires in 2016, with the lessee having certain renewal option rights. The Companys cash equity investment was approximately $4.0 million. This equity investment is reported as a net investment in leveraged lease in accordance with SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases (as amended). The net investment in leveraged lease reflects the original cash investment adjusted by remaining net rentals, estimated unguaranteed residual value, unearned and deferred income, and deferred taxes relating to the investment. As of December 31, 2006, 16 of these properties were sold, whereby the proceeds from the sales were used to pay down the mortgage debt by approximately $29.1 million. As of 57 Table of Contents December 31, 2006, the remaining 14 properties were encumbered by third party non recourse debt of approximately $53.8 million that is scheduled to fully amortize during the primary term of the lease from a portion of the periodic net rents receivable under the net lease. As an equity participant in the leveraged lease, the Company has no recourse obligation for principal or interest payments on the debt, which is collateralized by a first mortgage lien on the properties and collateral assignment of the lease. Accordingly, this debt has been offset against the related net rental receivable under the lease. Effects of Inflation Many of the Companys leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation. Such provisions include clauses enabling the Company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants gross sales above pre determined thresholds, which generally increase as prices rise, and or escalation clauses, which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases. Such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices. In addition, many of the Companys leases are for terms of less than 10 years, which permits the Company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal. Most of the Companys leases require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance, thereby reducing the Companys exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. The Company periodically evaluates its exposure to short term interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and will, from time to time, enter into interest rate protection agreements and or foreign currency hedge agreements which mitigate, but do not eliminate, the effect of changes in interest rates on its floating rate debt and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (FIN 48), regarding accounting for and disclosure of uncertain tax positions. This guidance seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company is currently assessing the provisions of FIN 48, but does not expect its adoption to have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurement (SFAS No. 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurement. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The impact of adopting SFAS No. 157 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. Additionally in September 2006, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108), which provides interpretive guidance on how registrants should quantify financial statement misstatements. SAB 108 requires registrants to quantify misstatements using both balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relative quantitative and qualitative factors. For transition purposes, the registrants will be permitted to restate prior period financial statements or recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying SAB 108 through an adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the year of adoption. SAB 108 is effective for annual financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. The impact of adopting SAB 108 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In December 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. EITF 00 19 2, Accounting for Registration Payment Arrangements. EITF 00 19 2 addresses an issuers accounting for registration payment arrangements and specifies that the contingent obligation to make future payments or otherwise transfer consideration under a registration payment arrangement, whether issued as a separate agreement or included as a provision of a financial instrument or other agreement, should be separately recognized and measured in accordance with FASB Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. The guidance in EITF 00 19 2 amends FASB Statements No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging 58 Table of Contents Activities, No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity, and FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN 45), to include scope exceptions for registration payment arrangements. EITF 00 19 2 further clarifies that a financial instrument subject to a registration payment arrangement should be accounted for in accordance with other applicable generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) without regard to the contingent obligation to transfer consideration pursuant to the registration payment arrangement. EITF 00 19 2 shall be effective immediately for registration payment arrangements and the financial instruments subject to those arrangements that are entered into or modified subsequent to the date of issuance of this EITF, or for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect the adoption of EITF 00 19 2 to have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 159 on the Companys financial position or results of operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Companys primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. The following table presents the Companys aggregate fixed rate and variable rate domestic and foreign debt obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2006, with corresponding weighted average interest rates sorted by maturity date. The information is presented in U.S. dollar equivalents, which is the Companys reporting currency. The instruments actual cash flows are denominated in U.S. dollars and Canadian dollars, as indicated by geographic description ($USD equivalent in millions). Fair 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Total Value U.S. Dollar Denominated Secured Debt Fixed Rate $ 26.5 $ 94.8 $ 49.2 $ 19.9 $ 46.7 $ 304.5 $ 541.6 $ 555.6 Average Interest Rate 8.06 % 7.21 % 7.83 % 8.39 % 7.42 % 6.53 % 6.99 % Variable Rate $ 173.5 $ 81.5 $ 25.3 $ 16.4 $ $ 0.6 $ 297.3 $ 297.3 Average Interest Rate 7.22 % 7.04 % 6.91 % 7.35 % 8.25 % 7.15 % Unsecured Debt Fixed Rate $ 250.0 $ 125.7 $ 180.0 $ 76.5 $ 363.4 $ 1,445.7 $ 2,441.3 $ 2,457.9 Average Interest Rate 6.83 % 4.61 % 6.98 % 5.55 % 6.36 % 5.50 % 5.83 % Variable Rate $ 6.9 $ $ $ $ $ $ 6.9 $ 6.9 Average Interest Rate 8.00 % 8.00 % Fair 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Total Value Canadian Dollar Denominated Unsecured Debt Fixed Rate $ $ $ $ 128.6 $ $ 171.5 $ 300.1 $ 297.9 Average Interest Rate 4.45 % 5.18 % 4.87 % Based on the Companys variable rate debt balances, interest expense would have increased by approximately $3.0 million in 2006 if short term interest rates were 1.0% higher. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had Canadian investments totaling approximately CAD $801.3 million (approximately USD $687.2 million) comprised of real estate joint venture investments and marketable securities. In addition, the Company has Mexican real estate investments of approximately MXP 5.0 billion (approximately USD $463.2 million). The 59 Table of Contents foreign currency exchange risk has been partially mitigated through the use of local currency denominated debt, inflation adjusted leases, and a cross currency swap (the CC Swap). The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by the counter party to the CC Swap. The Company believes it has mitigated its credit risk by entering into the CC Swap with a major financial institution. The Company has not, and does not plan to, enter into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no other material exposure to market risk.
