ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. This discussion contains forward looking statements, which involve risk and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. (See Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements.) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We based these estimates and assumptions on historical experience, and evaluate them on an on going basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis, and the audit committee has reviewed the Companys related disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows: Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sale price is fixed or determinable, delivery has occurred or services rendered, and collectibility is reasonably assured. System revenue includes hardware and software that is incidental to the product. We generally recognize system revenue upon positive affirmation by the customer that the system has been installed and is operating according to pre determined specifications. This positive affirmation is generally evidenced by an acceptance document signed by the customer. In limited cases, we deviate from the need for written acceptance and recognize system revenue upon shipment. These exceptions have accounted for approximately 6.6%, 4.9%, and 3.1% of our revenue for the fiscal years ended 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in revenue exceptions results from multiple shipments of same tools that have already met the required acceptance criteria, to customers who are looking to expand capacity. (See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Revenue Recognition for detailed description of exceptions.) Shipping charges billed to customers are included in system revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of revenues. Revenue from software license fees is typically recognized upon shipment if collection of the resulting receivable is probable, the fee is fixed or determinable, and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate a portion of the total fee to any undelivered elements of the arrangement. Such undelivered elements in these arrangements typically consist of services and or upgrades. If vendor specific objective evidence does not exist for the undelivered elements of the arrangement, all revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist, or until all elements are delivered, whichever is earlier. In instances where an arrangement to deliver software requires significant modification or customization, license fees are recognized under the percentage of completion method of contract accounting. Allowances are established for potential product returns and credit losses. Spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped, risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable. 25 Service and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract. If maintenance is included in an arrangement, which includes a software license agreement, amounts related to maintenance are allocated based on vendor specific objective evidence. Consulting and training revenue is recognized when the related services are performed. The deferred system profit balance as of June 30, 2005 was $210 million. This amount equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment less applicable product and warranty costs. The deferred profit balance decreased from $285 million at June 30, 2004 primarily because shipments were lower than customer acceptance for which revenue was recognized during fiscal year 2005. We also defer the fair value of non standard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue. Non standard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40 hour per week coverage for twelve months. Non standard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences. The unearned revenue balance increased to $80 million at June 30, 2005 from $57 million at June 30, 2004 primarily due to an increase in service contracts as our installed base of equipment at customers sites continues to increase. Inventory Reserves We review the adequacy of our inventory reserves on a quarterly basis. For production inventory, our methodology involves matching our on hand and on order inventory with our build forecast over the next twelve months. We then evaluate the parts found to be in excess of the twelve month demand and take appropriate reserves to reflect the risk of obsolescence. For spare parts inventory, we match our on hand inventory against twenty four months of usage. We then evaluate the parts in excess of the twenty four month usage and take appropriate reserves to reflect risk of obsolescence. Both methodologies are significantly affected by the usage assumption. The longer the time period of estimated usage, the lower the reserves are required. Based on our past experience, we believe the twelve month/twenty four month time periods best reflect the reasonable and relative obsolescence risks. If actual demand or usage were to be substantially lower than estimated, additional inventory adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Inventory reserves, once established, are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts A majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world. In order to monitor potential credit losses, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for potential credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of all accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed periodically to assess the adequacy of the allowance. We take into consideration (1) any circumstances of which we are aware of a customers inability to meet its financial obligations; and (2) our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers. If circumstances change, and the financial condition of our customers were adversely affected resulting in their inability to meet their financial obligations to us, we may need to take additional allowances, which would result in a reduction of our net income. Warranty We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to cost of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. Utilizing actual service records, we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge. We update these estimated charges every quarter. The actual product performance and or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty 26 reserves accordingly. The difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions for which there is limited or no historical product performance on which to base the estimated warranty expense; more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates. Non standard warranty generally includes services incremental to the standard 40 hour per week coverage for twelve months. Non standard warranty is deferred as unearned revenue and is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences. Contingencies and Litigation We are named from time to time as a party to various legal proceedings. While we currently believe the ultimate outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. We would accrue the cost of an adverse judgment if, in our estimation, the adverse settlement is probable and we can reasonably estimate the ultimate cost to us. We have made no such accruals as of June 30, 2005. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, (SFAS No. 109) which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We have determined that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover all of our deferred tax assets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we could be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not probable. On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an annual effective income tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. We carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional tax payments are probable. If we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. We record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be. 27 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY KLA Tencor Corporation is the worlds leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related microelectronics industries. Our portfolio of products, software, analysis, services and expertise is designed to help integrated circuit manufacturers manage yield throughout the entire wafer fabrication process from research and development to final mass production yield analysis. Net sales, income from operations, net income, cash flow from operations, and diluted earnings per share are the key indicators we use to monitor our financial condition and operating performance. We also use certain non GAAP measures such as net orders to assess business trends and performance, and to forecast and plan future operations. Net orders consist of current period orders less current period cancellations. The following table sets forth the key quarterly financial information which we use to manage our business (in millions, except per share data). First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Fiscal year 2005 Revenues $ 519 $ 533 $ 541 $ 492 Income from operations $ 157 $ 156 $ 155 $ 115 Net income $ 117 $ 122 $ 123 $ 105 Cash flow from operations $ 91 $ 81 $ 182 $ 153 Net orders $ 529 $ 479 $ 422 $ 426 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.58 $ 0.61 $ 0.61 $ 0.52 Fiscal year 2004 Revenues $ 318 $ 339 $ 390 $ 450 Income from operations $ 37 $ 51 $ 88 $ 121 Net income $ 37 $ 45 $ 66 $ 96 Cash flow from operations $ 30 $ 33 $ 90 $ 197 Net orders $ 340 $ 508 $ 599 $ 607 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.18 $ 0.22 $ 0.33 $ 0.48 Fiscal year 2003 Revenues $ 376 $ 335 $ 304 $ 308 Income from operations $ 57 $ 27 $ 26 $ 29 Net income $ 51 $ 29 $ 27 $ 30 Cash flow from operations $ 65 $ 33 $ 89 $ 59 Net orders $ 242 $ 286 $ 316 $ 337 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.26 $ 0.15 $ 0.14 $ 0.15 Outlook The semiconductor industry grew almost 30% while the semiconductor equipment industry grew 60% in calendar year 2004. Analysts are forecasting semiconductor revenue growth to slow to approximately 5% and semiconductor equipment revenues to decline by approximately 5% in calendar year 2005. New system and service orders on a fiscal basis, which are new orders net of cancellations, declined sequentially by approximately $198 million or 10% in the year ended June 30, 2005, compared to the previous fiscal year due to near term weakness in demand for semiconductor capital equipment. 28 Over the longer term, we expect process control to continue to represent a higher percentage of our customers capital spending. We believe this increase in process control spending will be driven by the demand for more precise diagnostics capabilities to address multiple new defects as a result of further shrinking of device feature sizes, the transition to copper and other new materials, and the transition to new 300 millimeter fabs. We anticipate these factors will drive increased demand for our products and services. New system and service net orders by region were as follows (in millions): Fiscal Year 2005 Fiscal Quarter 2005 First Second Third Fourth United States $ 436 $ 107 $ 98 $ 96 $ 135 Europe & Israel 211 79 53 36 43 Japan 540 123 157 121 139 Taiwan 308 90 66 104 48 Korea 243 91 57 58 37 Asia Pacific 118 39 48 7 24 Net orders $ 1,856 $ 529 $ 479 $ 422 $ 426 Fiscal Year 2004 Fiscal Quarter 2004 First Second Third Fourth United States $ 550 $ 71 $ 129 $ 192 $ 158 Europe & Israel 247 21 75 70 81 Japan 438 80 128 92 138 Taiwan 449 96 89 97 167 Korea 145 23 21 74 27 Asia Pacific 225 49 66 74 36 Net orders $ 2,054 $ 340 $ 508 $ 599 $ 607 Fiscal Year 2003 Fiscal Quarter 2003 First Second Third Fourth United States $ 374 $ 80 $ 92 $ 98 $ 104 Europe & Israel 167 30 58 40 39 Japan 289 57 67 64 101 Taiwan 135 46 17 44 28 Korea 106 21 38 29 18 Asia Pacific 110 8 14 41 47 Net orders $ 1,181 $ 242 $ 286 $ 316 $ 337 29 Orders received in a particular quarter affect revenue recognized in subsequent quarters. Net orders turn to revenue upon positive affirmation by the customer that the system has been installed and is operating according to predetermined specifications. Our backlog for unshipped system orders as of June 30, 2005 was approximately $646 million, a majority of which we expect to ship over the next six to nine months. In addition, as of June 30, 2005 there was $531 million that is related to products that have been delivered but are awaiting written acceptance from the customer. Results of Operations Revenues and Gross Margin Fiscal year ended June 30, (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Revenues: Product $ 1,770 $ 1,200 $ 1,060 Service 315 297 263 Total revenues $ 2,085 $ 1,497 $ 1,323 Gross margin $ 1,223 $ 827 $ 652 Gross margin percentage 59 % 55 % 49 % Product revenues Product revenue in fiscal year 2005 increased $570 million, or 48% to $1.8 billion, from $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2004. Product revenue in fiscal year 2004 increased $140 million, or 13% to $1.2 billion, from $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2003. Product revenue increases in fiscal year 2005 and 2004 were primarily the result of fulfilling higher level of orders received in prior periods as a result of increased capital spending by our customers. Our customers increased capital spending in the area of process control and yield management is due to the increasing complexity of processing in their fabs as more complex chips are produced, new materials such as copper are introduced and device feature sizes are reduced. Service revenues Service revenue in fiscal year 2005 increased $18 million, or 6% to $315 million, from $297 million in fiscal year 2004. Service revenue in fiscal year 2004 increased $34 million, or 13% to $297 million, from $263 million in fiscal year 2003. Service revenue is generated from maintenance service contracts, as well as time and material billable service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period. Service revenue continued to increase in absolute terms throughout the three year period as our installed base of equipment at our customers sites continued to grow. The amount of service revenue generated is generally a function of the number of post warranty systems installed at our customers sites and the degree of utilization of those systems. 30 Revenues by region Revenues by region for the periods indicated were as follows (in millions): Fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 2004 2003 United States $ 497 24 % $ 343 23 % $ 407 31 % Europe & Israel 266 13 % 186 12 % 193 15 % Japan 450 21 % 395 26 % 277 21 % Taiwan 430 21 % 263 18 % 253 19 % Korea 148 7 % 144 10 % 76 6 % Asia Pacific 294 14 % 166 11 % 117 8 % Total $ 2,085 100 % $ 1,497 100 % $ 1,323 100 % International revenues were 76%, 77% and 69% of revenue during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. A significant portion of our revenue continues to be generated outside the United States where a significant portion of the worlds semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located. Gross margin Gross margin improved by 4 points to 59% during fiscal year 2005 from 55% during fiscal year 2004. Gross margin improved by 6 points to 55% during fiscal year 2004 from 49% during fiscal year 2003. The improvement over the last two fiscal years can be attributed to the lower cost of building, installing and maintaining our products, combined with an increase in our revenues. Our gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product mix, and is affected by variations in costs related to manufacturing and servicing our products. Engineering, Research and Development (R&D) Fiscal year ended June 30, (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Net R&D expenses $ 340 $ 281 $ 268 Percentage of total revenues 16 % 19 % 20 % Net R&D expenses increased $59 million or 21% to $340 million during fiscal year 2005 from $281 million during fiscal year 2004. Net R&D expenses increased $13 million or 5% to $281 million during fiscal year 2004 from $268 million during fiscal year 2003. The gross dollars for R&D investment were partially offset by $8 million, $11 million and $18 million of external funding received during the fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, for certain strategic development programs conducted with several of our customers and from government grants. The businesses acquired during this fiscal year contributed $23 million of the increase in net R&D expenses during fiscal year 2005.
