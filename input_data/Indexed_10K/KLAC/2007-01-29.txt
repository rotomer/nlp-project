ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. This discussion contains forward looking statements, which involve risk and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. (See Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements.) Restatements of Consolidated Financial Statements and Special Committee and Company Findings Special Committee Investigation of Historical Stock Option Practices On May 22, 2006, the Wall Street Journal published an article about stock option backdating that questioned the stock option practices at several companies, including KLA Tencor. On May 23, 2006, we received a subpoena from the United States Attorneys Office for the Northern District of California (USAO) and a letter of inquiry from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding our stock option practices. Later on May 23, 2006, our Board of Directors appointed a Special Committee composed solely of independent directors to conduct a comprehensive investigation of our historical stock option practices. The Special Committee promptly engaged independent legal counsel and accounting experts to assist with the investigation. The investigation included an extensive review of our historical stock option practices, accounting policies, accounting records, supporting documentation, email communications and other documentation, as well as interviews of a number of current and former directors, officers and employees. On September 27, 2006, the Special Committee reported the bulk of its findings and recommendations to our Board of Directors. Findings and Remedial Actions On September 28, 2006, we announced that we would have to restate our previously issued financial statements to correct our past accounting for stock options. As a result of the Special Committee investigation, we discovered that certain of our stock options, primarily those granted from July 1, 1997 to June 30, 2002, had been retroactively priced for all employees who received these grants. This means that the option exercise price was not the market price of the option shares on the actual grant date of the option, but instead was a lower market price on an earlier date. The actual grant date when the essential actions necessary to grant the option were completed, including the final determination of the number of shares to be granted to each employee and the exercise price is the correct measurement date to determine the market price of the option shares under the accounting rules in effect at the time. More than 95% of the total in the money value (market price on the actual grant date minus exercise price) of all of our retroactively priced options was attributable to those granted from July 1, 1997 to June 30, 2002. We previously applied Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related Interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, through our fiscal year ended June 30, 2005. Under APB Opinion No. 25, a non cash, stock based compensation expense was required to be recognized for any option for which the exercise price was below the market price on the actual grant date. Because each of our retroactively priced options had an exercise price below the market price on the actual grant date, there should have been a non cash charge for each of these options under APB Opinion No. 25 equal to the number of option shares, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price and the market price on the actual grant date. That expense should have been amortized over the vesting period of the option. Starting in our fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. As a result, beginning in fiscal year 2006, the additional stock based compensation expense required to be recorded for each retroactively priced option is equal to the incremental fair value of the option on the actual grant date, 33 Table of Contents amortized over the remaining vesting period of the option. We did not record these stock based compensation expenses under APB Opinion No. 25 or SFAS No. 123(R) related to our retroactively priced options in our previously issued financial statements, and that is why we are restating them in this filing. To correct our past accounting for stock options, we recorded additional pre tax, non cash, stock based compensation expense of (a) $348 million for the periods July 1, 1994 to June 30, 2005 under APB Opinion No. 25 and (b) $22 million for the year ended June 30, 2006 under SFAS No. 123(R). We expect to amortize an additional $6 million of such pre tax charges under SFAS No. 123(R) in future periods to properly account for past retroactively priced stock options. By October 16, 2006, the Special Committee had substantially completed its investigation. The Special Committee concluded that (1) there was retroactive pricing of stock options granted to all employees who received options, primarily during the periods from July 1, 1997 to June 30, 2002 (less than 15% of these options were granted to executive officers), (2) the retroactively priced options were not accounted for correctly in our previously issued financial statements, (3) the retroactive pricing of options was intentional, not inadvertent or through administrative error, (4) the retroactive pricing of options involved the selection of fortuitously low exercise prices by certain former executive officers, and other former executives may have been aware of this conduct, (5) the retroactive pricing of options involved the falsification of Company records, resulting in erroneous statements being made in financial and other reports previously filed with the SEC, as well as in information previously provided to our independent registered public accounting firm, and (6) in most instances, the retroactive pricing of options violated the terms of our stock option plans. Because virtually all holders of retroactively priced options issued by the Company were not involved in or aware of the retroactive pricing, the Board of Directors decided that we should continue to honor the options that violated the terms of our stock option plans, except in certain individual cases as described below. The Special Committee concluded that, with a few immaterial exceptions, the retroactive pricing of stock options stopped after June 30, 2002. After that time, there were procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that stock options were priced on the grant date. The Special Committee also concluded that none of our independent Directors was involved in or aware of the retroactive pricing of stock options. Based on the Special Committees report, our Board of Directors concluded that no current members of management were involved in the retroactive pricing of stock options. During its investigation of our historical stock option practices, the Special Committee did not find evidence of any other financial reporting or accounting issues. As a result of the Special Committee investigation, on October 16, 2006, we terminated our employment relationship and agreement with Kenneth L. Schroeder, and we announced our intent to cancel all outstanding stock options held by Mr. Schroeder that were retroactively priced or otherwise improperly granted. Those options were canceled in December 2006. Mr. Schroeder was the Companys Chief Executive Officer and a member of its Board of Directors from mid 1999 until January 1, 2006, and was a member of the Companys stock option committee from 1994 until December 31, 2005. From January 1, 2006 to October 16, 2006, Mr. Schroeder was employed as a Senior Advisor to the Company. On November 10, 2006, Mr. Schroeders counsel informed us that Mr. Schroeder contests our right to terminate his employment relationship and agreement and to cancel any of his options. We intend to vigorously defend any claims that may be made by Mr. Schroeder regarding these matters, which could involve a material amount. Also on October 16, 2006, Stuart J. Nichols, Vice President and General Counsel, resigned. Mr. Nichols and we entered into a Separation Agreement and General Release under which Mr. Nichols outstanding retroactively priced stock options have been re priced by increasing the exercise price to the market price of the option shares on the actual grant date. Under SFAS No. 123(R), no incremental charge will be recognized in the financial statements for the quarter ended December 31, 2006. On October 16, 2006, Kenneth Levy, Founder and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, retired as a director and employee, and was named Chairman Emeritus by our Board of Directors. Mr. Levy and we entered into a Separation Agreement and General Release under which Mr. Levys outstanding retroactively 34 Table of Contents priced stock options have been re priced by increasing the exercise price to the market price of the option shares on the actual grant date. Under SFAS No. 123(R), no incremental charge will be recognized in the financial statements for the quarter ended December 31, 2006. Mr. Levy was the Companys Chief Executive Officer from 1975 until mid 1999 (with the exception of mid 1997 to mid 1998), was a member of the Companys Board of Directors from 1975 until his retirement, was Chairman of the Board of Directors from 1999 until his retirement, and was a member of the Companys stock option committee from 1994 until use of that committee was suspended in the fall of 2006. On December 21, 2006, Jon D. Tompkins resigned as a director of the Company, and we agreed to modify the outstanding options held by Mr. Tompkins (all of which were fully vested) to extend the post termination exercisability period to December 31, 2007, which is the last day of the calendar year in which those options would have terminated in the absence of such extension. Mr. Tompkins, the Chief Executive Officer of Tencor Instruments before its merger into the Company in mid 1997, was the Companys Chief Executive Officer from mid 1997 to mid 1998, was a member of the Companys stock option committee from mid 1997 until mid 1999, and was a member of the Companys Board of Directors from mid 1997 until his resignation. Although the Board of Directors concluded that John H. Kispert, our President and Chief Operating Officer, was not involved in and was not aware of the improper stock option practices, based on the Special Committees recommendation, his outstanding retroactively priced options have been re priced because he served as Chief Financial Officer during part of the period in question. This re pricing involved increasing the exercise price to the market price of the option shares on the actual grant date. Under SFAS No. 123(R), no incremental charge will be recognized in the financial statements for the quarter ended December 31, 2006. Restatement and Impact on Financial Statements In addition to restating the consolidated financial statements in response to the Special Committees findings, we are recording additional non cash adjustments that were previously considered to be immaterial relating primarily to the accounting for the employee stock purchase plan, corrections for the recognition of deferred tax assets, the release of tax reserves, the timing of revenue recognition, gains and losses on hedging contracts and the calculation of minority interest. We have also corrected the classification of certain amounts presented as cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities relating to investments in Variable Rate Demand Notes. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2004 and prior, we previously recorded no stock based compensation expense; therefore, the additional stock based compensation expense noted below represents the total stock based compensation expense for these periods. For the year ended June 30, 2005, we recorded $2.9 million of stock based compensation with a related tax benefit of $1.1 million in our previously reported financial statements. For fiscal 2005, total stock based compensation was $37.0 million with a related tax benefit of $12.1 million. The income statement impact of the restatement is as follows (in thousands): Years ended June 30, Total effect atJune 30, 2005 2005 2004 Cumulativeeffect atJuly 1, 2003 2003 2002 Net income, as previously reported $ 466,695 $ 243,701 $ 137,191 $ 216,166 Additional compensation expense resulting from improper measurement dates for stock option grants $ (347,817 ) (34,086 ) (53,208 ) $ (260,523 ) (70,032 ) (76,582 ) Tax related effects 117,776 12,149 22,320 83,307 22,866 25,009 Additional compensation expense resulting from improper measurement dates for stock option grants, net of tax (230,041 ) (21,937 ) (30,888 ) (177,216 ) (47,166 ) (51,573 ) Other adjustments, net of tax (991 ) 291 (337 ) (945 ) 3,970 1,091 Total decrease to net income $ (231,032 ) (21,646 ) (31,225 ) $ (178,161 ) (43,196 ) (50,482 ) Net income, as restated $ 445,049 $ 212,476 $ 93,995 $ 165,684 35 Table of Contents Years ended June 30, 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 1996 1995 Additional compensation expense resulting from improper measurement dates for stock option grants $ (59,261 ) $ (23,296 ) $ (17,630 ) $ (5,219 ) $ (2,852 ) $ (2,747 ) $ (2,904 ) Tax related effects 17,262 7,198 6,054 1,861 1,036 983 1,038 Additional compensation expense resulting from improper measurement dates for stock option grants, net of tax $ (41,999 ) $ (16,098 ) $ (11,576 ) $ (3,358 ) $ (1,816 ) $ (1,764 ) $ (1,866 ) We adopted SFAS No. 123(R) effective July 1, 2005. The grant date fair values of stock options granted prior to fiscal year 2006 were changed as a result of the findings that certain stock option grants were retroactively priced. This change resulted in additional stock based compensation expense of $22 million and a related tax benefit of $12 million being recognized in fiscal year 2006 under SFAS No. 123(R). Government Inquiries Relating to Historical Stock Option Practices We are cooperating fully with the USAO and SEC inquiries and intend to continue to do so. These inquiries likely will require us to expend significant management time and incur significant legal and other expenses, and could result in civil and criminal actions seeking, among other things, injunctions against the Company and the payment of significant fines and penalties by the Company, which may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. We cannot predict how long it will take or how much more time and resources we will have to expend to resolve these government inquiries, nor can we predict the outcome of these inquiries. Late SEC Filings and Nasdaq Delisting Proceedings Due to the Special Committee investigation and the resulting restatements, we did not file on time this Annual Report on Form 10 K and our Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2006. As a result, we received two Nasdaq Staff Determination letters, dated September 14, 2006 and November 14, 2006, respectively, stating that we were not in compliance with the filing requirements of Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) and, therefore, that our stock was subject to delisting from the Nasdaq Global Select Market. We appealed this determination, attended a hearing, and obtained approval of our request for continued listing of our stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, subject to the condition that we file this Report and our Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 on or before January 31, 2007. With the filing of this Report and our Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2006, we believe we have returned to full compliance with SEC reporting requirements and Nasdaq listing requirements, and, therefore, that the Nasdaq delisting matter is now closed. However, SEC comments on these Reports (or other reports that we previously filed) or other factors could render us unable to maintain an effective listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market or any other national securities exchange. Shareholder Litigation Relating to Historical Stock Option Practices Several derivative actions have been filed purporting to assert claims on behalf of and in the name of the Company against various of our current and former directors and officers relating to our accounting for stock options issued from 1994 to the present. The complaints in these actions allege that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties and other obligations to the Company and violated state and federal securities laws in connection with our historical stock option granting process, our accounting for past stock options, and historical sales of stock by the individual defendants. On behalf of KLA Tencor, the plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary and other relief against the named defendants. The derivative actions are at an early stage. Our Board of Directors has appointed a Special Litigation Committee (SLC) composed solely of independent directors to 36 Table of Contents conduct an independent investigation of the claims asserted in the derivative actions and to determine the Companys position with respect to those claims. The SLCs investigation is in progress. We cannot predict whether these actions are likely to result in any material recovery by or expense to KLA Tencor. KLA Tencor and various of our current and former directors and officers were named as defendants in several putative securities class action lawsuits that have been consolidated into one action. The complaints allege claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a result of our past stock option grants and related accounting and reporting, and seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief. The plaintiffs seek to represent a class consisting of purchasers of KLA Tencor stock between February 13, 2001 and May 22, 2006 who allegedly suffered losses as a result of material misrepresentations in KLA Tencors SEC filings during that period. This litigation is at an early stage. One of the derivative actions noted above also includes a putative class action claim on behalf of KLA Tencor shareholders against the Company and certain of our current and former directors and officers alleging that shareholders incurred damage due to purported dilution of KLA Tencor common stock resulting from historical stock option granting practices. The Company intends to vigorously defend these litigations. We cannot predict the outcome of the shareholder class action cases described above and we cannot estimate the likelihood or potential dollar amount of any adverse results. However, an unfavorable outcome in this litigation could have a material adverse impact upon the financial position, results of operations or cash flows for the period in which the outcome occurs and in future periods. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We based these estimates and assumptions on historical experience, and evaluate them on an on going basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the Companys related disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows: Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. A majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world. In order to monitor potential credit losses, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for potential credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of all accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance. We take into consideration (1) any circumstances of which we are aware of a customers inability to meet its financial obligations; and (2) our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers. If circumstances change, and the financial condition of our customers are adversely affected and unable to meet their financial obligations to us, we may need to take additional allowances, which would result in a reduction of our net income. Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first in, first out basis) or market. Demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and reserves are recorded to state the demonstration units at their net realizable value. We review the adequacy of its inventory reserves on a quarterly basis. We review and set standard costs semi annually at current manufacturing costs in order to approximate actual costs. Our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage) are recognized as current period charges. We write down inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence. These factors 37 Table of Contents are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values. Warranty. We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. Utilizing actual service records, we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge. We update these estimated charges on a quarterly basis. The actual product performance and or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty reserves accordingly. The difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited or no historical product performance to estimate warranty expense; more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates. Non standard warranty generally includes services incremental to the standard 40 hour per week coverage for twelve months. Non standard warranty is deferred as unearned revenue and is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences. See Note 12 to Consolidated Financial Statements Commitments and Contingencies for a detailed description. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sale price is fixed or determinable, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, and collectibility is reasonably assured. System revenue includes hardware and software that is incidental to the product. We generally recognize system revenue upon confirmation by the customer that the system has been installed and is operating according to pre determined specifications. In certain cases, our policy does not require written acceptance from the customer and we recognize system revenue upon shipment. Total revenue recognized without a written acceptance from the customer was approximately 4.4%, 6.6%, and 4.9% of total revenue for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The fluctuation of revenue exceptions is primarily driven by the shipment patterns of tools that have already met the required acceptance criteria. (See Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements under Revenue Recognition for detailed description of exceptions.) Shipping charges billed to customers are included in system revenue and the related shipping costs are included in costs of revenues. Revenue from software license fees is typically recognized upon shipment if collection of the resulting receivable is probable, the fee is fixed or determinable, and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate a portion of the total fee to any undelivered elements of the arrangement. Such undelivered elements in these arrangements typically consist of services and or unspecified software upgrades. If vendor specific objective evidence does not exist for the undelivered elements of the arrangement, all revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist, or until all elements are delivered, whichever is earlier. In instances where an arrangement to deliver software requires significant modification or customization, license fees are recognized under the percentage of completion method of contract accounting. We periodically review the software element of our systems in accordance with AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition and Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03 05, Applicability of SOP 97 2 to Non Software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing More Than Incidental Software. Trade in rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection with subsequent purchases. We estimate the value of the trade in right and reduce the revenue of the initial sale. Spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped, risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable. Service and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract. If maintenance is included in an arrangement, which includes a software license agreement, amounts related to 38 Table of Contents maintenance are allocated based on vendor specific objective evidence. Consulting and training revenue is recognized when the related services are performed. The deferred system profit balance at June 30, 2006 was $226 million. This amount equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment less applicable product and warranty costs. The deferred profit balance increased from $212 million at June 30, 2005 primarily because shipments were higher than customer acceptance for which revenue was recognized during fiscal year 2006. We also defer the fair value of non standard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue. Non standard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40 hour per week coverage for twelve months. Non standard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences. The unearned revenue balance was flat at $81 million at June 30, 2006 and 2005. Stock Based Compensation. Prior to July 1, 2005, we applied APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related Interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. In accordance with APB Opinion No. 25, a non cash, stock based compensation expense was recognized for any options for which the exercise price was below the market price on the actual grant date. The charge for the options with an exercise price below the market price on the actual grant date was equal to the number of options multiplied by the difference between the exercise price and the market price of the option shares on the actual grant date. That expense was amortized over the vesting period of the option. Beginning July 1, 2005, we have accounted for stock based compensation using the fair value of stock options using a Black Scholes valuation model, consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107. We elected to adopt the modified prospective application method as provided by SFAS No. 123(R). Accordingly, during fiscal year 2006, we recorded stock based compensation cost totaling the amount that would have been recognized had the fair value method under SFAS No. 123 been applied since the effective date of SFAS No. 123 for the pre fiscal 2006 grants and under SFAS No. 123(R) for the fiscal year 2006 grants. SFAS No. 123(R) requires the use of option pricing models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options. The Black Scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short lived exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the options expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock. The expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using the implied volatility of the Companys common stock. We determined that implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than a blended volatility. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we used a combination of historical and implied volatility in deriving the expected volatility assumption. In November 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. 123(R) 3, Transition Election Related to Accounting for Tax Effects of Share Based Payment Awards (FSP 123R 3). We have elected not to adopt the alternative transition method provided in the FSP 123R 3 for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to SFAS No. 123(R). We followed paragraph 81 of SFAS No. 123(R) to calculate the initial pool of excess tax benefits and to determine the subsequent impact on the Additional Paid In Capital (APIC) pool and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of the tax effects of employee stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). See Note 7 to Consolidated Financial Statements Stock Based Compensation for a detailed description. Contingencies and Litigation. The Company is subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company accrues a liability and charges operations for the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date. See Note 12 to Consolidated Financial Statements Commitments and Contingencies for a detailed description. 39 Table of Contents Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We have determined that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover all of our deferred tax assets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we could be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not probable. On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. We carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional tax payments are probable. If we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. We record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be. See Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements Income Taxes for a detailed description. Effects of Recent Accounting Pronouncements. In September 2006, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements. SAB No. 108 was issued in order to eliminate the diversity of practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements. SAB No. 108 requires registrants to quantify the impact of correcting all misstatements using both the rollover method, which focuses primarily on the impact of a misstatement on the income statement and is the method we currently use, and the iron curtain method, which focuses primarily on the effect of correcting the period end balance sheet. The use of both of these methods is referred to as the dual approach and should be combined with the evaluation of qualitative elements surrounding the errors in accordance with SAB No. 99, Materiality. The provisions of SAB No. 108 are effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning July 1, 2006. The adoption of SAB No. 108 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 are effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning July 1, 2008. We are evaluating the impact of the provisions of this statement on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans. SFAS No. 158 requires employers to fully recognize the obligations associated with single employer defined benefit pension, retiree healthcare and other postretirement plans in their financial statements. The provisions of SFAS No. 158 are effective for the Company as of the end of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2007. We are evaluating the impact of the provisions of this statement on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 40 Table of Contents In June 2006, the FASB published FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This Interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This Interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. This Interpretation is effective for the Company in fiscal years beginning July 1, 2007. We are evaluating the impact of the provisions of this Interpretation on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments, an amendment of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. This Statement permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation. This Statement is effective for the Company for all financial instruments acquired or issued after July 1, 2007. The adoption of SFAS No. 155 is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In June 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes, and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements. SFAS No. 154 changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. Previously, most voluntary changes in accounting principles required recognition via a cumulative effect adjustment within net income of the period of the change. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS No. 154 is effective for the Company for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning July 1, 2006; however, the Statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements. The adoption of SFAS No. 154 is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In March 2005, the FASB published FIN 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, which clarifies that the term, conditional asset retirement obligation, as used in SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and (or) method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. The uncertainty about the timing and (or) method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists. The Interpretation also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. The adoption of this Interpretation did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29. SFAS No. 153 addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets and redefines the scope of transactions that should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. SFAS No. 153 is effective for the Company for nonmonetary asset exchanges beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The adoption of SFAS No. 153 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS No. 151 clarifies that abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage) are required to be recognized as current period charges. The provisions of SFAS No.151 are effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning July 1, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 151 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 41 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE SUMMARY KLA Tencor Corporation is the worlds leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related microelectronics industries. Our portfolio of products, software, analysis, services and expertise is designed to help integrated circuit manufacturers manage yield throughout the entire wafer fabrication process from research and development to final mass production yield analysis. Revenues, income from operations, net income, cash flow from operations, and diluted earnings per share are some of the key indicators we use to monitor our financial condition and operating performance. The following table sets forth some of the key quarterly unaudited financial information which we use to manage our business. See Exhibit 99.1 for further detail of the impact of the restatements on these quarterly results.

Over the longer term, we expect process control to continue to represent a higher percentage of our customers capital spending. We believe this percentage increase in process control spending will be driven by the demand for more precise diagnostics capabilities to address multiple new defects as a result of further shrinking of device feature sizes, the transition to new materials, new devices and circuit architecture, new lithography challenges and fab process innovation. We anticipate these factors will drive increased demand for our products and services. The key drivers for growth in the semiconductor equipment industry in calendar year 2007 are the transition to 300 millimeter fabs, the increased demand for consumer electronics and the strength of the NAND flash market. 42 Table of Contents Revenues and Gross Margin Fiscal Year Ended June 30, (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 As restated As restated Revenues: Product $ 1,713 $ 1,768 $ 1,200 Service 358 314 297 Total revenues $ 2,071 $ 2,082 $ 1,497 Costs of revenues $ 942 $ 871 $ 684 Stock based compensation expense included in costs of revenues $ 30 $ 9 $ 11 Gross margin percentage 55 % 58 % 54 % Stock based compensation expense included in costs of revenues as a percentage of revenue 1 % 0 % 1 % Product revenues For the year ended June 30, 2006 Product revenue in fiscal year 2006 decreased $55 million, or 3%, to $1.7 billion, from $1.8 billion in fiscal year 2005. Product revenue in fiscal year 2005 increased $568 million, or 47% to $1.8 billion, from $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2004. Product revenue increased in fiscal year 2005 primarily as a result of fulfilling a higher level of orders received in prior periods. Our customers increased capital spending in the area of process control and yield management is due to the increasing complexity of processing in their fabs as more complex chips are produced, new materials such as copper are introduced and device feature sizes are reduced. Per our revenue recognition policy, we do not require written acceptance from the customer under certain situations. Revenue recognized under conditions where our policy does not require the need for a written acceptance by the customer was approximately 4.4%, 6.6% and 4.9% of total revenue for fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Service revenues Service revenue in fiscal year 2006 increased $44 million, or 14% to $358 million, from $314 million in fiscal year 2005. Service revenue in fiscal year 2005 increased $17 million, or 6% to $314 million, from $297 million in fiscal year 2004. Service revenue is generated from maintenance service contracts, as well as time and material billable service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period. Service revenue continued to increase through the three year period as our installed base of equipment at our customers sites continued to grow. The amount of service revenue generated is generally a function of the number of post warranty systems installed at our customers sites and the utilization of those systems. 43 Table of Contents Revenues by region Revenues by region for the periods indicated were as follows (in millions): Fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 2005 2004 As restated As restated United States $ 417 20 % $ 494 24 % $ 343 23 % Europe & Israel 288 14 266 13 186 12 Japan 541 26 450 21 395 26 Taiwan 363 18 430 21 263 18 Korea 277 13 148 7 144 10 Asia Pacific 185 9 294 14 166 11 Total $ 2,071 100 % $ 2,082 100 % $ 1,497 100 % International revenues were 80%, 76% and 77% of revenue during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. A significant portion of our revenue continues to be generated in Asia where a substantial portion of the worlds semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located. Gross margin Our gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product mix, and is affected by variations in costs related to manufacturing and servicing our products. Gross margin decreased by 3 points to 55% during fiscal year 2006 from 58% during fiscal year 2005 primarily due to cessation of development work related to CDSEM and stock based compensation expense recorded during fiscal year 2006, which contributed 1% and 1%, respectively, to the decrease in gross margin. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, we ceased development work on the next generation equipment for CDSEM and incurred charges of $27 million related to write offs of inventory as well as for liabilities incurred related to the decision to cease future development of CDSEM. Although we have ceased future development of CDSEM, we will continue to service previously sold equipment. Gross margin improved by 4 points to 58% in fiscal year 2005 relative to 54% in fiscal year 2004 due to lower cost of building, installing and maintaining our products, combined with an increase in revenues. Engineering, Research and Development (R&D) Fiscal year ended June 30, (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 As restated As restated R&D expenses $ 394 $ 352 $ 299 Stock based compensation expense included in R&D expenses $ 50 $ 12 $ 18 R&D expenses as a percentage of total revenues 19 % 17 % 20 % Stock based compensation expense included in R&D expenses as a percentage of total revenues 2 % 1 % 1 % R&D expenses increased $42 million or 12% to $394 million during fiscal year 2006 from $352 million during fiscal year 2005. R&D expenses increased $53 million or 18% to $352 million during fiscal year 2005 from $299 million during fiscal year 2004. The increase in R&D expenses in 2006 is primarily attributable to increased stock based compensation expenses. In addition, the increase in R&D expenses compared to fiscal year 2004 is due to the business acquired during 2005. Note, however, that R&D expenses, as a percentage of total revenues, decreased from fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2005 as a result of higher total revenues during fiscal year 2005. 44 Table of Contents R&D expenses include the benefit of $11 million, $8 million and $11 million of external funding received during the fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, for certain strategic development programs conducted with several of our customers and from government grants. We expect our R&D expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we accelerate our investments in critical programs focusing on new technologies and enhancements to existing products. Our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace. To do this, we believe that we must continue to make substantial investments in our research and development. We remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the yield challenges our customers face at future technology nodes. Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Fiscal year ended June 30, (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 As restated As restated SG&A expenses $ 425 $ 314 $ 271 Stock based compensation expense included in SG&A expenses $ 86 $ 16 $ 24 SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues 21 % 15 % 18 % Stock based compensation expense included in SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues 4 % 1 % 2 % SG&A expenses increased $111 million or 35% to $425 million during fiscal year 2006 from $314 million during the fiscal year 2005. SG&A expenses increased $43 million or 16% to $314 million during fiscal year 2005 from $271 million during fiscal year 2004. The increase in SG&A expenses from fiscal year 2005 to fiscal year 2006 is primarily due to higher levels of stock based compensation expense; increased compensation expense of $70 million and increased legal costs of $21 attributable to accrued expenses related to the stock option investigation. The increase in SG&A expenses from fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2005 is primarily due to higher compensation costs associated with an increase in customer application support, increased staffing and consolidating the results of operations of the entities acquired during fiscal year 2005. During November 2005, we announced that effective January 1, 2006, Kenneth L. Schroeder would cease to be our Chief Executive Officer and would thereafter be employed as a Senior Advisor. The Company and Mr. Schroeder also revised his prior agreement with the Company and defined the salary, bonus payout and equity award vesting during the period of his employment as a Senior Advisor. Effective January 1, 2006, we determined that all service conditions associated with certain prior equity awards under the terms of the revised agreement with Mr. Schroeder had been satisfied; accordingly, we recorded at that time an additional non cash, stock based compensation charge of approximately $9.8 million relating to these equity awards. The above mentioned charge is included as a component of Selling, General and Administrative expense during fiscal 2006. On October 16, 2006, following the Special Committee investigation of our historical stock option practices, we terminated all aspects of Mr. Schroeders employment relationship and agreement with the Company. As a result, vesting of Mr. Schroeders then outstanding stock options and restricted stock awards immediately ceased, and the 890,914 unvested option shares and 100,000 unvested restricted stock award shares held by Mr. Schroeder at the time of termination were canceled. Accordingly, in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 we will reverse approximately $20 million of the non cash, stock based compensation charge recorded in prior periods. In December 2006, we canceled 596,740 vested option shares held by Mr. Schroeder as of the time of termination, representing those shares that had been retroactively priced or otherwise improperly granted. 45 Table of Contents In November 2006, as part of the long term business plan, we decided to sell certain real estate properties owned by the Company in San Jose, California and Livermore, California. We will record an asset impairment charge of approximately $56 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2006. In addition, we reduced our work force by approximately 150 people and will accrue approximately $10 million in severance charges in the quarter ended December 31, 2006 to be paid over the next twelve months. Interest Income and Other, Net Fiscal year ended June 30, (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 As restated As restated Interest income and other, net $ 68 $ 38 $ 27 Percentage of total revenues 3 % 2 % 2 % Interest income and other, net is comprised primarily of interest income earned on the investment and cash portfolio, realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities, as well as income recognized upon settlement of certain foreign currency contracts. The increase in interest income and other, net, compared to the prior fiscal years is primarily due to the increase in cash levels and short term interest rates. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 0.4%, 24.3% and 21.4% in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In general, our effective income tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 35% largely as a function of benefits realized from our Extraterritorial Income (ETI) exclusion, research and development tax credits and tax exempt interest. In the year ended June 30, 2006, the Company reduced its total income tax reserves by $79.7 million, of which $44.8 million relates to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006. This was primarily due to expiring statute of limitations, several tax settlements reached with various tax authorities and reassessments of tax exposures based on the status of current audits in various jurisdictions. Included in the tax settlements, was a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service related to an examination for the years ended June 30, 2003 and 2004. Our benefits for income taxes related to equity awards were $58.2 million, $12.1 million and $22.3 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2006, June 30, 2005 and June 30, 2004, respectively. Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre tax income, non tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions, amounts of tax exempt interest income and research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pre tax income, and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. The Internal Revenue Service completed an audit of the Companys fiscal year 2003 and 2004 corporate tax returns. Liabilities for anticipated worldwide tax audit issues have been established based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional tax payments are probable. The Company believes that adequate reserves have been provided to cover any potential additional tax assessments. Equity Incentive Program The Companys equity incentive program is a broad based, long term retention program that is intended to attract and retain key employees, and align stockholder and employee interests. The equity incentive program consists of two plans: one under which non employee directors may be granted options to purchase shares of our stock, and another in which non employee directors, officers, key employees, consultants and all other employees may be granted options to purchase shares of our stock, restricted stock units and other types of equity awards. For the past several years, except for the retroactively priced stock options, stock options have generally been granted at market price of our common stock on the date of grant, generally have a vesting period of five 46 Table of Contents years and are exercisable for a period not to exceed seven years (ten years for options granted prior to July 1, 2005) from the date of issuance. Restricted stock units may be granted with varying criteria such as time based or performance based vesting. Substantially all of our employees that meet established performance goals and qualify as key employees participate in our main equity incentive plan. On October 18, 2004, the Companys stockholders approved the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2004 Plan) which provides for the grant of options to purchase shares of the Companys common stock, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance shares, performance units and deferred stock units to our employees, consultants and members of our Board of Directors. Since the adoption of the 2004 Plan, no further grants are permitted under the 1982 Stock Option Plan or 2000 Non Statutory Stock Option Plan. The 2004 Plan permits the issuance of 12,500,000 shares of common stock, of which 6.3 million shares are available for grant as of June 30, 2006. At that date, awards for 30.4 million shares are outstanding under all plans. Stock Based Compensation Expense Effective July 1, 2005, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. SFAS No. 123(R) establishes accounting for stock based awards exchanged for employee services. Accordingly, stock based compensation cost is measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the award which is computed using a Black Scholes option valuation model, and is recognized as expense over the employees requisite service period. During fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004, we recorded stock based compensation expense of $165 million, $37 million, and $53 million, respectively, of which, $22 million, $34 million, and $53 million was attributable to the restatements. Compensation expense recognized for all stock options for fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $141 million, $35 million, and $53 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2006, the unrecognized stock based compensation after estimated forfeitures related to stock options was $223 million and is expected to be recognized over an estimated weighted average amortization period of 3.3 years. Compensation expense recognized in connection with the employee stock purchase plan for fiscal year 2006 was $16 million, the majority of which is included in selling, general and administration expense. As the plan was non compensatory under APB Opinion No. 25, no compensation expense was recorded in connection with the plan in fiscal years 2005 and 2004. Compensation expense recognized for restricted stock units for fiscal years 2006 and 2005 was $8 million and $2 million, respectively. No compensation expense was recognized in fiscal year 2004. As of June 30, 2006, the unrecognized stock based compensation after estimated forfeitures related to restricted stock units was $26 million. That cost is expected to be recognized over an estimated weighted average amortization period of 3.7 years. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of June 30, (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,129 $ 663 $ 354 Short term marketable securities 1,197 1,532 779 Long term marketable securities 743 Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 2,326 $ 2,195 $ 1,876 Percentage of total assets 51 % 54 % 52 % 47 Table of Contents We have historically financed our operations through cash generated from operations. Cash provided by operating activities was $315 million, $507 million, and $350 million in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2006 consisted primarily of net income of $380 million increased by non cash depreciation and amortization of $69 million, stock based compensation of $165 million, tax benefit from equity awards of $32 million and an increase in accounts payable of $27 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $115 million, an increase in inventories of $88 million, and an increase in net deferred income tax assets of $134 million. Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2005 consisted primarily of net income of $445 million increased by non cash depreciation and amortization of $70 million, stock based compensation of $37 million, decrease in accounts receivable of $37 million and decrease in other assets and liabilities of $43 million partially offset by a decrease in deferred system profit of $71 million and an increase in net deferred income tax assets of $53 million. Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2004 consisted primarily of net income of $212 million, increased by non cash depreciation and amortization of $82 million, stock based compensation of $53 million, tax benefit from equity awards of $40 million, an increase in deferred system profit of $107 million and an increase in accounts payable of $30 million partially offset by an increase in other assets and liabilities of $87 million, an increase in net deferred income tax assets of $29 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $149 million and an increase in inventories of $76 million. Cash provided by investing activities was $225 million in fiscal year 2006. Cash used in investing activities was $125 million and $441 million in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively. Investing activities typically consist of purchases and sales or maturities of marketable securities, purchases of capital assets to support long term growth and acquisitions of technology or other companies to allow access to new markets or emerging technologies. Cash used in financing activities was $85 million and $81 million in fiscal years 2006 and 2005, compared with $113 million of cash generated from financing activities in fiscal year 2004. Financing activities include dividend payments to our common stockholders and sales and repurchases of our common stock. Issuance of common stock provided $213 million, $134 million and $169 million in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We used $221 million, $204 million and $56 million in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, to repurchase shares of our common stock under the stock repurchase program initiated in 1997. The stock repurchase program was suspended in May 2006. We anticipate resuming repurchases under the program in calendar 2007. During the third quarter of fiscal 2005, our Board of Directors also approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend and declared a dividend of 12 cents per share of our outstanding common stock. The total amount of dividends paid during the fiscal years 2006 and 2005 was $95 million and $24 million, respectively. Further, the dividend of 12 cents per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 was declared on August 3, 2006 and was paid on September 1, 2006 to our stockholders on record as of August 15, 2006. The total amount of dividends paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 was approximately $24 million. In addition, the dividend of 12 cents per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 was declared on November 6, 2006 and was paid on December 1, 2006 to our stockholders on record as of November 15, 2006. The total amount of dividends paid in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 was $24 million. On October 11, 2006, we acquired all of the shares of ADE Corporation (ADE), a supplier of semiconductor process control solutions. Per the Amended Merger Agreement between the Company and ADE, we paid $482 million (which included goodwill and intangibles of $262 million and $137 million, respectively) in cash to the shareholders of ADE. The acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase. 48 Table of Contents The following is a schedule summarizing our significant obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of June 30, 2006 (in millions): Total Payments Due by Fiscal Year 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Operating leases $ 19.7 $ 6.5 $ 4.6 $ 3.4 $ 1.9 $ 1.3 $ 2.0 Cash purchase of ADE $ 482.0 $ 482.0 Total contractual cash obligations $ 501.7 $ 488.5 $ 4.6 $ 3.4 $ 1.9 $ 1.3 $ 2.0 We have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse. During the years ended June 30, 2006 and 2005, approximately $278 million and $306 million of receivables were sold under these arrangements, respectively. In addition, from time to time we will discount without recourse, Letters of Credit (LCs) received from customers in payment of goods. During the years ended June 30, 2006 and 2005, several LCs were sold with proceeds totaling $69 million and $30 million, respectively. Discounting fees were $0.8 million and $0.2 million for the years ended June 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We maintain $25 million of short term credit facilities in various locations to fund overdraft, Customs guarantee for VAT, and letter of credit needs of our subsidiaries in Europe and Asia. A total of $20 million was outstanding under these facilities as of June 30, 2006. We maintain certain purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply chain for key components. Our liability in these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecast time horizon can vary among different suppliers. We estimate our purchase commitment as of June 30, 2006 to be approximately $210 million, most of which we expect to spend in fiscal year 2007. Actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may change in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. Certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties. We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. The actual product performance and or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty reserves accordingly. The difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited or no historical product performance to estimate warranty expense; more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates. Non standard warranty coverage generally includes services incremental to the standard 40 hour per week coverage for twelve months. See Note 12 to Consolidated Financial Statements Commitments and Contingencies for a detailed description. We are involved in several litigation cases as described in Note 12 to Consolidated Financial Statements. We cannot predict the outcome of these cases and we cannot estimate the likelihood or potential dollar amount of any adverse results. Working capital increased to $2.5 billion as of June 30, 2006, compared to $2.3 billion at June 30, 2005. At June 30, 2006, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $2.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business, and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity 49 Table of Contents provided by existing cash balances, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Under our foreign currency risk management strategy, we utilize derivative instruments to protect our interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates. This financial exposure is monitored and managed as an integral part of our overall risk management program which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. We continue our policy of hedging our current and anticipated foreign currency exposures with hedging instruments having tenors of up to twelve months. At June 30, 2006, we had cash flow hedge contracts, maturing throughout fiscal year 2007 to sell $167.5 million and purchase $15.2 million, in foreign currency, primarily in Japanese Yen. At June 30, 2006, we had other foreign currency hedge contracts maturing throughout fiscal year 2007 to sell $260.2 million and purchase $128.4 million, in foreign currency, primarily in Japanese Yen. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. To mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency hedges. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position at June 30, 2006. Actual results may differ materially. As of June 30, 2006, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of $1.2 billion, excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents (detail of these securities is included in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements found under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report on Form 10 K). These securities, as with all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10% from levels as of June 30, 2006, the fair value of the portfolio would decline by $7 million. As of June 30, 2006, we had net forward contracts to sell $284 million in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures (detail of these contracts and Hedging Activities is included in Note 13 to Consolidated Financial Statements under Derivative Instruments). If we had entered into these contracts on June 30, 2006, the U.S. dollar equivalent would be $288 million. A 10% adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by $39 million. However, if this occurred, the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount. Accordingly, we believe that the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure should have no material impact on income or cash flows. 50 Table of Contents
