ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. This discussion contains forward looking statements, which involve risk and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. (See Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements.) Restatements of Prior Period Consolidated Financial Statements in Previous Filings In our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 (filed on January 29, 2007) and our quarterly reports on Form 10 Q for the quarters ended September 30, 2006, December 31, 2006 and March 31, 2007 (filed on January 29, 2007, February 9, 2007 and May 7, 2007, respectively), we restated (1) our consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2005 and 2004; (2) our selected consolidated financial data as of and for our fiscal years ended June 30, 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002; and (3) our unaudited quarterly financial data for the first three quarters in our fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 and for all quarters in our fiscal year ended June 30, 2005. In those filings, to correct our past accounting for stock options, we recorded total additional pre tax, non cash, stock based compensation expense of $375.7 million for periods from July 1, 1994 to June 30, 2007. All financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K reflects that restatement and does not contain any further restatement. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We based these estimates and assumptions on historical experience, and evaluate them on an on going basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the Companys related disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows: Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the sellers price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. We derive revenue from three sources system sales, spare part sales and service contracts. We typically recognize revenue for system sales upon acceptance by the customer that the system has been installed and is operating according to predetermined specifications. We also recognize revenue prior to written acceptance from the customer, as follows: When system sales to independent distributors have no installation requirement, contain no acceptance agreement, and 100% payment is due upon shipment, revenue is recognized upon shipment; When the installation of the system is deemed perfunctory, revenue is recognized upon shipment. The portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation; When the customer fab has already accepted the same tool, with the same specifications, and it can be objectively demonstrated that the tool meets all of the required acceptance criteria upon shipment, revenue is recognized upon shipment. The portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation; 31 Table of Contents When the customer withholds signature on our acceptance document due to issues unrelated to product performance, revenue is recognized when the system is performing as intended and meets all published and contractually agreed specifications; When the system is damaged during transit, revenue is recognized upon receipt of cash payment from the customer. Total revenue recognized without a written acceptance from the customer was approximately 13.5%, 4.4% and 6.6% of total revenues for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005 respectively. The increase in revenue recognized without a written acceptance is primarily driven by increased shipments of tools that have already met the required acceptance criteria at those customer fabs, and an increase in sales of systems with perfunctory installation. Shipping charges billed to customers are included in system revenue, and the related shipping costs are included in costs of revenues. Trade in rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection with subsequent purchases. We estimate the value of the trade in right and reduce the revenue of the initial sale. This amount is recognized at the earlier of the exercise of the trade in right or the expiration of the trade in right. Spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped, risk of loss has passed to the customer, and collection of the resulting receivable is probable. Service and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract. Consulting and training revenue is recognized when the related services are performed. The deferred system profit balance equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment less applicable product and warranty costs. We also defer the fair value of non standard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue. Non standard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40 hour per week coverage for twelve months. Non standard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences. Software is incidental to our products as determined in accordance with AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition and Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03 05, Applicability of SOP 97 2 to Non Software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing More Than Incidental Software. We periodically review the software element of our systems in accordance with SOP No. 97 2 and EITF Issue No. 03 05. Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first in, first out basis) or market. Demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost, and reserves are recorded to state the demonstration units at their net realizable value. We review the adequacy of our inventory reserves on a quarterly basis. We review and set standard costs semi annually at current manufacturing costs in order to approximate actual costs. Our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage) are recognized as current period charges. We write down inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence. These factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand, and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values. 32 Table of Contents Warranty. We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. Utilizing actual service records, we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge. We update these estimated charges on a quarterly basis. The actual product performance and or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty reserves accordingly. The difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited or no historical product performance to estimate warranty expense; more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates. Non standard warranty generally includes services incremental to the standard 40 hour per week coverage for twelve months. Non standard warranty is deferred as unearned revenue and is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences. See Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. A majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world. In order to monitor potential credit losses, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of all accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance. We take into consideration (1) any circumstances of which we are aware of a customers inability to meet its financial obligations; and (2) our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers. If circumstances change, and the financial condition of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us, we may need to take additional allowances, which would result in a reduction of our net income. Stock Based Compensation. Beginning July 1, 2005, we have accounted for stock based compensation using the fair value of stock options based on a Black Scholes option pricing model, consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), as clarified by Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107. We elected to adopt the modified prospective application method as provided by SFAS No. 123(R). Accordingly, during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2006 and 2007, we recorded stock based compensation expense totaling the amount that would have been recognized had the fair value method been applied under SFAS No. 123 since the effective date of SFAS No. 123 for the grants made prior to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, and under SFAS No. 123(R) for the grants made during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2006 and 2007. SFAS No. 123(R) requires the use of option pricing models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options. The Black Scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short lived exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the options expected life and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock. The expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using the implied volatility of the Companys common stock. We determined that implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than a blended volatility. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we used a combination of historical and implied volatility in deriving the expected volatility assumption. In November 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position No. 123(R) 3 Transition Election Related to Accounting for Tax Effects of Share Based Payment Awards (FSP 123R 3). We have elected not to adopt the alternative transition method provided in the FSP 123R 3 for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to SFAS No. 123(R). We followed paragraph 81 of SFAS No. 123(R) to calculate the initial pool of excess tax benefits and to determine the subsequent impact on the Additional Paid in Capital (APIC) pool and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of the tax effects of 33 Table of Contents employee stock based compensation awards that were outstanding upon adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). We have elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of share based compensation deductions when calculating the windfall benefits and are recognizing the full effect of these deductions in the income statement in the period in which the taxable event occurs. See Note 6, Stock Based Compensation to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Contingencies and Litigation. We are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. As required by SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment tests annually, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair value based approach. Purchased technology, patents, trademarks and other intangible assets are presented at cost, net of accumulated amortization. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis which approximates their estimated useful lives and assessed for impairment under SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination. We completed the annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit during the quarter ended December 31, 2006, and concluded that there was no impairment. There have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to the impairment test performed in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We have determined that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover all of our deferred tax assets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we could be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not probable. On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. We carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our best estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional tax payments are probable. If we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. We record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be. 34 Table of Contents Effects of Recent Accounting Pronouncements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115, which is effective for the Company in fiscal years beginning July 1, 2008. This statement permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates. Subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be reported in earnings. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this statement on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 are effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning July 1, 2008. We are evaluating the impact of the provisions of this statement on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In June 2006, the FASB published FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for our Company in fiscal years beginning July 1, 2007. Any differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of FIN 48 and the amounts reported after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings. In addition, the adoption of FIN 48 will result in the reclassification of certain unrecognized tax benefits from current to non current liabilities in our statement of financial position. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the implementation of FIN 48 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments, an amendment of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. These Statements permit fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation. These Statements are effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after July 1, 2007. The adoption of SFAS No. 155 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 35 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE SUMMARY KLA Tencor Corporation is the worlds leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related microelectronics industries. Our comprehensive portfolio of products, services, software and expertise helps integrated circuit manufacturers manage yield throughout the entire fabrication process from research and development to final volume production. Revenues, income from operations, net income, cash flow from operations, and diluted earnings per share are some of the key indicators we use to monitor our financial condition and operating performance. The following table sets forth some of the key quarterly unaudited financial information which we use to manage our business. (in thousands, except per share data) First quarter endedSeptember 30,2006 Second quarter endedDecember 31,2006 ThirdquarterendedMarch 31,2007 FourthquarterendedJune 30,2007 Revenues $ 629,363 $ 649,270 $ 716,208 $ 736,388 Total costs and operating expenses 475,373 570,911 533,553 561,524 Income from operations 153,990 78,359 182,655 174,864 Net income 135,922 90,049 154,785 147,342 Net income per share: Basic $ 0.68 $ 0.45 $ 0.78 $ 0.77 Diluted $ 0.67 $ 0.44 $ 0.76 $ 0.75 (in thousands, except per share data) First quarter endedSeptember 30,2005 SecondquarterendedDecember 31,2005 ThirdquarterendedMarch 31,2006 FourthquarterendedJune 30,2006 Revenues $ 484,261 $ 487,682 $ 519,648 $ 579,036 Total costs and operating expenses 409,271 412,688 434,721 504,156 Income from operations 74,990 74,994 84,927 74,880 Net income 75,487 76,605 96,684 131,676 Net income per share: Basic $ 0.38 $ 0.39 $ 0.48 $ 0.66 Diluted $ 0.37 $ 0.38 $ 0.47 $ 0.65 Industry Trends As a supplier to the global semiconductor and semiconductor related industries, we are subject to business cycles, the timing, length and volatility of which can be difficult to predict. The industries we serve have historically been cyclical due to sudden changes in demand and manufacturing capacity. We expect that our customers capital spending on process control to increase over the long term. We believe that this increase in process control spending will be driven by the demand for more precise diagnostics capabilities to address multiple new defects as a result of further shrinking of device feature sizes, the transition to new materials, new devices and circuit architecture, new lithography challenges and fab process innovation. We anticipate that these factors will drive increased demand for our products and services over the coming years. The key drivers for growth in the semiconductor equipment industry in calendar year 2007 are the transition to 65nm design nodes, the increased demand for consumer electronics, and the strength of the flash memory market. 36 Table of Contents Revenues and Gross Margin Year ended June 30, (in thousands) 2007 2006 2005 FY07 vs. FY06 FY06 vs. FY05 Revenues: Product $ 2,308,942 $ 1,713,237 $ 1,767,676 $ 595,705 35 % $ (54,439 ) 3 % Service 422,287 357,390 314,202 64,897 18 % 43,188 14 % Total revenues $ 2,731,229 $ 2,070,627 $ 2,081,878 $ 660,602 $ (11,251 ) Costs of revenues $ 1,190,323 $ 942,091 $ 871,000 $ 248,232 26 % $ 71,091 8 % Stock based compensation expense included in costs of revenues $ 29,183 $ 29,620 $ 9,167 $ (437 ) 1 % $ 20,453 223 % Gross margin percentage 56 % 55 % 58 % 1 % 3 % Stock based compensation expense included in costs of revenues as a percentage of total revenues 1 % 1 % 0 % 0 % 1 % Product revenues Product revenues increased in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 primarily as a result of a higher level of orders received due to our customers increased capital spending in the area of process control and yield management. The higher level of customer spending in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 was driven by our customers demand for more precise diagnostics capabilities to address multiple new defects as a result of further shrinking of device feature sizes, the transition to new materials, new devices and circuit architecture, new lithography challenges and fab process innovation. Product revenue was relatively flat in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005. Service revenues Service revenues are generated from maintenance service contracts, as well as time and material billable service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period. Service revenues continued to increase through the three year period disclosed in the table above as our installed base of equipment at our customers sites continued to grow. The amount of service revenues generated is generally a function of the number of post warranty systems installed at our customers sites and the utilization of those systems. Revenues by region Revenues by region for the periods indicated were as follows (in thousands): Year ended June 30, 2007 2006 2005 United States $ 647,813 24 % $ 416,468 20 % $ 494,250 24 % Europe & Israel 271,814 10 % 287,562 14 % 266,048 13 % Japan 600,861 22 % 541,411 26 % 450,240 21 % Taiwan 559,083 20 % 363,014 18 % 429,672 21 % Korea 288,756 11 % 277,316 13 % 148,287 7 % Asia Pacific 362,902 13 % 184,856 9 % 293,381 14 % Total $ 2,731,229 100 % $ 2,070,627 100 % $ 2,081,878 100 % A significant portion of our revenues continues to be generated in Asia, where a substantial portion of the worlds semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located, and we expect that will continue to be the case. 37 Table of Contents Gross margin Our gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product mix, and is affected by variations in costs related to manufacturing and servicing our products. The increase in gross margin during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 was primarily due to increased revenues and savings realized from our cost reduction initiative during the fiscal year. In addition, the following charges were recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007: $33.9 million for additional amortization of intangibles and fair value adjustment for inventory related to the acquisitions completed as of June 30, 2007, of which $13.8 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; $4.9 million for severance and benefits related to an employee workforce reduction, of which $2.3 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; and An aggregate of $4.7 million for reimbursement of taxes to employees, including management, related to IRC Section 409A and cash payment to employees to compensate them for lost benefits resulting from the suspension of the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), which $4.7 million amount was recorded primarily in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. The decrease in gross margin during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 was primarily due to our cessation of development work related to CDSEM and stock based compensation expense recorded during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, which contributed 1% and 1%, respectively, to the decrease in gross margin. During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, we ceased development work on the next generation equipment for CDSEM and incurred charges of $26.5 million resulting from write offs of related inventory and other liabilities related to the cessation of future development of CDSEM. Although we have ceased future development of CDSEM, we will continue to service previously sold equipment. Engineering, Research and Development (R&D) (dollar amounts in thousands) Year ended June 30, 2007 2006 2005 FY07 vs. FY06 FY06 vs. FY05 R&D expenses $ 437,513 $ 393,823 $ 351,984 $ 43,690 11 % $ 41,839 12 % Stock based compensation expense included in R&D expenses $ 42,431 $ 49,509 $ 12,255 $ (7,078 ) 14 % $ 37,254 304 % R&D expenses as a percentage of total revenues 16 % 19 % 17 % 3 % 2 % Stock based compensation expense included in R&D expense as a percentage of total revenues 2 % 2 % 1 % 0 % 1 % The increase in R&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 primarily reflects additional expenses related to the following charges recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007: $17.9 million for in process research and development (IPR&D) charges and amortization of intangibles associated with the acquisitions that we completed as of June 30, 2007, of which $12.3 million was recorded in fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; $10.0 million for impairment of certain patents recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; An aggregate of $5.8 million for reimbursement of taxes to employees, including management, related to IRC Section 409A and cash payments to employees to compensate them for lost benefits resulting from the suspension of the Companys ESPP, which $5.8 million amount was recorded primarily in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; and $4.3 million for severance and benefits related to an employee workforce reduction, of which $2.2 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. 38 Table of Contents The increase in R&D expenses in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 was primarily attributable to increased stock based compensation expenses due to the implementation of SFAS No. 123(R). During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we recorded $16.6 million for in process research and development charges. The fair value of the purchased IPR&D was determined using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows from projects to their net present value. Future cash flows were estimated, taking into account the expected life cycles of the products and the underlying technology, relevant market sizes and industry trends. We determined a discount rate for each project based on the relative risks inherent in the projects development horizon, the estimated costs of development, and the level of technological change in the project and the industry, among other factors. IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been achieved and no future alternative uses existed. The development of these technologies remains a risk due to the remaining efforts to achieve technological feasibility, rapidly changing customer markets, uncertain standards for new products, and significant competitive threats. The nature of the efforts to develop these technologies into commercially viable products consists primarily of planning, designing, experimenting, and testing activities necessary to determine that the technologies can meet market expectations, including functionality and technical requirements. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we determined that we would not pursue future development of certain patents initially licensed during fiscal year 2006 for approximately $14.0 million. Since we did not have any alternative use of these patents and we believe the fair value to be $0, the carrying value of $10.7 million was written off. The write off was recorded as $10.0 million to R&D expense and $0.7 million to cost of revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. R&D expenses include the benefit of $12.7 million, $11.4 million and $7.9 million of external funding received during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, for certain strategic development programs primarily from government grants. We expect our R&D expenses to increase in absolute dollars over the next several years as we accelerate our investments in critical programs focusing on new technologies and enhancements to existing products. Our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace. To do this, we believe that we must continue to make substantial investments in our research and development. We remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the yield challenges our customers face at future technology nodes. Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) (dollar amounts in thousands) Year ended June 30, 2007 2006 2005 FY07 vs. FY06 FY06 vs. FY05 SG&A expenses $ 513,525 $ 424,922 $ 313,774 $ 88,603 21 % $ 111,148 35 % Stock based compensation expense included in SG&A expenses $ 37,164 $ 85,613 $ 15,580 $ (48,449 ) 57 % $ 70,033 450 % SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues 19 % 21 % 15 % 2 % 6 % Stock based compensation expense included in SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues 1 % 4 % 1 % 3 % 3 % 39 Table of Contents The increase in SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 primarily reflects additional charges recorded in SG&A as follows: $56.8 million for impairment charges related to the write down of buildings which was recorded in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; $11.3 million for severance and related benefits related to an employee workforce reduction, of which $6.1 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; $12.3 million for additional amortization of intangibles related to the acquisitions that we completed as of June 30, 2007, of which $1.7 million is recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; $15.8 million for legal and other expenses related to the stock options investigation, shareholder litigation and related matters which was primarily recorded in the first three quarters of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; and $8.0 million for reimbursement of taxes to employees, including management, related to IRC Section 409A and cash payments to employees to compensate them for lost benefits from the suspension of the Companys ESPP, which $8.0 million amount was recorded primarily in the second and third quarters of fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. The cumulative increase in SG&A expenses in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 was offset in part by a decrease in stock based compensation expense primarily due to a reversal of $20.3 million in stock based compensation expense related to our former Chief Executive Officer. In addition, certain options granted in prior years were fully vested in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 resulting in lower levels of stock based compensation expense In November 2006, as part of our long term business plan, we decided to sell certain real estate properties owned by the Company in San Jose, California and Livermore, California. Based on the valuation of these assets, we recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately $56.8 million, which has been included in SG&A during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. See Note 15, Asset Impairment and Severance Charges to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. The increase in SG&A expenses in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 was primarily due to higher levels of stock based compensation expense due to implementation of SFAS No. 123(R) in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 and increased legal costs of $21.1 million attributable to accrued expenses related to the stock option investigation. During November 2005, we announced that effective January 1, 2006, Kenneth L. Schroeder would cease to be our Chief Executive Officer and would thereafter be employed as a Senior Advisor. The Company and Mr. Schroeder also revised his prior agreement with the Company and defined the salary, bonus payout and equity award vesting during the period of his employment as a Senior Advisor. Effective January 1, 2006, we determined that all service conditions associated with certain prior equity awards under the terms of the revised agreement with Mr. Schroeder had been satisfied; accordingly, we recorded at that time an additional non cash, stock based compensation charge of approximately $9.8 million relating to these equity awards. The above mentioned charge is included as a component of SG&A expense during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. On October 16, 2006, following the Special Committee investigation of our historical stock option practices, we terminated all aspects of Mr. Schroeders employment relationship and agreement with the Company. As a result, vesting of Mr. Schroeders then outstanding stock options and restricted stock awards immediately ceased, and the 0.9 million unvested option shares and 0.1 million unvested restricted stock award shares held by Mr. Schroeder at the time of termination were canceled. Accordingly, in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 we reversed approximately $20.3 million of the non cash, stock based compensation charge recorded in prior periods. In December 2006, we canceled 0.6 million vested option shares held by Mr. Schroeder as of the time of termination, representing those shares that had been retroactively priced or otherwise improperly granted. 40 Table of Contents Interest Income and Other, Net Year ended June 30, (dollar amounts in thousands) 2007 2006 2005 Interest income and other, net $ 87,367 $ 68,067 $ 37,956 Percentage of total revenues 3 % 3 % 2 % Interest income and other, net is comprised primarily of interest income earned on our investment and cash portfolio, realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities, as well as income recognized upon settlement of certain foreign currency contracts. The increases in interest income and other, net, in each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, as compared to the prior fiscal year were primarily due to higher short term interest rates. In addition, in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we had an equity interest in a development stage company which we consolidated as of March 31, 2004. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we acquired the remaining minority interest in this entity and subsequently sold certain assets of this entity and recorded a gain of $3.9 million. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 22.2%, 0.4% and 24.3% in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In general, our effective income tax rate is a function of benefits realized from our Extraterritorial Income (ETI) exclusion, foreign earnings taxed at different rates, research and development tax credits and tax exempt interest. In the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2006, the Company reduced its total income tax reserves by $15.3 million and $79.7 million respectively. This was primarily due to expiring statutes of limitations, several tax settlements reached with various tax authorities and reassessments of tax exposures based on the status of current audits in various jurisdictions. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, we entered into a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service related to an examination for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2003 and 2004. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we entered into a settlement with the California Franchise Tax Board related to an examination for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1997, 1998 and 1999. Our benefits for income tax related to equity awards were $34.5 million, $58.2 million and $12.1 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre tax income, non tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions, amounts of tax exempt interest income and research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pre tax income, and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. The statute of limitations has expired for franchise taxes in California, the state in which the Companys headquarters are located, through the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002, and the Internal Revenue Service completed an audit of the Companys corporate tax returns for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2003 and 2004 during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. Liabilities for anticipated worldwide tax audit issues have been established based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional tax payments are probable. The Company believes that adequate reserves have been provided to cover any potential additional tax assessments. Equity Incentive Program Our equity incentive program is a broad based, long term retention program that is intended to attract and retain key employees, and align stockholder and employee interests. The equity incentive program consists of two plans: one under which non employee directors may be granted options to purchase shares of our stock, and another in which non employee directors, officers, key employees, consultants and all other employees may be 41 Table of Contents granted options to purchase shares of our stock, restricted stock units and other types of equity awards. For the past several years until June 30, 2006, stock options (except for the retroactively priced options which were granted primarily prior to fiscal year 2002) were generally granted at the market price of our common stock on the date of grant, with a vesting period of five years and an exercise period not to exceed seven years (ten years for options granted prior to July 1, 2005) from the date of issuance. Restricted stock units may be granted with varying criteria such as time based or performance based vesting. Substantially all of our employees that meet established performance goals and qualify as key employees participate in our main equity incentive plan. Since July 1, 2006, we have granted only restricted stock units under our equity incentive program, except for options granted to non employee directors as part of their regular compensation package for service through June 30, 2007. On October 18, 2004, our stockholders approved the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2004 Plan) which provides for the grant of options to purchase shares of our common stock, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance shares, performance units and deferred stock units to our employees, consultants and members of our Board of Directors. Since the adoption of the 2004 Plan, no further grants are permitted under the 1982 Stock Option Plan or 2000 Non Statutory Stock Option Plan. The 2004 Plan permits the issuance of up to 12.5 million shares of common stock, of which 3.3 million shares were available for grant as of June 30, 2007. Any 2004 Plan awards of restricted stock, performance shares, performance units or deferred stock units with a per share or unit purchase price lower than 100% of fair market value on the grant date shall be counted against the total number of shares issuable under the 2004 Plan as 1.8 shares for every one share subject thereto. Total options and restricted stock units outstanding under all plans as of June 30, 2007 were 19.6 million and 3.4 million, respectively. Stock Based Compensation Expense Effective July 1, 2005, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. SFAS No. 123(R) establishes accounting for stock based awards exchanged for employee services. Accordingly, stock based compensation cost is measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the award which is computed using a Black Scholes option valuation model, and is recognized as expense over the employees requisite service period. The following table shows stock based compensation expense by type of award for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005: Year ended June 30, (in thousands ) 2007 2006 2005 Stock based compensation expense by type of award: Employee stock options $ 82,440 $ 140,447 $ 34,902 Employee stock purchase plan 11,964 16,188 Restricted stock units 14,374 8,107 2,139 Total stock based compensation $ 108,778 $ 164,742 $ 37,041 The decrease in stock based compensation expense in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 was primarily due to a reversal of $20.3 million in stock based compensation expense related to the cancellation of options and restricted stock units previously held by our former Chief Executive Officer. In addition, certain options granted in prior years were fully vested in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 resulting in lower levels of stock based compensation expense. These decreases were offset by $9.3 million of cash compensation related to bonuses payable to the holders of amended options to compensate them for the increase in their option exercise price. The increase in stock based compensation expense in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 is primarily due to the implementation of SFAS No. 123(R). As of June 30, 2007, the unrecognized stock based compensation balance related to stock options was $106.0 million and will be recognized over an estimated weighted average amortization period of 2.6 years. As of June 30, 2007, the unrecognized stock based compensation balance related to restricted stock units was $71.2 million and will be recognized over an estimated weighted average amortization period of 3.2 years. 42 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources As of June 30, (dollar amounts in thousands) 2007 2006 2005 Cash and cash equivalents $ 722,511 $ 1,129,191 $ 663,163 Short term marketable securities 988,118 1,196,605 1,532,023 Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 1,710,629 $ 2,325,796 $ 2,195,186 Percentage of total assets 37 % 51 % 54 % Year ended June 30, (in thousands) 2007 2006 2005 Cash provided by operating activities $ 610,686 $ 315,169 $ 506,735 Cash (used in) provided by investing activities (399,268 ) 225,070 (124,598 ) Cash used in financing activities (633,227 ) (84,959 ) (81,069 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 15,129 10,748 8,213 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (406,680 ) $ 466,028 $ 309,281 We have historically financed our operations through cash generated from operations. Cash provided by operating activities in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 consisted primarily of net income of $528.1 million increased by non cash depreciation and amortization of $109.3 million, stock based compensation of $99.6 million and non cash impairment charges of $67.6 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $107.3 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $45.6 million, a decrease in deferred system profit of $24.4 million and increase in other assets of $19.4 million. Cash provided by operating activities in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 consisted primarily of net income of $380.5 million increased by non cash depreciation and amortization of $69.4 million, stock based compensation of $164.7 million, tax benefit from equity awards of $31.9 million and an increase in accounts payable of $27.1 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $114.9 million, an increase in inventories of $87.7 million, and an increase in net deferred income tax assets of $134.4 million. Cash provided by operating activities in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 consisted primarily of net income of $445.0 million increased by non cash depreciation and amortization of $70.2 million, stock based compensation of $37.0 million, decrease in accounts receivable of $36.6 million and decrease in other assets and liabilities of $42.8 million partially offset by a decrease in deferred system profit of $70.8 million and an increase in net deferred income tax assets of $53.5 million. Investing activities typically consist of purchases and sales or maturities of marketable securities, purchases of capital assets to support long term growth and acquisitions of technology or other companies to allow access to new markets or emerging technologies. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we paid $521.7 million for acquisitions completed during the fiscal year including the acquisition of certain assets of a development stage company. Also, purchases of capital assets in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 includes purchases of $29.9 million related to our Singapore facility. Financing activities include dividend payments to our common stockholders and sales and repurchases of our common stock. Issuance of common stock provided $263.2 million, $212.7 million and $133.6 million in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We used $808.5 million, $221.4 million and $203.7 million in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, to repurchase shares of our common stock. The stock repurchase program was suspended in May 2006 and resumed in February 2007. The increase from fiscal year 2006 to 2007 was primarily due to the Accelerated Share Repurchase (ASR) program described below. This increase in our share repurchases is the primary reason for the decrease in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of June 30, 2007 versus June 30, 2006. 43 Table of Contents During the third quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, our Board of Directors also approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend and declared a dividend of $0.12 per share of our outstanding common stock. The total amount of dividends paid during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $95.1 million, $95.4 million and $23.6 million, respectively. Further, a dividend of $0.15 per share of our outstanding common stock for the first quarter of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2008 was declared in August, 2007 and will be paid on September 1, 2007 to our stockholders on record as of August 20, 2007. In February 2007, we entered into an ASR program with a third party investment bank and prepaid $750.0 million to repurchase its common stock. The purchase price per share of the common stock repurchased through the ASR was determined and adjusted based on a discount to the volume weighted average price of our common stock during a period following the execution of the ASR agreement, subject to a maximum price per share. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 we repurchased 14.0 million shares of our common stock under the ASR, of which 2.0 million shares were delivered to us in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. The shares repurchased under the ASR decreased our basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This decrease was partially offset by additional shares issued upon the exercise of employee stock options and in connection with stock purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Following the conclusion of the fiscal year covered by this report, in August 2007, the Board of Directors authorized KLA Tencor to repurchase up to an additional 10.0 million shares of its common stock under the repurchase program. The following is a schedule summarizing our significant obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of June 30, 2007: (in thousands) Total 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Purchase commitments $ 145,548 $ 143,574 $ 1,974 $ $ $ $ Operating leases 38,218 10,364 7,956 5,400 3,913 2,308 8,277 Pension obligations 10,387 864 924 976 1,001 902 5,720 Other obligations 20,640 20,640 Total contractual cash obligations $ 214,793 $ 175,442 $ 10,854 $ 6,376 $ 4,914 $ 3,210 $ 13,997 We have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse. In addition, from time to time we will discount, without recourse, Letters of Credit (LCs) received from customers in payment for goods. The following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of LCs and related discounting fees paid during the years ended June 30, 2007 and 2006: Year ended June 30, (in thousands) 2007 2006 2005 Receivables sold under factoring agreements $ 278,560 $ 277,960 $ 306,175 Proceeds from sales of LCs $ 61,850 $ 69,286 $ 29,602 Discounting fees paid on sales of LCs(1) $ 804 $ 788 $ 195 (1) Discounting fees were equivalent to interest expense and were recorded in interest and other income net. We maintain guarantee arrangements of $27.9 million in various locations to fund customs guarantee for VAT and LC needs of its subsidiaries in Europe and Asia. Approximately $18.4 million was outstanding under these arrangements as of June 30, 2007. We maintain certain purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply chain for key components. Our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted 44 Table of Contents time horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecast time horizon can vary among different suppliers. We estimate our purchase commitment as of June 30, 2007 to be approximately $145.5 million which are primarily due within the next 12 months. Actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may change in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. Certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties. We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. The actual product performance and or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty reserves accordingly. The difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited or no historical product performance to estimate warranty expense; more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates. Non standard warranty coverage generally includes services incremental to the standard 40 hour per week coverage for twelve months. See Note 11 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Because virtually all holders of retroactively priced options issued by the Company were not involved in or aware of the retroactive pricing, the Company has taken certain actions to deal with the adverse tax consequences that may be incurred by the holders of retroactively priced options. The adverse tax consequences are that retroactively priced stock options vesting after December 31, 2004 (409A Affected Options) subject the option holder to a penalty tax under IRC Section 409A (and, as applicable, similar penalty taxes under California and other state tax laws). One such action by the Company involved offering to amend the 409A Affected Options to increase the exercise price to the market price on the actual grant date or, if lower, the market price at the time of the amendment. The amended options are not subject to taxation under IRC Section 409A. Under IRS regulations, these option amendments had to be completed by December 31, 2006 for anyone who was an executive officer when he or she received 409A Affected Options; the amendments for non officers do not need to be completed until December 31, 2007. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we accrued approximately $20.2 million payable to non executive holders of the amended options to compensate them for the resulting increase in their option exercise prices. The $20.2 million is payable in January 2008. Of the $20.2 million, $9.3 million was recorded as stock based compensation expense, and the remaining $10.9 million was recorded in common stock and capital in excess of par value in the balance sheet. The amount of these bonuses will effectively repaid to the Company if and when the options are exercised and the increased exercise price is paid. However, there is no assurance that the options will be exercised and the employees will retain the bonuses under all circumstances. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we also recorded approximately $13.9 million to compensate certain option holders whose employment had terminated, or who had already exercised 409A Affected Options, for the additional taxes they incurred under IRC Section 409A (and, as applicable, similar state tax laws). Three of the Companys option holders were subject to the December 31, 2006 deadline described above. Accordingly, in December 2006, the Company offered to amend the 409A Affected Options held by Mr. Wallace, the Companys Chief Executive Officer, and two former executive officers to increase the exercise price so that these options will not subject the option holder to a penalty tax under IRC Section 409A. All three individuals accepted the Companys offer. In addition, the Company agreed to pay each of the three individuals a cash bonus in January 2008 equal to the aggregate increase in the exercise prices for his amended options. For Mr. Wallace, the amount of this bonus is $0.4 million. To account for these actions, the Company has recorded a charge of $0.3 million, net of amount reclassified from capital in excess of par, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. We are involved in several litigation cases as described in Note 12, Litigation and Other Legal Matters to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We cannot predict the outcome of these cases, and we cannot estimate the likelihood or potential dollar amount of any adverse results. 45 Table of Contents Working capital decreased to $2,179.6 million as of June 30, 2007, compared to $2,594.5 million as of June 30, 2006. This decrease is primarily due to cash payments for the ASR program and acquisitions in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. As of June 30, 2007, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $1,710.6 million of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business, and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Under our foreign currency risk management strategy, we utilize derivative instruments to protect our interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates. This financial exposure is monitored and managed as an integral part of our overall risk management program which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. We continue our policy of hedging our current and forecasted foreign currency exposures with hedging instruments having tenors of up to 18 months. The outstanding hedge contracts, with maximum maturity of 13 months, were as follows: As of June 30, (in thousands) 2007 2006 Cash flow hedge contracts Purchase $ 4,651 $ 15,173 Sell (242,942 ) (167,525 ) Other foreign currency hedge contracts Purchase 126,992 128,406 Sell (265,378 ) (260,165 ) Net $ (376,677 ) $ (284,111 ) 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. To mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency hedges. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of June 30, 2007. Actual results may differ materially. As of June 30, 2007, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of $988.1 million, excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents (detail of these securities is included in Note 3, Marketable Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements found under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report on Form 10 K). These securities, as with all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10% from levels as of June 30, 2007, the fair value of the portfolio would decline by $5.1 million. As of June 30, 2007, we had net forward contracts to sell $376.7 million in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures (detail of these contracts and hedging activities is included in Note 13, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities to the Consolidated Financial Statements). If we had entered into these contracts on June 30, 2007, the U.S. dollar equivalent would have been $365.0 million. A 10% adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by $50.3 million. However, if this occurred, the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount. Accordingly, we believe that, as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure, changes in most relevant foreign currency exchange rates should have no material impact on income or cash flows. 47 Table of Contents
