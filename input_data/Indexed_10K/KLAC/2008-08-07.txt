ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. This discussion contains forward looking statements, which involve risk and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. (See Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements.) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We based these estimates and assumptions on historical experience, and evaluate them on an on going basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the Companys related disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows: Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the sellers price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. We derive revenue from three sources system sales, spare part sales and service contracts. We typically recognize revenue for system sales upon acceptance by the customer that the system has been installed and is operating according to predetermined specifications. We also recognize revenue prior to written acceptance from the customer, as follows: When system sales to independent distributors have no installation requirement, contain no acceptance agreement, and 100% payment is due upon shipment, revenue is recognized upon shipment; When the installation of the system is deemed perfunctory, revenue is recognized upon shipment. The portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation; When the customer fab has already accepted the same tool, with the same specifications, and it can be objectively demonstrated that the tool meets all of the required acceptance criteria upon shipment, revenue is recognized upon shipment. The portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation; When the customer withholds signature on our acceptance document due to issues unrelated to product performance, revenue is recognized when the system is performing as intended and meets all published and contractually agreed specifications; When the system is damaged during transit and title has passed to the customer, revenue is recognized upon receipt of cash payment from the customer. Total revenue recognized without a written acceptance from the customer was approximately 16%, 14% and 4% of total revenues for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in revenue recognized without a written acceptance is primarily driven by increased shipments of tools that have already met the required acceptance criteria at those customer fabs as well as an increase in sales of systems with perfunctory installation, primarily with respect to sales of products of companies that we have acquired during the past two fiscal years. Shipping charges billed to customers are included in system revenue, and the related shipping costs are included in costs of revenues. 29 Trade in rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection with subsequent purchases. We estimate the value of the trade in right and reduce the revenue of the initial sale. This amount is recognized at the earlier of the exercise of the trade in right or the expiration of the trade in right. Spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped, risk of loss has passed to the customer, and collection of the resulting receivable is probable. Service and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract. Consulting and training revenue is recognized when the related services are performed. The deferred system profit balance equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment less applicable product and warranty costs. We also defer the fair value of non standard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue. Non standard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40 hour per week coverage for twelve months. Non standard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences. Software is incidental to our products as determined in accordance with AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition and Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03 05, Applicability of SOP 97 2 to Non Software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing More Than Incidental Software. We periodically review the software element of our systems in accordance with SOP No. 97 2 and EITF Issue No. 03 05. Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first in, first out basis) or market. Demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost, and reserves are recorded to state the demonstration units at their net realizable value. We review the adequacy of our inventory reserves on a quarterly basis. We review and set standard costs semi annually at current manufacturing costs in order to approximate actual costs. Our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage) are recognized as current period charges. We write down inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence. These factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand, and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values. Warranty. We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. Utilizing actual service records, we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the actual labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge. We update these estimated charges on a quarterly basis. The actual product performance and or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty reserves accordingly. The difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited historical product performance to estimate warranty expense; more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates. See Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. A majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world. In order to monitor potential credit losses, we 30 perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of all accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance. We take into consideration (1) any circumstances of which we are aware of a customers inability to meet its financial obligations; and (2) our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers. If circumstances change, and the financial condition of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us, we may need to take additional allowances, which would result in a reduction of our net income. Stock Based Compensation. Effective July 1, 2005, we adopted the modified prospective transition method as provided by provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. SFAS No. 123(R) establishes accounting for stock based awards exchanged for employee services. Accordingly, the fair value of stock based awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the employees requisite service period. The fair value is determined using a Black Scholes valuation model for stock options and for purchase rights under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date for restricted stock units. The Black Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the options expected life and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock. The expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the market based implied volatility from traded options of our common stock. We believe that the implied volatility is reflective of market conditions. Prior to July 1, 2005, we applied Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and its related Interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. Contingencies and Litigation. We are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated settlement costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. As required by SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment tests annually, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair value based approach. Purchased technology, patents, trademarks and other intangible assets are presented at cost, net of accumulated amortization. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis which approximates their estimated useful lives and assessed for impairment under SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. See Note 5, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination. We completed our annual evaluation of goodwill by reporting unit during the quarter ended December 31, 2007, which evaluation indicated that there was no such impairment. There have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to the impairment test performed in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We have determined that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover all of our deferred tax assets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we could be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not probable. 31 On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. We carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed within the interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. We adopted FIN 48 on July 1, 2007. See Note 11, Income Taxes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Valuation of Marketable Securities. Our investments in available for sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, as reported on our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity. However, changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the securitys cost basis. We periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other than temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment, and our ability and intent to hold the investment until the earlier of market price recovery or maturity. Our assessment that an investment is not other than temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumption related to any particular investment. 32 Effects of Recent Accounting Pronouncements. In May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. This statement identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States. We do not expect that this Statement will result in a change in any of our current accounting practices. In April 2008, the FASB adopted FASB Staff Position SFAS No. 142 3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets, amending the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. This FASB Staff Position is effective for intangible assets acquired on or after July 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact of the implementation of FASB Staff Position SFAS No. 142 3 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of SFAS No. 133. This statement changes the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities. SFAS No. 161 will require us to provide enhanced disclosures about (a) how and why we use derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133 and its related interpretations, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect our financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 is effective for our interim period beginning January 1, 2009. The adoption of SFAS No. 161 is not expected to have an effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In February 2008, the FASB adopted FASB Staff Position SFAS No. 157 2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, delaying the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for one year for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). We are currently evaluating the impact of the implementation of SFAS No. 157 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (Revised 2007), Business Combinations. SFAS No. 141(R) retains the fundamental requirements of the original pronouncement requiring that the purchase method be used for all business combinations. SFAS No. 141(R) defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination, establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves control and requires the acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest at their fair values as of the acquisition date. In addition, SFAS No. 141(R) requires expensing of acquisition related and restructure related costs, remeasurement of earn out provisions at fair value, measurement of equity securities issued for purchase at the date of close of the transaction and non expensing of in process research and development related intangibles. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for our business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after July 1, 2009, except that resolution of certain tax contingencies and adjustments to valuation allowances related to business combinations, which previously were adjusted to goodwill, will be adjusted to income tax expense for all such adjustments after July 1, 2009, regardless of the date of the original business combination. We are currently evaluating the impact of the implementation of SFAS No. 141(R) on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51. This Statement amends ARB 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. It requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest. This Statement establishes a single method of accounting for changes in a parents ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation. SFAS No. 160 is effective for our fiscal year beginning July 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact of the implementation of SFAS No. 160 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 33 In June 2007, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 07 3, Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or Services to Be Used in Future Research and Development Activities. This issue provides that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized. Such amounts should be recognized as an expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed. EITF Issue No. 07 3 is effective for our fiscal year beginning July 1, 2008. The adoption of EITF Issue No. 07 3 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115, which is effective for our fiscal year beginning July 1, 2008. This statement permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates. Subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be reported in earnings. The adoption of SFAS No. 159 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 are effective for our fiscal year beginning July 1, 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of the implementation of SFAS No. 157 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 34 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY KLA Tencor Corporation is the worlds leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related microelectronics industries. Within our primary area of focus, our comprehensive portfolio of products, services, software and expertise helps integrated circuit (IC or chip) manufacturers manage yield throughout the entire fabrication process from research and development to final volume production. Our products are also used in a number of other industries, including light emitting diode, data storage, and solar cell and wafer production. Our products and services are used by the vast majority of wafer, IC, disk and reticle manufacturers in the world. Our revenues are driven largely by capital spending by our customers that operate in one or more of several key markets, including the memory, foundry and logic markets. Over the past few years, customers in the memory market have made significant increases in capital spending and, as a consequence, contributed an increased share of our revenues. These customers, however, have been adversely impacted by a challenging pricing environment in fiscal 2008 for their products, and consequently have scaled back their investments in new production capacity. Our customers purchase our products to either ramp up production in response to the need to drive advances in process technologies or to satisfy demand from industries such as communication, data processing, consumer electronics, automotive, and aerospace. Our customers today are investing in advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules and higher density applications, as well as reduced cost, which in turn are driving increased adoption of process control to reduce defectivity. While demand from various industries continues to steadily rise, the demand for our products is affected by profitability of our customers which is driven by capacity and market supply for their products as well as the global macroeconomic environment. Our revenues have declined sequentially over the past four quarters and reflect slowing worldwide demand for semiconductor equipment. Industry analysts expect demand for capital equipment to decline in calendar year 2008 compared to calendar year 2007. Such a decline would affect our revenue levels in future quarters. While capacity driven purchases by our customers are adversely impacted in environments such as the one we are currently in, the demand for technology driven purchases are less susceptible to business cycles. As a supplier to the global semiconductor and semiconductor related industries, we are subject to business cycles, the timing, length and volatility of which can be difficult to predict. The industries we serve have historically been cyclical due to sudden changes in demand and manufacturing capacity. We expect our customers capital spending on process control to constitute a higher portion of their capital spending over time. We believe that this increase in process control spending will be driven by the demand for more precise diagnostics capabilities to address multiple new defects as a result of further shrinking of device feature sizes, the transition to new materials, new devices and circuit architecture, new lithography challenges and fab process innovation. We anticipate that these factors will drive increased demand for our products and services such as ours over the coming years. The key drivers in the semiconductor equipment industry today are the competitive pressures for our customers to improve yields, lower their costs and get products to market more quickly in order to benefit from the increased demand for products from the consumer electronics, computing and communication industries. We continuously evaluate strategic acquisitions and alliances to expand our technologies, product offerings and distribution capabilities. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, KLA Tencor completed a number of acquisitions including ADE Corporation, OnWafer Technologies, Inc., SensArray Corporation, Japan ADE, Ltd, and Therma Wave, Inc. Most recently, in June 2008, we completed the acquisition of ICOS Vision Systems Corporation NV primarily to expand our product portfolio in semiconductor packaging inspection and to gain entry into the solar cell inspection and light emitting diode (LED) wafer inspection markets. ICOS is a leading supplier of packaging and interconnect inspection solutions for the back end markets in semiconductor industry, and also has a market leadership position in the inspection of photovoltaic solar technologies and LED wafers. The results of operations of ICOS are included in the following table from the date of the acquisition of majority control on May 30, 2008. 35 The following table sets forth some of our key quarterly unaudited financial information: (in thousands, except per share data) FirstquarterendedSeptember 30,2007 SecondquarterendedDecember 31,2007 ThirdquarterendedMarch 31,2008 FourthquarterendedJune 30,2008 Total revenues $ 693,020 $ 635,783 $ 602,219 $ 590,694 Total costs and operating expenses 515,742 542,296 477,019 487,283 Income from operations 177,278 93,487 125,200 103,411 Net income 88,158 83,935 110,980 76,010 Net income per share: Basic $ 0.47 $ 0.46 $ 0.62 $ 0.43 Diluted $ 0.46 $ 0.45 $ 0.61 $ 0.43 (in thousands, except per share data) FirstquarterendedSeptember 30,2006 SecondquarterendedDecember 31,2006 ThirdquarterendedMarch 31,2007 FourthquarterendedJune 30,2007 Total revenues $ 629,363 $ 649,270 $ 716,208 $ 736,388 Total costs and operating expenses 475,373 570,911 533,553 561,524 Income from operations 153,990 78,359 182,655 174,864 Net income 135,922 90,049 154,785 147,342 Net income per share: Basic $ 0.68 $ 0.45 $ 0.78 $ 0.77 Diluted $ 0.67 $ 0.44 $ 0.76 $ 0.75 Revenues and Gross Margin Year ended June 30, (in thousands) 2008 2007 2006 FY08 vs. FY07 FY07 vs. FY06 Revenues: Product $ 2,030,224 $ 2,308,942 $ 1,713,237 $ (278,718 ) 12 % $ 595,705 35 % Service 491,492 422,287 357,390 69,205 16 % 64,897 18 % Total revenues $ 2,521,716 $ 2,731,229 $ 2,070,627 $ (209,513 ) $ 660,602 Costs of revenues $ 1,145,416 $ 1,190,323 $ 942,091 $ (44,907 ) 4 % $ 248,232 26 % Stock based compensation expense included in costs of revenues $ 22,041 $ 29,183 $ 29,620 $ (7,142 ) 24 % $ (437 ) 1 % Gross margin percentage 55 % 56 % 55 % 1 % 1 % Stock based compensation expense included in costs of revenues as a percentage of total revenues 1 % 1 % 1 % 0 % 0 % Product revenues Product revenues decreased in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 primarily as a result of reduced capital spending by our customers due to ongoing weakness in the semiconductor industry and a deteriorating macroeconomic environment. The decline in revenues reflects slowing worldwide demand for semiconductor equipment, as semiconductor companies reduce capital spending and conserve cash in response to their business environment, even as their need for more precise diagnostics capabilities increases with technological advances. 36 Product revenues increased in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 primarily as a result of a higher level of orders received due to our customers increased capital spending in the area of process control and yield management. The higher level of customer spending in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 was driven by our customers demand for more precise diagnostics capabilities to address multiple new defects as a result of further shrinking of device feature sizes, the transition to new materials, new devices and circuit architecture, new lithography challenges and fab process innovation. For each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006, no customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues. For each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, no customer accounted for more than 10% of net accounts receivable. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, one customer accounted for 13% of net accounts receivable. Service revenues Service revenues are generated from maintenance service contracts, as well as time and material billable service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period. Service revenues continued to increase through the three year period disclosed in the table above as our installed base of equipment at our customers sites continued to grow. The amount of service revenues generated is generally a function of the number of post warranty systems installed at our customers sites and the utilization of those systems. Revenues by region Revenues by region for the periods indicated were as follows (in thousands): Year ended June 30, 2008 2007 2006 United States $ 518,851 21 % $ 647,813 24 % $ 416,468 20 % Europe & Israel 305,350 12 % 271,814 10 % 287,562 14 % Japan 617,214 24 % 600,861 22 % 541,411 26 % Taiwan 570,904 23 % 559,083 20 % 363,014 18 % Korea 225,119 9 % 288,756 11 % 277,316 13 % Asia Pacific 284,278 11 % 362,902 13 % 184,856 9 % Total $ 2,521,716 100 % $ 2,731,229 100 % $ 2,070,627 100 % A significant portion of our revenues continues to be generated in Asia, where a substantial portion of the worlds semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located, and we expect that will continue to be the case. Gross margin Our gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product mix, and is affected by variations in costs related to manufacturing and servicing our products. The decrease in gross margin during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 was primarily due to $21.4 million of inventory write downs related to disposal of service inventory as well as discontinued products in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. In addition, the following charges were recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008: $41.0 million for amortization of intangibles, impairment of intangibles and fair value adjustment for inventory related to the acquisitions, of which $12.8 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008; and $3.2 million for severance and benefits related to an employee workforce reduction. 37 The increase in gross margin during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 was primarily due to increased revenues and savings realized from our cost reduction initiatives during the fiscal year. In addition, the following charges were recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007: $33.9 million for amortization of intangibles and fair value adjustment for inventory related to the acquisitions completed as of June 30, 2007, of which $13.8 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; $4.9 million for severance and benefits related to an employee workforce reduction, of which $2.3 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; and An aggregate of $4.7 million for reimbursement of taxes to employees, including management, related to IRC Section 409A and cash payment to employees to compensate them for lost benefits resulting from the suspension of the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), which $4.7 million amount was recorded primarily in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. Engineering, Research and Development (R&D) (dollar amounts in thousands) Year ended June 30, 2008 2007 2006 FY08 vs. FY07 FY07 vs. FY06 R&D expenses $ 409,973 $ 437,513 $ 393,823 $ (27,540 ) 6 % $ 43,690 11 % Stock based compensation expense included in R&D expenses $ 32,623 $ 42,431 $ 49,509 $ (9,808 ) 23 % $ (7,078 ) 14 % R&D expenses as a percentage of total revenues 16 % 16 % 19 % 0 % 3 % Stock based compensation expense included in R&D expense as a percentage of total revenues 1 % 2 % 2 % 1 % 0 % The decrease in R&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 is primarily attributable to the absence of any impairment charges and lower stock based compensation expense due to our transition from granting stock options to our employees to granting restricted stock units, which carry with them lower stock based compensation expense. The following charges were recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008: $22.7 million for in process research and development (IPR&D) charges associated with the acquisitions that we had completed as of June 30, 2008, of which $18.5 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008; $2.1 million for amortization of intangibles related to the acquisitions, of which $0.7 million was recorded in fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008; $1.3 million for severance and benefits related to an employee workforce reduction; and $32.6 million for stock based compensation expense for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to $42.4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. Of the $32.6 million recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, $8.9 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. The increase in R&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 primarily reflects additional expenses related to the following charges recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007: $16.6 million for IPR&D charges associated with the acquisitions that we had completed as of June 30, 2007, of which $12.0 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; 38 $1.3 million for amortization of intangibles related to the acquisitions, of which $0.3 million was recorded in fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; $10.0 million for impairment of certain patents, all of which was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; An aggregate of $5.8 million for reimbursement of taxes to employees, including management, related to IRC Section 409A and cash payments to employees to compensate them for lost benefits resulting from the suspension of the Companys ESPP, which $5.8 million amount was recorded primarily in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; and $4.3 million for severance and benefits related to an employee workforce reduction, of which $2.2 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, we expensed IPR&D of $22.7 million and $16.6 million, respectively, upon the completion of the acquisitions during the fiscal years in connection with acquired intellectual property for which technological feasibility has not been established and no future alternative uses exist. The fair value of the purchased IPR&D was determined using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows from projects to their net present value. Future cash flows were estimated, taking into account the expected life cycles of the products and the underlying technology, relevant market sizes and industry trends. We determined a discount rate for each project based on the relative risks inherent in the projects development horizon, the estimated costs of development, and the level of technological change in the project and the industry, among other factors. IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been achieved and no future alternative uses existed. The development of these technologies remains a risk due to the remaining efforts to achieve technological feasibility, rapidly changing customer markets, uncertain standards for new products, and significant competitive threats. The nature of the efforts to develop these technologies into commercially viable products consists primarily of planning, designing, experimenting, and testing activities necessary to determine that the technologies can meet market expectations, including functionality and technical requirements. As of June 30, 2008, there have been no material changes from the underlying assumptions that were used in the original computation of the value of the acquired IPR&D. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we determined that we would not pursue future development of certain patents initially licensed to us during fiscal year 2006 for approximately $14.0 million. Since we did not have any alternative use for these patents and we believe the fair value to be $0, the carrying value of $10.7 million was written off. The write off was recorded as $10.0 million to R&D expense and $0.7 million to cost of revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. R&D expenses include the benefit of $20.4 million, $12.7 million and $11.4 million of external funding received during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, for certain strategic development programs primarily from government grants. We expect our R&D expenses to increase in absolute dollars over the next several years as we accelerate our investments in critical programs focusing on new technologies and enhancements to existing products. Our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace. To do this, we believe that we must continue to make substantial investments in our research and development. We remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the yield challenges our customers face at future technology nodes. 39 Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) (dollar amounts in thousands) Year ended June 30, 2008 2007 2006 FY08 vs. FY07 FY07 vs. FY06 SG&A expenses $ 466,951 $ 513,525 $ 424,922 $ (46,574 ) 9 % $ 88,603 21 % Stock based compensation expense included in SG&A expenses $ 51,806 $ 37,164 $ 85,613 $ 14,642 39 % $ (48,449 ) 57 % SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues 19 % 19 % 21 % 0 % 2 % Stock based compensation expense included in SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues 2 % 1 % 4 % 1 % 3 % The decrease in SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 is primarily attributable to gains recognized on sale of our certain real estate assets, lower severance and benefits related to employee workforce reduction, lower stock based compensation expense and improvements in our operational efficiency. The following charges and gains were recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008: $20.1 million gain on sale of our real estate assets, of which $2.5 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008; $4.0 million for severance and related benefits related to an employee workforce reduction; $10.4 million for amortization of intangibles related to the acquisitions that we had completed as of June 30, 2008, of which $3.7 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008; $75.9 million charge to cover the $65.0 million settlement plus related litigation expenses for the pending shareholder class action litigation relating to the Companys historical stock option practices, as described in Note 13, Litigation and Other Legal Matters to our Consolidated Financial Statements; and $51.8 million for stock based compensation expense for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to $37.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. Of the $51.8 million recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, $15.0 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. The increase in SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 primarily reflects additional charges recorded in SG&A as follows: $56.8 million for impairment charges related to the write down of buildings, which was recorded in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; $11.3 million for severance and related benefits related to an employee workforce reduction, of which $6.1 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; $12.3 million for amortization of intangibles related to the acquisitions that we had completed as of June 30, 2007, of which $1.7 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; $15.8 million for legal and other expenses related to the stock options investigation, shareholder litigation and related matters, which charges were primarily recorded in the first three quarters of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; and $8.0 million for reimbursement of taxes to employees, including management, related to IRC Section 409A and cash payments to employees to compensate them for lost benefits from the suspension of the Companys ESPP, which $8.0 million amount was recorded primarily in the second and third quarters of fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. The cumulative increase in SG&A expenses in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 was partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense. The decrease 40 in stock based compensation expense was primarily attributable to a reversal of $20.3 million in stock based compensation expense related to the termination of employment of the Companys former Chief Executive Officer. The year over year decrease in stock based compensation expense was also partially caused by the completion of vesting during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 of certain options granted in prior years, as well as our transition from granting stock options to our employees to granting restricted stock units, which carry with them lower stock based compensation expense. In November 2006, as part of our long term business plan, we decided to sell certain real estate properties owned by the Company in San Jose, California and Livermore, California. Based on the valuation of these assets, we recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately $56.8 million, which has been included in SG&A during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. See Note 16, Sale and Impairment of Real Estate Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. During November 2005, we announced that effective January 1, 2006, Kenneth L. Schroeder would cease to be our Chief Executive Officer and would thereafter be employed as a Senior Advisor. The Company and Mr. Schroeder also revised his prior agreement with the Company and defined the salary, bonus payout and equity award vesting during the period of his employment as a Senior Advisor. Effective January 1, 2006, we determined that all service conditions associated with certain prior equity awards under the terms of the revised agreement with Mr. Schroeder had been satisfied; accordingly, we recorded at that time an additional non cash, stock based compensation charge of approximately $9.8 million relating to these equity awards. The above mentioned charge is included as a component of SG&A expense during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. On October 16, 2006, following the Special Committee investigation of our historical stock option practices, we terminated all aspects of Mr. Schroeders employment relationship and agreement with the Company. As a result, vesting of Mr. Schroeders then outstanding stock options and restricted stock awards immediately ceased, and the 0.9 million unvested option shares and 0.1 million unvested restricted stock award shares held by Mr. Schroeder at the time of termination were canceled. Accordingly, in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, the Company reversed $20.3 million of the non cash, stock based compensation charges in accordance with paragraphs 19 and 43 of SFAS No. 123(R), because Mr. Schroeder would no longer be able to fulfill his service obligations. The $20.3 million reversal related to the charges that had been recorded in prior periods related to unvested option shares and restricted stock award shares. In December 2006, the Company canceled 0.6 million vested option shares held by Mr. Schroeder as of the time of termination, representing those shares that had been retroactively priced or otherwise improperly granted. In accordance with paragraph 57 of SFAS No. 123(R), previously recognized stock based compensation expense related to these awards was not reversed upon cancellation. Interest Income and Other, Net Year ended June 30, (dollar amounts in thousands) 2008 2007 2006 Interest income and other, net $ 71,625 $ 90,148 $ 70,242 Interest expense $ 10,767 $ 2,781 $ 2,175 Interest income and other, net as a percentage of total revenues 3 % 3 % 3 % Interest expense as a percentage of total revenues 0 % 0 % 0 % Interest income and other, net is comprised primarily of interest income earned on our investment and cash portfolio, realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities, as well as income recognized upon settlement of certain foreign currency contracts. The decrease in interest income and other, net in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 is primarily due to the lower interest income earned on lower average cash balance during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. The increase in interest expense in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 is primarily due to additional interest expense as a result of the issuance of 41 $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. The increase in interest income and other, net in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 was primarily due to higher short term interest rates. In addition, in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we had an equity interest in a development stage company which we have been consolidating since March 31, 2004. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we acquired the remaining minority interest in this entity and subsequently sold certain assets of this entity and recorded a gain of $3.9 million. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 35.9%, 22.2% and 0.4% in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In general, our effective income tax rate is a function of benefits realized from our Extraterritorial Income (ETI) exclusion, domestic manufacturing deduction (DMD), foreign earnings taxed at different rates, research and development tax credits and tax exempt interest. In addition, our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 included $52.9 million of incremental U.S. tax expense associated with the implementation of our global manufacturing strategy. The incremental U.S. tax expense was a result of an inter company licensing agreement related to the migration of manufacturing to Singapore. That increase in our U.S. tax expense was partially offset by a benefit of $14.4 million that we recognized during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 resulting from revising the amount of prior year cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries considered to be permanently reinvested outside the United States. Our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 included a reduction in tax expense of $15.3 million resulting from the reduction in tax reserves primarily due to the resolution of an examination by the State of California for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1997 to June 30, 1999, receipt by the Company of a federal tax refund for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001, and the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxations confirmation of the Internal Revenue Services audit findings related to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003. Our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 included a reduction in tax expense of $79.7 million resulting from the reduction in tax reserves primarily due to the resolution of a federal income tax examination of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2003 and June 30, 2004, and the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to federal taxes for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2001 and June 30, 2002. We adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), on July 1, 2007. As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, we increased the liability for net unrecognized tax benefits by $8.4 million, and accounted for the increase as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle that resulted in a reduction of retained earnings of $8.4 million at July 1, 2007. We have historically classified accruals for tax uncertainties in current taxes payable. Upon adoption of FIN 48, we have reclassified taxes payable of $62.1 million from current to non current liability. As of the adoption date of FIN 48, we had gross tax effected unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $77.2 million, of which $72.5 million, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate, while the remaining $4.7 million would reduce acquisition related goodwill. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2008, unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $12.5 million, related to various tax positions including the filing of an amended Federal income tax return for the year ended June 30, 2005. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within interest income and other, net. As of the adoption date of FIN 48, we had accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $12.9 million. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2008, interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $4.0 million as a result of the decrease in unrecognized tax benefits for the year. We conduct business globally and, as a result, we and one or more of our subsidiaries file income tax returns in various jurisdictions throughout the world, including with the United States federal government, various U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. The Company is not under federal income tax examination at this time. We 42 remain subject to federal income tax examination for all years from the year ended June 30, 2005. We are subject to state income tax examinations for all years from the year ended June 30, 2003. We are also subject to examinations in major foreign jurisdictions, including Japan, Israel and Singapore, for all years from the year ended June 30, 2003 and are currently under tax examinations in various foreign tax jurisdictions. Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre tax income, non tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions, amounts of tax exempt interest income and research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pre tax income, and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of June 30, (dollar amounts in thousands) 2008 2007 2006 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,128,106 $ 722,511 $ 1,129,191 Marketable securities 451,277 988,118 1,196,605 Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 1,579,383 $ 1,710,629 $ 2,325,796 Percentage of total assets 33 % 37 % 51 % Year ended June 30, (in thousands) 2008 2007 2006 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 668,175 $ 610,686 $ 315,169 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 52,499 (399,268 ) 225,070 Net cash used in financing activities (318,938 ) (633,227 ) (84,959 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 3,859 15,129 10,748 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 405,595 $ (406,680 ) $ 466,028 At June 30, 2008, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.6 billion, a decrease of $131.2 million from June 30, 2007. We generated $668.2 million in cash from operations and an additional $52.5 million from our investing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. We used $318.9 million in cash for financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. We used $1.1 billion for the repurchase of common stock under our share repurchase program, and we raised $744.6 million from the issuance of long term debt. We have historically financed our operations through cash generated from operations. Cash provided by operating activities was $668.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. Cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 consisted primarily of net income of $359.1 million, increased by non cash depreciation and amortization of $126.4 million, stock based compensation of $106.5 million, a decrease in inventories of $100.2 million due to lower build plan as a result of lower bookings, and a decrease in accounts receivable of $149.3 million as collections exceeded shipments during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. These increases in operating cash flow were partially offset by changes in other assets and liabilities of $178.2 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. Cash provided by operating activities in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 consisted primarily of net income of $528.1 million increased by non cash depreciation and amortization of $109.3 million, stock based compensation of $99.6 million and non cash impairment charges of $67.6 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $107.3 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $45.6 million, a decrease in deferred system profit of $24.4 million and increase in other assets of $19.4 million. Cash provided by operating activities in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 consisted primarily of net income of $380.5 million increased by non cash depreciation and amortization of $69.4 million, stock based compensation of $164.7 million, tax benefit from equity awards of $31.9 million and an increase in accounts 43 payable of $27.1 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $114.9 million, an increase in inventories of $87.7 million, and an increase in net deferred income tax assets of $134.4 million. Investing activities typically consist of purchases and sales or maturities of marketable securities, purchases of capital assets to support long term growth and acquisitions of technology or other companies to allow access to new markets or emerging technologies. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, we paid $494.0 million for acquisitions completed during the fiscal year which was primarily for the acquisition of ICOS. Also, sales of certain real estate assets during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 generated $68.8 million. Financing activities include dividend payments to our common stockholders and sales and repurchases of our common stock. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, we generated $744.6 million in cash from the issuance of long term debt, offset by $7.4 million in debt issuance costs. Issuances of common stock provided $155.6 million, $263.2 million and $212.7 million in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We used $1.1 billion, $808.5 million and $221.4 million in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, to repurchase shares of our common stock. The stock repurchase program was suspended in May 2006 and resumed in February 2007. The increase from fiscal year 2006 to 2007 was primarily due to the Accelerated Share Repurchase (ASR) program described below. This increase in our share repurchases is the primary reason for the decrease in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of June 30, 2007 as compared to June 30, 2006. The total amount of dividends paid during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $108.5 million, $95.1 million and $95.4 million, respectively. Further, a dividend of $0.15 per share of our outstanding common stock for the first quarter of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2009 was declared in August 2008 and will be paid on September 2, 2008 to our stockholders on record as of August 18, 2008. In February 2007, we entered into an ASR program with a third party investment bank and prepaid $750.0 million to repurchase our common stock. The purchase price per share of the common stock repurchased through the ASR was determined and adjusted based on a discount to the volume weighted average price of our common stock during a period following the execution of the ASR agreement, subject to a maximum price per share. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 we repurchased 14.0 million shares of our common stock under the ASR, of which 2.0 million shares were delivered to us in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. The shares repurchased under the ASR decreased our basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This decrease was partially offset by additional shares issued upon the exercise of employee stock options and in connection with stock purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The following is a schedule summarizing our significant obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of June 30, 2008: Fiscal year ending June 30, (in thousands) Total 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Other(1) Long term debt obligations(2) $ 750,000 $ $ $ $ $ $ 750,000 Interest expense associated with long term debt obligations 508,875 51,750 51,750 51,750 51,750 51,750 250,125 Purchase commitments 124,348 123,127 1,221 Litigation settlement 64,750 64,750 Non current income tax payable 63,634 63,634 Operating leases 37,632 11,337 8,185 5,630 2,573 1,853 8,054 Pension obligations 12,322 1,087 1,190 1,239 1,064 1,110 6,632 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,561,561 $ 252,051 $ 62,346 $ 58,619 $ 55,387 $ 54,713 $ 1,014,811 $ 63,634 (1) Represents the non current tax payable obligation under FIN 48. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. (2) In April 2008, the Company issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in 2018. 44 We have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse. In addition, from time to time we will discount, without recourse, letters of credit (LCs) received from customers in payment for goods. The following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of LCs and related discounting fees paid during the years ended June 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006: Year ended June 30, (in thousands) 2008 2007 2006 Receivables sold under factoring agreements $ 290,250 $ 278,560 $ 277,960 Proceeds from sales of LCs $ 39,379 $ 61,850 $ 69,286 Discounting fees paid on sales of LCs(1) $ 232 $ 804 $ 788 (1) Discounting fees were equivalent to interest expense and were recorded in interest and other income net. We maintain guarantee arrangements of $28.6 million in various locations to fund customs guarantee for VAT and LC needs of its subsidiaries in Europe and Asia. Approximately $20.8 million was outstanding under these arrangements as of June 30, 2008. We maintain certain purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply chain for key components. Our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecast time horizon can vary among different suppliers. We estimate our purchase commitment as of June 30, 2008 to be approximately $124.3 million, which are primarily due within the next 12 months. Actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may change in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. Certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties. We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. The actual product performance and or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty reserves accordingly. The difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited historical product performance to estimate warranty expense; more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates. Non standard warranty coverage generally includes services incremental to the standard 40 hour per week coverage for twelve months. See Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Working capital decreased to $2.1 billion as of June 30, 2008, compared to $2.2 billion as of June 30, 2007. This decrease is primarily due to cash payments for the share repurchase program and acquisitions in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 offset by cash generated from operations and the debt offering. As of June 30, 2008, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $1.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business, and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months. Our investment portfolio includes auction rate securities, which are investments with contractual maturities generally between 20 to 30 years. They are usually found in the form of municipal bonds, preferred stock, and a pool of student loans or collateralized debt obligations whose interest rates are reset, typically every seven to 45 forty nine days, through an auction process. At the end of each reset period, investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par. The auction rate securities held by us are backed by student loans and are collateralized, insured and guaranteed by the United States Federal Department of Education. In addition, all auction rate securities held by us are rated by the major independent rating agencies as either AAA or Aaa. In February 2008, auctions failed for approximately $48.2 million in par value of municipal auction rate securities we held because sell orders exceeded buy orders. These failures are not believed to be a credit issue, but rather caused by a lack of liquidity. The funds associated with these failed auctions may not be accessible until the issuer calls the security, a successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the auction process, or the security matures. As a result, we have classified these securities with failed auctions as long term assets in our consolidated balance sheet. During the quarter ended June 30, 2008, $4.8 million of the auction rate securities with a net book value of $4.6 million was called at par by the issuer; therefore no losses were recognized on this security. The balance of our long term marketable securities at June 30, 2008 was $42.1 million. Although we believe these securities continue to represent sound investments, we may be forced to sell some of our auction rate securities portfolio under illiquid market conditions, which could result in our recognizing a loss on such sales. As of June 30, 2008, we recorded a temporary impairment charge of $0.8 million (net of tax of $0.5 million) in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders equity. We estimated the fair value using a discounted cash flow model incorporating assumptions that market participants would use in their estimates of fair value. Some of these assumptions include estimates for interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows and expected holding periods of the auction rate securities. Based on our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash, we do not believe that any reduction in liquidity of our municipal auction rate securities will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Under our foreign currency risk management strategy, we utilize derivative instruments to protect our interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates. This financial exposure is monitored and managed as an integral part of our overall risk management program which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. We continue our policy of hedging our current and forecasted foreign currency exposures with hedging instruments having tenors of up to 18 months. The outstanding hedge contracts, with maximum maturity of 13 months, were as follows: As of June 30, (in thousands) 2008 2007 Cash flow hedge contracts Purchase $ 7,413 $ 4,651 Sell (200,676 ) (242,942 ) Other foreign currency hedge contracts Purchase 1,278,395 126,992 Sell (1,402,119 ) (265,378 ) Net $ (316,987 ) $ (376,677 ) 46 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. To mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency hedges. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of June 30, 2008. Actual results may differ materially. As of June 30, 2008, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of $451.3 million, excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents (detail of these securities is included in Note 3, Marketable Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements found under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report on Form 10 K). These securities, as with all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10% from levels as of June 30, 2008, the fair value of the portfolio would decline by $1.4 million. As of June 30, 2008, we had net forward and option contracts to sell $317.0 million in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures (detail of these contracts and hedging activities is included in Note 14, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities to the Consolidated Financial Statements). If we had entered into these contracts on June 30, 2008, the U.S. dollar equivalent would have been $359.7 million. A 10% adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by $44.8 million. However, if this occurred, the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount. Accordingly, we believe that, as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure, changes in most relevant foreign currency exchange rates should have no material impact on income or cash flows. See Note 3, Marketable Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements; Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources,; and Item 1A, Risk Factors elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for a description of recent market events that may affect the liquidity of certain municipal auction rate securities that we held at June 30, 2008. In April 2008, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.90% senior unsecured notes due in 2018. The fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. At June 30, 2008, the book value and the fair value of our fixed rate debt were $744.7 million and $728.9 million, respectively. 47
