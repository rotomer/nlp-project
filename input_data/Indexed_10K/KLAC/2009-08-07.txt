ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. This discussion contains forward looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. (See Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements.) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We based these estimates and assumptions on historical experience, and evaluate them on an on going basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the Companys related disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows: Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the sellers price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. We derive revenue from three sources sales of systems, spare parts and services. We typically recognize revenue for system sales upon acceptance by the customer that the system has been installed and is operating according to predetermined specifications. Under certain circumstances, however, we recognize revenue prior to written acceptance from the customer, as follows: When system sales to independent distributors have no installation requirement, contain no acceptance agreement, and 100% payment is due upon shipment, revenue is recognized upon shipment. When the installation of the system is deemed perfunctory, revenue is recognized upon shipment. The portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation. When the customer fab has already accepted the same tool, with the same specifications, and it can be objectively demonstrated that the tool meets all of the required acceptance criteria upon shipment, revenue is recognized upon shipment. The portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation. When the customer withholds signature on our acceptance document due to issues unrelated to product performance, revenue is recognized when the system is performing as intended and meets all published and contractually agreed specifications. When the system is damaged during transit and title has passed to the customer, revenue is recognized upon receipt of cash payment from the customer. Total revenue recognized without a written acceptance from the customer was approximately 14%, 16% and 14% of total revenues for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in revenue recognized without a written acceptance for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 is primarily driven by lower shipments of tools that have already met the required acceptance criteria at those customer fabs. The increase in revenue recognized without a written acceptance for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 is primarily driven by 34 Table of Contents increase in sales of systems with perfunctory installation, primarily with respect to sales of products of companies that we have acquired during the past two fiscal years. Shipping charges billed to customers are included in system revenue, and the related shipping costs are included in costs of revenues. Trade in rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection with subsequent purchases. We estimate the value of the trade in right and reduce the revenue of the initial sale. This amount is recognized at the earlier of the exercise of the trade in right or the expiration of the trade in right. Spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped, risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable. Service and maintenance contract revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract. Services performed in absence of a contract, such as consulting and training revenue, are recognized when the related services are performed, and collectability is reasonably assured. The deferred system profit balance equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment, less applicable product and warranty costs. We also defer the fair value of non standard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue. Non standard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40 hour per week coverage for twelve months. Non standard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences. Software is incidental to our products as determined in accordance with AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition and Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03 05, Applicability of SOP 97 2 to Non Software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing More Than Incidental Software. We periodically review the software element of our systems in accordance with SOP No. 97 2 and EITF Issue No. 03 05. Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first in, first out basis) or market. Demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost, and reserves are recorded to state the demonstration units at their net realizable value. We review the adequacy of our inventory reserves on a quarterly basis. We review and set standard costs semi annually at current manufacturing costs in order to approximate actual costs. Our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage) are recognized as current period charges. We write down inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence. These factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand, and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values. Warranty. We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. Utilizing actual service records, we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the actual labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge. We update these estimated charges on a quarterly basis. The actual product performance and or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty reserves accordingly. The difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited historical product performance to estimate warranty expense; more mature 35 Table of Contents products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates. See Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. A majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world. In order to monitor potential credit losses, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of all accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance. We take into consideration (1) any circumstances of which we are aware of a customers inability to meet its financial obligations; and (2) our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers. If circumstances change, such that the financial conditions of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us, we may need to take additional allowances, which would result in a reduction of our net income. Stock Based Compensation. Effective July 1, 2005, we adopted the modified prospective transition method as provided by provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. SFAS No. 123(R) establishes accounting for stock based awards exchanged for employee services. Accordingly, the fair value of stock based awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the employees requisite service period. The fair value is determined using a Black Scholes valuation model for stock options and for purchase rights under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date for restricted stock units. The Black Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the options expected life and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock. The expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the market based implied volatility from traded options of our common stock. We believe that the implied volatility is reflective of market conditions. Prior to July 1, 2005, we applied Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and its related Interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. Contingencies and Litigation. We are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. As required by SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment tests annually, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair value based approach. Purchased technology, patents, trademarks and other intangible assets are presented at cost, net of accumulated amortization. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis which approximates their estimated useful lives and assessed for impairment under SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. See Note 6, Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination. We conducted our annual evaluation of goodwill by reporting unit during the quarter ended December 31, 2008, and concluded that the carrying value of our Metrology reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. Our impairment evaluation of goodwill was based on comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying value. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates and operating margins, discount rates and future market conditions, among others. Unanticipated changes in revenue, gross margin, long term growth factor or discount rate could result in a material impact on the estimated fair values of our reporting units. There have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to the impairment test performed in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. 36 Table of Contents Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We have determined that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover all of our deferred tax assets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we could be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not probable. On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. We carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. As a result of the implementation of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed within the interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. We adopted FIN 48 on July 1, 2007. See Note 12, Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Valuation of Marketable Securities. Our investments in available for sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, as reported on our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity. However, changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the securitys cost basis. We periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other than temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the duration of the investment, the extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment, and our ability and intent to hold the investment until the earlier of market price recovery or maturity. Our assessment that an investment is not other than temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment. Fair Value Measurements. We adopted SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, as of the beginning of fiscal year 2009. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) SFAS No. 157 2, which allows companies to elect a one year delay in applying SFAS No. 157 to certain fair value measurements, primarily related to nonfinancial instruments. We elected the delayed adoption date for the portions of SFAS No. 157 impacted by FSP SFAS No. 157 2. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for 37 Table of Contents measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined under SFAS No. 157 as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value under SFAS No. 157 must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. See Note 2, Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Concurrently with our adoption of SFAS No. 157, we adopted SFAS No. 159, Establishing the Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities, which permits entities to elect, at specified election dates, to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value. See Note 2, Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Effects of Recent Accounting Pronouncements. In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 168, The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles a replacement of FASB Statement No. 162. SFAS No. 168 establishes the FASB Accounting Standards Codification as the source of authoritative accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. This SFAS is effective for our interim reporting period ending on September 30, 2009. This SFAS is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R). SFAS No. 167 changes how a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting (or similar rights) should be consolidated. The determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based on, among other things, an entitys purpose and design and a companys ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance. This SFAS is effective for our interim reporting period ending on September 30, 2010. We are currently evaluating the impact of the implementation of SFAS No. 167 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In May 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 165, Subsequent Events. SFAS No. 165 is intended to establish general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. This SFAS requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date. The disclosure requirement under this SFAS is effective for our annual reporting for the fiscal year ended on June 30, 2009. In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 141(R) 1, Accounting for Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination That Arise from Contingencies. FSP SFAS No. 141(R) 1 will amend the provisions related to the initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination under SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations. The FSP will carry forward the requirements in SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, for acquired contingencies, thereby requiring that such contingencies be recognized at fair value on the acquisition date if fair value can be reasonably estimated during the allocation period. Otherwise, entities would typically account for the acquired contingencies in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. The FSP will have the same effective date as SFAS No. 141(R), and will therefore be effective for our business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after July 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact of the implementation of FSP SFAS No. 141(R) 1 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 38 Table of Contents In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 157 4, Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly. FSP SFAS No. 157 4 provides guidelines for making fair value measurements more consistent with the principles presented in SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. The FSP relates to determining fair values when there is no active market or where the price inputs being used represent distressed sales. It reaffirms what SFAS No. 157 states is the objective of fair value measurement to reflect how much an asset would be sold for in an orderly transaction (as opposed to a distressed or forced transaction) at the date of the financial statements under current market conditions. Specifically, it reaffirms the need to use judgment to ascertain if a formerly active market has become inactive and in determining fair values when markets have become inactive. The FSP is effective for our annual reporting for the fiscal year ended on June 30, 2009. The implementation of FSP SFAS No. 157 4 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 107 1 and APB 28 1, Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments. FSP SFAS No. 107 1 and APB 28 1 enhances consistency in financial reporting by increasing the frequency of fair value disclosures. The FSP relates to fair value disclosures for any financial instruments that are not currently reflected on a companys balance sheet at fair value. Prior to the effective date of this FSP, fair values for these assets and liabilities have only been disclosed once a year. The FSP will now require these disclosures on a quarterly basis, providing qualitative and quantitative information about fair value estimates for all those financial instruments not measured on the balance sheet at fair value. The disclosure requirement under this FSP is effective for our interim reporting period ending on September 30, 2009. In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 115 2 and SFAS No. 124 2, Recognition and Presentation of Other Than Temporary Impairments. FSP SFAS No. 115 2 and SFAS No. 124 2 provides additional guidance designed to create greater clarity and consistency in accounting and presenting impairment losses on securities. The FSP is intended to bring greater consistency to the timing of impairment recognition, and provide greater clarity to investors about the credit and noncredit components of impaired debt securities that are not expected to be sold. The measure of impairment in comprehensive income remains fair value. The FSP also requires increased and more timely disclosures regarding expected cash flows, credit losses, and an aging of securities with unrealized losses. The FSP is effective for our annual reporting for the fiscal year ended on June 30, 2009. The implementation of FSP SFAS No. 115 2 and SFAS No. 124 2 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 132(R) 1, Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets. FSP SFAS No. 132(R) 1 amends SFAS No. 132(R) to provide guidance on an employers disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. The FSP requires disclosures surrounding how investment allocation decisions are made, including the factors that are pertinent to an understanding of investment policies and strategies. The disclosure requirement under this FSP is effective for our fiscal year beginning July 1, 2009. In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 157 3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset is Not Active. FSP SFAS No. 157 3 clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157, which we adopted as of July 1, 2008, in situations where the market for a particular financial asset is not active. We have considered the guidance provided by FSP SFAS No. 157 3 in its determination of estimated fair values, and the impact was not material. On August 27, 2008, the SEC announced that they will issue for comment a proposed roadmap regarding the potential use by U.S. issuers of financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). IFRS is a comprehensive series of accounting standards published by the International Accounting Standards Board. Under the proposed roadmap, we could be required in fiscal year 2014 to prepare financial statements in accordance with IFRS. The SEC is expected to make a determination in 39 Table of Contents 2011 regarding the mandatory adoption of IFRS. We are currently assessing the impact that this potential change would have on our consolidated financial statements, and we will continue to monitor the development of the potential implementation of IFRS. In April 2008, the FASB adopted FSP SFAS No. 142 3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets, amending the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. This FSP is effective for intangible assets acquired on or after July 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact of the implementation of FSP SFAS No. 142 3 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In February 2008, the FASB adopted FSP SFAS No. 157 2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, delaying the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for one year for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). We are currently evaluating the impact of the implementation of the deferred portion of SFAS No. 157 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (Revised 2007), Business Combinations. SFAS No. 141(R) retains the fundamental requirements of the original pronouncement requiring that the purchase method be used for all business combinations. SFAS No. 141(R) defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination, establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves control and requires the acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest at their fair values as of the acquisition date. In addition, SFAS No. 141(R) requires expensing of acquisition related and restructure related costs, remeasurement of earn out provisions at fair value, measurement of equity securities issued for purchase at the date of close of the transaction and non expensing of in process research and development related intangibles. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for our business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after July 1, 2009, except that resolution of certain tax contingencies and adjustments to valuation allowances related to business combinations, which previously were adjusted to goodwill, will be adjusted to income tax expense for all such adjustments after July 1, 2009, regardless of the date of the original business combination. We are currently evaluating the impact of the implementation of SFAS No. 141(R) on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51. This SFAS amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. It requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest. This SFAS establishes a single method of accounting for changes in a parents ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation. SFAS No. 160 is effective for our fiscal year beginning July 1, 2009. This SFAS is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 40 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE SUMMARY KLA Tencor Corporation is a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries. Within our primary area of focus, our comprehensive portfolio of products, services, software and expertise helps integrated circuit (IC or chip) manufacturers manage yield throughout the entire wafer fabrication process from research and development to final volume production. In addition to the semiconductor industry, our technologies serve a number of other industries, including light emitting diode (LED), data storage, solar process development and control, and general materials research. Our products and services are used by virtually every major wafer, IC and photomask manufacturer in the world. Our revenues are driven largely by capital spending by our customers who operate in one or more of several key semiconductor markets, including the memory, foundry and logic markets. Our customers purchase our products either in response to the need to drive advances in process technologies or to ramp up production to satisfy demand from industries such as communication, data processing, consumer electronics, automotive and aerospace. We believe that, over the long term, our customers will continue to invest in advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules and higher density applications, as well as reduced cost, which in turn will drive increased adoption of process control to reduce defectivity. As a supplier to the global semiconductor and semiconductor related industries, we are subject to business cycles, the timing, length and volatility of which can be difficult to predict. The industries we serve have historically been cyclical due to sudden changes in demand and manufacturing capacity. We expect our customers technology related capital spending on process control (as differentiated from capacity related capital spending) to increase over the long term, as technology spending is driven by the demand for more precise diagnostics capabilities to address multiple new defects as a result of further shrinking of device feature sizes, the transition to new materials, new devices and circuit architecture, new lithography challenges and fab process innovation. However, our ability to predict future capacity related capital spending by our customers is more limited, as such spending is more closely connected to the unpredictable business cycles within their industries. The demand for our products is generally affected by the profitability of our customers, which is driven by capacity and market supply for their products. While semiconductor content in communication, data processing, consumer electronics, automotive and aerospace products continues to increase, the global economic weakness has adversely impacted our customers that operate in those industries. During the recent economic downturn, the demand for our products has been adversely affected by lower profitability of our customers, especially in the memory market, as well as the weak macroeconomic and credit environment and its overall impact on capital spending. Our results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 reflect the impact of the global economic downturn and the resulting contraction in near term demand for semiconductor and nanoelectronic manufacturing equipment. Several of our customers have reduced their expenditures for production equipment in response to declining sales of their end products and resulting reductions in the utilization of existing manufacturing capacity. Although some customers continue to invest in equipment that is critical to technology development, capacity related purchases have dropped to historically low levels. This decline was also a result of difficulty experienced by some customers in obtaining financing for their capital expenditure plans. We expect demand for semiconductor capital equipment to continue to remain weak until macroeconomic conditions improve. We cannot predict the severity or duration of the global economic downturn, or the resulting impact on our customer base or on our customers manufacturing strategies. However, as long as such conditions persist, we expect that our product order levels and revenues will remain depressed. We have taken significant steps to reduce our production levels and operating cost structure in alignment with expected near term order and revenue levels. We have lowered our production volumes in response to anticipated near term business levels in an effort to size our operations to expected demand levels. However, our reduced scale of operations has led to increased inventory related charges (as our manufacturing inventory 41 Table of Contents requirements decline) and reduced manufacturing capacity utilization, which has adversely impacted our results of operations. Declines in factory utilization by our customers have also resulted in lower service revenue levels and additional inventory related charges (due to the related decline in customer usage of our systems). During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, we announced global workforce reductions and other cost reduction efforts aimed at lowering our operating expenses in response to the demand environment, and we continue to evaluate further cost reduction activities as well as the need to further adjust production levels in the event that business conditions deteriorate further. These activities, if implemented, will result in additional near term charges. However, we believe that our cost reduction efforts, combined with our strategy and our ability to innovate and execute, will enable us to strengthen our relative competitive position in the current difficult business environment, and will put us in position to take advantage of long term growth opportunities when favorable business conditions emerge. We continuously evaluate strategic acquisitions and alliances to expand our technologies, product offerings and distribution capabilities. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, we completed the acquisition of ICOS Vision Systems Corporation NV. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, we completed the acquisition of the Microelectronic Inspection Equipment business unit (MIE business unit) of Vistec Semiconductor Systems.

The decline in revenues reflects the slowdown in worldwide demand for semiconductor equipment, as semiconductor manufacturers reduce capital spending and conserve cash in response to their business environment, even as their need for more precise diagnostics capabilities increases with technological advances. The weak macroeconomic and credit environments have adversely impacted the profitability of our customers, their access to capital and their capital spending and are likely to result in product revenues in the near term that are lower than our revenue levels in comparable periods during prior fiscal years. Product revenues decreased in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 as many of our customers, primarily in the memory markets, scaled back on their capacity investments as the market for their products weakened. In addition, as the macroeconomic environment deteriorated towards the end of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, semiconductor companies reduced their capital spending, which resulted in lower revenues for our products compared to those for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, two customers, Intel Corporation and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., accounted for more than 10% of total revenues. For each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, no customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, two customers, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Intel Corporation, accounted for more than 10% of net accounts receivable. For each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, no customer accounted for more than 10% of net accounts receivable. Service revenues Service revenues are generated from maintenance service contracts, as well as time and material billable service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period. The amount of service revenues generated is generally a function of the number of post warranty systems installed at our customers sites and the utilization of those systems. Service revenues decreased in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 as customers idled their under utilized production equipment in response to the recent weakness in the semiconductor industry and the deteriorating macroeconomic environment. Service revenues increased in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 as our installed base of equipment at our customers sites continued to grow. 43 Table of Contents Revenues by region Revenues by region for the periods indicated were as follows (in thousands): Year ended June 30, 2009 2008 2007 United States $ 372,887 24 % $ 518,851 21 % $ 647,813 24 % Europe & Israel 162,665 11 % 305,350 12 % 271,814 10 % Japan 437,081 29 % 617,214 24 % 600,861 22 % Taiwan 181,411 12 % 570,904 23 % 559,083 20 % Korea 187,624 12 % 225,119 9 % 288,756 11 % Asia Pacific 178,548 12 % 284,278 11 % 362,902 13 % Total $ 1,520,216 100 % $ 2,521,716 100 % $ 2,731,229 100 % A significant portion of our revenues continue to be generated in Asia, where a substantial portion of the worlds semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located, and we expect that will continue to be the case. Gross margin Our gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product and revenue mix, and is affected by variations in costs related to manufacturing and servicing our products. Our gross margin during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 was lower compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 due to lower product and service revenues, higher intangible assets amortization expense as a result of our acquisitions of ICOS and the MIE business unit, decreased manufacturing capacity utilization, and excess inventory write downs, which were partially offset by lower employee related expenses as a result of a number of cost reduction activities that we have undertaken. The following are costs that were recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008: $290.9 million for employee related expenses, compared to $375.2 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, $85.6 million charge for excess inventory write downs, compared to $42.2 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, and $48.2 million for amortization of intangibles, compared to $30.3 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. The decrease in gross margin during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 was primarily due to $21.4 million of inventory write downs related to disposal of service inventory as well as discontinued products in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. The following are costs that were recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007: $375.2 million for employee related expenses, compared to $396.9 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, and $30.3 million for amortization of intangibles, compared to $33.9 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. 44 Table of Contents Engineering, Research and Development (R&D) Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2009 2008 2007 FY09 vs. FY08 FY08 vs. FY07 R&D expenses $ 371,463 $ 409,973 $ 427,515 $ (38,510 ) 9 % $ (17,542 ) 4 % Stock based compensation expense included in R&D expenses $ 33,127 $ 32,623 $ 42,431 $ 504 2 % $ (9,808 ) 23 % R&D expenses as a percentage of total revenues 24 % 16 % 16 % 8 % 0 % R&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 decreased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. The decrease is primarily attributable to reduced employee related expenses as a result of a number of cost reduction activities that we have undertaken, as well as reduced engineering material costs due to a reduced number of projects during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. These decreases were partially offset by additional R&D spending as a result of our acquisitions of ICOS and the MIE business unit. The following are expenses that were recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008: $220.8 million for employee related expenses, compared to $226.5 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, $97.9 million for engineering material costs, compared to $112.7 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, $31.6 million for outside services such as consulting and legal, compared to $36.8 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, $31.1 million for depreciation of fixed assets, amortization of intangibles and expensed in process R&D (IPR&D), compared to $47.4 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, and $21.7 million of benefit to R&D expense from external funding, compared to $20.4 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. The decrease in R&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 is primarily attributable to lower stock based compensation expense due to our transition from granting stock options to our employees to granting restricted stock units, which carry with them lower stock based compensation expense. The following are expenses that were recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007: $226.5 million for employee related expenses, compared to $254.5 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, $112.7 million for engineering material costs, compared to $104.7 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, $36.8 million for outside services such as consulting and legal, compared to $33.2 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, and $20.4 million of benefit to R&D expense from external funding, compared to $12.7 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we expensed IPR&D of $8.6 million, $22.7 million and $16.6 million, respectively, upon the completion of the acquisitions during the applicable fiscal year in connection with acquired intellectual property for which, as of the acquisition date, technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed. The fair value of the purchased IPR&D was determined using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows from projects to their net present value. Future cash flows were estimated, taking into account the expected life cycles of the products and the underlying technology, relevant market sizes and industry trends. We determined a discount rate for each 45 Table of Contents project based on the relative risks inherent in the projects development horizon, the estimated costs of development, and the level of technological change in the project and the industry, among other factors. IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been achieved and no future alternative uses existed. The development of these technologies remains a risk due to the remaining efforts to achieve technological feasibility, rapidly changing customer markets, uncertain standards for new products, and significant competitive threats. The nature of the efforts to develop these technologies into commercially viable products consists primarily of planning, designing, experimenting, and testing activities necessary to determine that the technologies can meet market expectations, including functionality and technical requirements. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we determined that we would not pursue future development of certain patents initially licensed to us during fiscal year 2006 for approximately $14.0 million. Since we did not have any alternative use for these patents and we believe the fair value to be $0, the carrying value of $10.7 million was written off. The write off was recorded as $10.0 million to R&D expense and $0.7 million to costs of revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. R&D expenses include the benefit of $21.7 million, $20.4 million and $12.7 million of external funding received during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, for certain strategic development programs primarily from government grants. We expect our R&D expenses to increase with increases in our business activity levels as we accelerate our investments in critical programs focusing on new technologies and enhancements to existing products. Our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace. To do this, we believe that we must continue to make substantial investments in our research and development. We remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the yield challenges our customers face at future technology nodes. Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Year ended June 30, (dollar amounts in thousands) 2009 2008 2007 FY09 vs. FY08 FY08 vs. FY07 SG&A expenses $ 415,126 $ 464,890 $ 513,525 $ (49,764 ) 11 % $ (48,635 ) 9 % Stock based compensation expense included in SG&A expenses $ 52,476 $ 51,806 $ 37,164 $ 670 1 % $ 14,642 39 % SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues 27 % 18 % 19 % 9 % 1 % SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 were lower compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 primarily due to lower expenses related to the shareholder litigation relating to our historical stock option practices and reduced employee related expenses as a result of a number of cost reduction activities that we have undertaken, which are partially offset by additional SG&A spending and higher intangible assets amortization expense as a result of our acquisitions of ICOS and the MIE business unit, additional bad debt expense and lower gain on sale of real estate assets. The following are expenses that were recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008: $328.0 million for employee related expenses, compared to $378.2 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, $23.2 million for bad debt expense, compared to $0.2 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, $59.2 million for depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangibles, compared to $34.3 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, 46 Table of Contents $13.9 million for expenses related to the shareholder litigation relating to our historical stock option practices, compared to $76.9 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, and $4.1 million in net gains recorded on the sale of real estate assets, compared to $20.1 million recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. The decrease in SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 is primarily attributable to gains recognized on sale of our certain real estate assets, lower severance and benefits related to employee workforce reductions, lower stock based compensation expense and improvements in our operational efficiency. The following are expenses that were recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007: $378.2 million for employee related expenses, compared to $408.4 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, $76.9 million for expenses related to the shareholder litigation relating to our historical stock option practices, compared to $14.7 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, $1.9 million for fixed asset impairment charges, compared to $56.8 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, and $20.1 million in net gains recorded on the sale of real estate assets, compared to no such gain recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. In November 2006, as part of our long term business plan, we decided to sell certain real estate properties that we owned in San Jose, California and Livermore, California. Based on the valuation of these assets, we recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately $56.8 million, which has been included in selling, general and administrative expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. See Note 18, Sale and Impairment of Real Estate Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. On October 16, 2006, following the Special Committee investigation of our historical stock option practices, we terminated all aspects of our employment relationship and agreement with Kenneth L. Schroeder, who ceased to be our Chief Executive Officer effective January 1, 2006 and had thereafter been employed as a Senior Advisor. As a result, vesting of Mr. Schroeders then outstanding stock options and restricted stock awards immediately ceased, and the 0.9 million unvested option shares and 0.1 million unvested restricted stock award shares held by Mr. Schroeder at the time of termination were canceled. Accordingly, in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we reversed $20.3 million of the non cash, stock based compensation charges in accordance with paragraphs 19 and 43 of SFAS No. 123(R), because Mr. Schroeder would no longer be able to fulfill his service obligations. The $20.3 million reversal related to the charges that had been recorded in prior periods related to unvested option shares and restricted stock award shares. In December 2006, we canceled 0.6 million vested option shares held by Mr. Schroeder as of the time of termination, representing those shares that had been retroactively priced or otherwise improperly granted. In accordance with paragraph 57 of SFAS No. 123(R), previously recognized stock based compensation expense related to these awards was not reversed upon cancellation. Impairment of Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets For the three months ended December 31, 2008, we performed our annual evaluation of goodwill by reporting unit and concluded that the carrying value of our Metrology reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result of the global economic downturn, reductions to our revenue and operating forecasts, and a significant reduction in our market capitalization, we determined that the goodwill related to our Metrology reporting unit was fully impaired. As a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $272.1 million during the three months ended December 31, 2008. 47 Table of Contents As a result of the aforementioned impairment indicators and in accordance with SFAS No. 144, we also performed an analysis utilizing discounted future cash flows related to the long lived and intangible assets to determine the fair value of each of our asset groups. Based on the assessment, we recorded an intangible asset impairment charge of $162.8 million related to existing technology, patents, customer relationships and trademarks, as well as an additional $2.0 million related to long lived assets, during the three months ended December 31, 2008. There have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill or purchased intangible assets subsequent to the impairment test performed in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. Restructuring Charges In March 2009, we announced a plan to further reduce our global workforce by approximately 10%, which followed our announcement in November 2008 of a global workforce reduction of approximately 15%. We are undertaking a number of cost reduction activities, including these workforce reductions, in an effort to lower our quarterly operating expense run rate in response to the current demand environment. The program in the United States is accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 112, Employers Accounting for Postemployment Benefits an amendment of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statements No. 5 and 43, whereas the programs in our international locations are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. We expect to recognize significant cost savings from a number of activities we have recently undertaken, including estimated annual cost savings of approximately $130 million as a result of the November 2008 and March 2009 workforce reductions. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, we recorded a $38.7 million net restructuring charge, of which $15.9 million was recorded to costs of revenues, $8.6 million to engineering, research and development expense and $14.2 million to selling, general and administrative expense. These charges represent the estimated minimum liability associated with expected termination benefits to be provided to employees. In addition, we are currently in the process of evaluating additional restructuring activities which, if implemented, may result in additional restructuring charges. The following table shows the activity primarily related to severance and benefits expense for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009: (In thousands) Year endedJune 30, 2009 Beginning Balance $ 1,333 Restructuring costs 40,596 Adjustments (1,912 ) Cash payments (31,931 ) Ending Balance $ 8,086 Substantially all of the restructuring charges related to our workforce reductions announced in November 2008 and March 2009 are expected to be paid out during the calendar year ending December 31, 2009. Interest Income and Other, Net Year ended June 30, (dollar amounts in thousands) 2009 2008 2007 Interest income and other, net $ 30,749 $ 71,625 $ 90,148 Interest expense $ 55,339 $ 10,767 $ 2,781 Interest income and other, net as a percentage of total revenues 2 % 3 % 3 % Interest expense as a percentage of total revenues 4 % 0 % 0 % 48 Table of Contents Interest income and other, net is comprised primarily of interest income earned on our investment and cash portfolio, realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities, as well as gains or losses recorded upon settlement of certain foreign currency contracts. The decrease in interest income and other, net during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 was primarily due to lower interest income from our investment and cash portfolio as well as lower foreign currency transaction gain. The decrease in interest income and other, net in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 is primarily due to the lower interest income earned on lower average cash balances during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. The increases in interest expense in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 as well as for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 were primarily due to additional interest expense as a result of the issuance of $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax provision was 13.1%, 35.9% and 22.2% in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our effective rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 included the effect of $276.6 million of goodwill impairment charges, which are non deductible for tax purposes. In addition, we recognized an expense of $38.1 million related to the effect of the New California Budget Legislation signed on February 20, 2009, which will allow for a taxpayer to elect an alternative method to attribute taxable income to California for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2011. We expect to make the election to use the alternative method to attribute taxable income to California for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2012. The expense included a reduction in non current deferred tax assets of $9.7 million and a $28.4 million valuation allowance on excess California research and development credits that we believe will not be utilized due to the effect of the lower apportionment rate. Our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 included $52.9 million of incremental U.S. tax expense associated with the implementation of our global manufacturing strategy. The incremental U.S. tax expense was a result of an inter company licensing agreement related to the migration of manufacturing to Singapore. That increase in our U.S. tax expense was partially offset by a benefit of $14.4 million that we recognized during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 resulting from revising the amount of prior year cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries considered to be permanently reinvested outside the United States. Our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 included a reduction in tax expense of $15.3 million resulting from the reduction in tax reserves primarily due to the resolution of an examination by the State of California for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1997 to June 30, 1999, receipt by the Company of a federal tax refund for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001, and the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxations confirmation of the Internal Revenue Services audit findings related to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of foreign operations, R&D tax credits, state taxes and tax audit settlements. Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre tax income, non tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions, research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pre tax income, and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. Windfall tax benefits arise when a companys tax deductions for employee stock activity exceeds book compensation for the same activity. A shortfall arises when the tax deduction is less than book compensation. Windfalls are recorded as increases to capital in excess of par value. Shortfalls are recorded as decreases to 49 Table of Contents capital in excess of par value to the extent that cumulative windfalls exceed cumulative shortfalls. Shortfalls in excess of cumulative windfalls are recorded as provision for income taxes. At June 30, 2009, we had cumulative windfalls in excess of shortfalls of approximately $6.0 million recorded as part of capital in excess of par value. In our fiscal year ending June 30, 2010, we expect cumulative shortfalls will begin to exceed cumulative windfalls since the adoption date of SFAS No. 123, and we will therefore report higher provision for income taxes as a result. Because we can not determine all of the factors that will enter into our income tax expense computation for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2010, we cannot currently estimate this impact on our tax rate for the next fiscal year.

We generated $195.7 million in cash from operations during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. We used $484.9 million in cash for investing activities and an additional $299.1 million for financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. We have historically financed our operations through cash generated from operations. Cash provided by operating activities was $195.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. Cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 consisted primarily of net loss of $523.4 million, offset by goodwill, purchased intangible asset and long lived asset impairment charges of $452.6 million, depreciation and amortization of $135.8 million, non cash stock based compensation of $105.5 million, a decrease in inventories of $120.2 million due to lower build plan as a result of lower bookings, and a decrease in accounts receivable of $277.3 million as collections exceeded shipments during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. These increases in operating cash flow were partially offset by changes in other assets and liabilities of $432.5 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. Cash provided by operating activities was $662.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. Cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 consisted primarily of net income of $359.1 million, increased by depreciation and amortization of $126.4 million, non cash stock based compensation of $106.5 million, a decrease in inventories of $100.2 million due to lower build plan as a result of lower bookings, and a decrease in accounts receivable of $149.3 million as collections exceeded shipments during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. These increases in operating cash flow were partially offset by changes in other assets and liabilities of $183.7 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. 50 Table of Contents Cash provided by operating activities in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 consisted primarily of net income of $528.1 million increased by depreciation and amortization of $109.3 million, non cash stock based compensation of $99.6 million and non cash impairment charges of $67.6 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $107.3 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $45.6 million, and changes in other assets and liabilities of $32.8 million. Investing activities typically consist of purchases and sales or maturities of marketable securities, purchases of capital assets to support long term growth and acquisitions of technology or other companies to allow access to new markets or emerging technologies. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, we paid $141.4 million for acquisition of the MIE business unit completed during the fiscal year. Also, sales of certain real estate assets during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 generated $21.8 million, which was offset by capital expenditures of $22.2 million. Financing activities include dividend payments to our common stockholders and sales and repurchases of our common stock. Issuances of common stock (net of applicable tax withholding payment) provided $27.9 million, $155.6 million and $263.2 million in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We used $226.5 million, $1,111.2 million and $808.5 million in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, to repurchase shares of our common stock. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, we announced plans to reduce our global workforce by approximately 15% and 10% in November 2008 and March 2009, respectively. We expect to recognize estimated annual cost savings of $130 million as a result of these reductions in workforce. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, we recorded a $38.7 million net restructuring charge, of which $31.9 million was paid out as of June 30, 2009, and the remaining balance is expected to be paid out by the end of calendar year 2009. We anticipate incurring additional severance costs and other related expense in connection with the workforce reductions at least through the remainder of calendar year 2009. The total amount of dividends paid during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $102.1 million, $108.5 million and $95.1 million, respectively. In February 2007, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program with a third party investment bank and prepaid $750.0 million to repurchase our common stock. The purchase price per share of the common stock repurchased through the ASR was determined and adjusted based on a discount to the volume weighted average price of our common stock during a period following the execution of the ASR agreement, subject to a maximum price per share. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we repurchased 14.0 million shares of our common stock under the ASR, of which 2.0 million shares were delivered to us in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. The shares repurchased under the ASR decreased our basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This decrease was partially offset by additional shares issued upon the exercise of employee stock options and in connection with stock purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. In October 2008, we suspended our stock repurchase program. 51 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following is a schedule summarizing our significant obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of June 30, 2009: Fiscal year ending June 30, (In thousands) Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Other Long term debt obligations(1) $ 750,000 $ $ $ $ $ $ 750,000 Interest expense associated with long term debt obligations 457,125 51,750 51,750 51,750 51,750 51,750 198,375 Purchase commitments 74,416 69,742 2,595 984 553 542 Non current income tax payable(2) 49,738 49,738 Operating leases 34,230 11,024 6,398 4,473 3,503 2,469 6,363 Pension obligations 17,565 1,258 1,549 1,489 1,455 1,765 10,049 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,383,074 $ 133,774 $ 62,292 $ 58,696 $ 57,261 $ 56,526 $ 964,787 $ 49,738 (1) In April 2008, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in 2018. (2) Represents the non current income tax payable obligation under FIN 48. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. We have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse. In addition, from time to time we will discount, without recourse, letters of credit (LCs) received from customers in payment for goods. The following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of LCs and related discounting fees paid during the years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007: Year ended June 30, (In thousands) 2009 2008 2007 Receivables sold under factoring agreements $ 262,998 $ 290,250 $ 278,560 Proceeds from sales of LCs $ 27,799 $ 39,379 $ 61,850 Discounting fees paid on sales of LCs(1) $ 145 $ 232 $ 804 (1) Discounting fees were equivalent to interest expense and were recorded in interest income and other, net. We maintain guarantee arrangements of $29.1 million in various locations to fund customs guarantees for VAT and LC needs of our subsidiaries in Europe and Asia. Approximately $18.9 million was outstanding under these arrangements as of June 30, 2009. We maintain certain purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply chain for key components. Our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecast time horizon can vary among different suppliers. We estimate our purchase commitments as of June 30, 2009 to be approximately $74.4 million, most of which is due within the next 12 months. Actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may change in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. Certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties. 52 Table of Contents We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. The actual product performance and or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty reserves accordingly. The difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited historical product performance to estimate warranty expense; more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates. Non standard warranty coverage generally includes services incremental to the standard 40 hour per week coverage for twelve months. See Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Working capital decreased to $1.8 billion as of June 30, 2009, compared to $2.1 billion as of June 30, 2008. This decrease is primarily due to cash payments for the share repurchase program, cash payments of dividends to stockholders and an acquisition in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 offset by cash generated from operations. As of June 30, 2009, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $1.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business, and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months. Our investment portfolio includes auction rate securities, which are investments with contractual maturities generally between 20 to 30 years. They are typically issued in the form of municipal bonds, preferred stock, a pool of student loans, or collateralized debt obligations whose interest rates are reset. The reset typically occurs every seven to forty nine days, through an auction process. At the end of each reset period, investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par. The auction rate securities held by us are backed by student loans and are collateralized, insured and guaranteed by the United States Federal Department of Education. In addition, all auction rate securities held by us are rated by the major independent rating agencies as either AAA or Aaa. In February 2008, auctions failed for approximately $48.2 million in par value of municipal auction rate securities that we held because sell orders exceeded buy orders. These failures are not believed to be a credit issue, but rather caused by a lack of liquidity. The funds associated with these failed auctions may not be accessible until the issuer calls the security, a successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the auction process, or the security matures. Prior to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, a total of $4.8 million of the auction rate securities with a net book value of $4.6 million were called at par by the issuer; therefore, no losses were recognized on these securities. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, an additional $2.8 million of the auction rate securities were called at par by the issuer; therefore, no losses were recognized on these securities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The fair value of our auction rate securities at June 30, 2009 was $38.2 million, which is included in marketable securities under current assets, as our intention is to exercise our right with UBS AG (UBS) to sell these auction rate securities at par value at the earliest date possible, which is June 30, 2010. By letter dated August 8, 2008, we received notification from UBS, in connection with a settlement entered into between UBS and certain regulatory agencies, offering to repurchase all of our auction rate security holdings at par value. We formally accepted the settlement offer and entered into a repurchase agreement (Agreement) with UBS on November 11, 2008 (Acceptance Date). By accepting the Agreement, we (1) received the right (Put Option) to sell our auction rate securities at par value to UBS between June 30, 2010 and June 30, 2012 and (2) gave UBS the right to purchase the auction rate securities from us any time after the Acceptance Date as long as we receive the par value. We expect to sell the auction rate securities under the Put Option. However, if the Put Option is not exercised before June 30, 2012, it will expire, and UBS will have no further rights or obligation to buy the auction rate securities. 53 Table of Contents UBSs obligations under the Put Option are not secured by its assets and do not require UBS to obtain any financing to support its performance obligations under the Put Option. UBS has disclaimed any assurance that it will have sufficient financial resources to satisfy its obligations under the Put Option. The Agreement covers $40.7 million par value (fair value of $38.2 million) of the auction rate securities held by us as of June 30, 2009. We are accounting for the Put Option as a freestanding financial instrument and elected to record the value under the fair value option of SFAS No. 159 during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. As a result, $2.4 million was recorded as an increase to interest income and other, net for the fair value of the Put Option during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The fair value of the Put Option at June 30, 2009 was $2.4 million. During the three months ended December 31, 2008, we made an election pursuant to SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, to transfer these auction rate securities from available for sale to trading securities. The transfer to trading securities reflects our intent to exercise the Put Option during the period June 30, 2010 to June 30, 2012. Prior to entering into the Agreement, our intent was to hold the auction rate securities until the market recovered. At the time of transfer, the unrealized loss on the auction rate securities was $1.3 million. Prior to the transfer, this unrealized loss had been included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Upon transfer of the auction rate securities to trading securities during the three months ended December 31, 2008, we immediately recognized an unrealized loss of $1.3 million, included in interest income and other, net, for the amount of the unrealized loss not previously recognized in earnings. Subsequently, we recognized an additional decline in fair value of $5.4 million for a total unrealized loss of $6.7 million, included in interest income and other, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended December 31, 2008. During the three months ended March 31, 2009, we recognized an increase in the fair value of the auction rate securities of $4.9 million, which is included in interest income and other, net. During the three months ended June 30, 2009, we recognized a decrease in the fair value of the auction rate securities of $0.7 million, which is included in interest income and other, net. We expect that the future changes in the fair value of the Put Option will continue to be largely offset by the fair value movements in the auction rate securities. We estimated the fair value of the auction rate securities using a discounted cash flow model incorporating assumptions that market participants would use in their estimates of fair value. Some of these assumptions include estimates for interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows and expected holding periods of the auction rate securities. We estimated the fair value of the Put Option using the expected value that we will receive from UBS, which was calculated as the difference between the anticipated recognized losses and par value of the auction rate securities as of the option exercise date. This value was discounted by using UBSs credit default swap rate to account for the credit considerations of the counterparty risk. We will reassess the fair value in future reporting periods based on several factors, including continued failure of auctions, failure of investments to be redeemed, deterioration of credit ratings of investments, market risk and other factors. Based on our expected operating cash flows and other sources of cash, we do not believe that any reduction in liquidity of our auction rate securities will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs. In April 2008, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.90% senior, unsecured long term debt due in 2018 with an effective interest rate of 7.00%. The discount on the debt amounted to $5.4 million and is being amortized over the life of the debt using the straight line method as opposed to the interest method due to immateriality. Interest is payable semi annually on November 1 and May 1. The debt indenture includes covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on our facilities and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to significant allowances under which certain sale and leaseback transactions are not restricted. We are in compliance with all of our covenants as at June 30, 2009. 54 Table of Contents Our credit ratings and outlooks as of July 23, 2009 are summarized below. Rating Agency Rating Outlook Fitch BBB Negative Moodys Baa1 Stable Standard & Poors BBB Negative Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries, our financial position, and changes in our business strategy. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Under our foreign currency risk management strategy, we utilize derivative instruments to protect our interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates. This financial exposure is monitored and managed as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. We continue our policy of hedging our current and forecasted foreign currency exposures with hedging instruments having tenors of up to 18 months (see Note 16, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description). Our outstanding hedge contracts, with maximum maturity of 13 months, were as follows: As of June 30, (In thousands) 2009 2008 Cash flow hedge contracts Purchase $ $ 7,413 Sell (36,938 ) (200,676 ) Other foreign currency hedge contracts Purchase 73,914 1,278,395 Sell (106,080 ) (1,402,119 ) Net $ (69,104 ) $ (316,987 ) 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. To mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency hedges. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of June 30, 2009. Actual results may differ materially. As of June 30, 2009, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of $804.9 million, excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents. These securities, as with all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10% from levels as of June 30, 2009, the fair value of the portfolio would decline by $2.0 million. See Note 4, Marketable Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements; Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources; and Item 1A, Risk Factors elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for a description of recent market events that may affect the liquidity of certain municipal auction rate securities that we held at June 30, 2009. As of June 30, 2009, we had net forward and option contracts to sell $69.1 million in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures (detail of these contracts and hedging activities is included in Note 16, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities to the Consolidated Financial Statements). If we had entered into these contracts on June 30, 2009, the U.S. dollar equivalent would have been $69.7 million. A 10% adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by $17.5 million. However, if this occurred, the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount. Accordingly, we believe that, as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure, changes in most relevant foreign currency exchange rates should have no material impact on our income or cash flows. In April 2008, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.90% senior unsecured notes due in 2018. The fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. At June 30, 2009, the book value and the fair value of our fixed rate debt were $745.2 million and $702.0 million, respectively. At June 30, 2008, the book value and the fair value of our fixed rate debt were $744.7 million and $728.9 million, respectively. 56 Table of Contents
