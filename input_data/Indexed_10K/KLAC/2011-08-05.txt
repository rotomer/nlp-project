ITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. This discussion contains forward looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. (See Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements.)CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIESThe preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience, and evaluate them on an on going basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our related disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows:Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. We derive revenue from three sourcessales of systems, spare parts and services. We typically recognize revenue for system sales upon acceptance by the customer that the system has been installed and is operating according to predetermined specifications. Under certain circumstances, however, we recognize revenue prior to acceptance from the customer, as follows:When system sales to independent distributors have no installation requirement, contain no acceptance agreement, and 100% payment is due upon shipment, revenue is recognized upon shipment.When the installation of the system is deemed perfunctory, revenue is recognized upon shipment. The portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation.When the customer fab has previously accepted the same tool, with the same specifications, and it can be objectively demonstrated that the tool meets all of the required acceptance criteria upon shipment, revenue is recognized upon shipment. The portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation.When the customer withholds acceptance due to issues unrelated to product performance, revenue is recognized when the system is performing as intended and meets all published and contractually agreed specifications.When the system is damaged during transit and title has passed to the customer, revenue is recognized upon receipt of cash payment from the customer.We enter into sales arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables of our products and services where certain elements of the sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted in one reporting period. Judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units. Additionally, judgment is required to interpret various commercial terms and determine when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period. While changes in the allocation of the estimated sales price between the accounting units will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular arrangement, any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.Trade in rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection with subsequent purchases. We estimate the value of the trade in right and reduce the revenue of the initial sale. This amount is recognized at the earlier of the exercise of the trade in right or the expiration of the trade in right.Spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped, risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable.32Service and maintenance contract revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract. If maintenance is included in an arrangement that includes a software license agreement, amounts related to maintenance are allocated based on fair value. Services performed in the absence of a contract, such as consulting and training revenue, are recognized when the related services are performed and collectibility is reasonably assured.The deferred system profit balance equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment, less applicable product and warranty costs. Deferred system revenue represents the value of products that have been shipped and billed to customers which has not met our revenue recognition criteria. Deferred system profit does not include the profit associated with product shipments to customers in Japan, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to customers in Japan are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance.We also defer the fair value of non standard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue. Non standard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40 hour per week coverage for twelve months. Non standard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences.Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first in, first out basis) or market. Demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and written down to their net realizable value. Our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and spoilage are recognized as current period charges. We write down product inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence and parts inventory based on forecasted usage. These factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand, and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values.Warranty. We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. Utilizing actual service records, we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the actual labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge. We update these estimated charges on a quarterly basis. The actual product performance and or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly. See Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description.Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. A majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world. In order to monitor potential credit losses, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of the accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance. We take into consideration (1) any circumstances of which we are aware of a customers inability to meet its financial obligations; and (2) our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers. If circumstances change, such that the financial conditions of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us, we may need to take additional allowances, which would result in a reduction of our net income.Stock Based Compensation. We account for stock based awards exchanged for employee services based on the fair value of those awards. The fair value of stock based awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the employees requisite service period. The fair value is determined using a Black Scholes valuation model for purchase rights under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date for restricted stock units. The Black Scholes option pricing model requires the input of assumptions, including the options expected life and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock. The expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the market based implied volatility from traded options of our common stock.Contingencies and Litigation. We are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We accrue a liability and recognize as expense the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months to defend or settle asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description.33Goodwill and Intangible Assets. We assess goodwill for impairment annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Long lived intangible assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. See Note 6, Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination. We conducted our annual evaluation of goodwill by reporting unit during the three months ended December 31, 2010 and concluded that there was no impairment. There have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to the impairment test performed in the three months ended December 31, 2010. The next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed in the three months ending December 31, 2011.Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. The guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We have determined that a valuation allowance was necessary against a portion of the deferred tax assets, but our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the remainder of our deferred tax assets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we could be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not probable.On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. We carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. In accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed within the interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained in audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.Valuation of Marketable Securities. Our investments in available for sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, as reported on our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity. However, changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the securitys cost basis. We periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other than temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the duration of the investment, the extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment, default and loss rates of the underlying collateral, structure and credit enhancements to determine if a credit loss may exist. Our assessment that an investment is not other than temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment.34Effects of Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn June 2011, the FASB amended its guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income. Under the amended guidance, an entity has the option to present comprehensive income in either one continuous statement or two consecutive financial statements. A single statement must present the components of net income and total net income, the components of other comprehensive income and total other comprehensive income, and a total for comprehensive income. In a two statement approach, an entity must present the components of net income and total net income in the first statement. That statement must be immediately followed by a financial statement that presents the components of other comprehensive income, a total for other comprehensive income, and a total for comprehensive income. The option under current guidance that permits the presentation of components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity has been eliminated. The amendment becomes effective retrospectively for our interim period ending March 31, 2012. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect that this guidance will have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows as it is disclosure only in nature.In May 2011, the FASB amended its guidance, to converge fair value measurement and disclosure guidance about fair value measurement under U.S. GAAP with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS"). IFRS is a comprehensive series of accounting standards published by the International Accounting Standards Board. The amendment changes the wording used to describe many of the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements. For many of the requirements, the FASB does not intend for the amendment to result in a change in the application of the requirements in the current authoritative guidance. The amendment becomes effective prospectively for our interim period ending March 31, 2012. Early application is not permitted. We do not expect the amendment to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.In December 2010, the FASB amended its guidance on goodwill and other intangible assets. The amendment modifies Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. For those reporting units, an entity is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if there are qualitative factors indicating that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. The qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance which requires goodwill of a reporting unit to be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. This amendment was effective for our interim period ended March 31, 2011. The amendment did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.In December 2010, the FASB amended its guidance on business combinations. Under the amended guidance, a public entity that presents comparative financial statements must disclose the revenues and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the prior annual reporting period. The amendment was effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date was on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010. Early adoption is permitted. The amendment did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.In April 2010, the FASB amended its guidance on share based payment awards denominated in certain currencies. The amendment clarifies that an employee share based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial portion of the entitys equity securities trades should not be considered to contain a condition that is not a market, performance or service condition. Therefore, an entity would not classify such an award as a liability if it otherwise qualifies as equity. This amendment becomes effective for our interim period ending September 30, 2011. We do not expect the implementation to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.In January 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for fair value measurements. This guidance now requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and also to describe the reasons for these transfers. This authoritative guidance also requires enhanced disclosure of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements. The guidance for Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements was effective for our interim reporting period ended March 31, 2010. The implementation did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows as it is disclosure only in nature. The guidance for Level 3 fair value measurements disclosures becomes effective for our interim reporting period ending September 30, 2011, and we do not expect that this guidance will have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows as it is disclosure only in nature.EXECUTIVE SUMMARYKLA Tencor Corporation is a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries. Our broad portfolio of products and services primarily supports integrated circuit (IC or chip) manufacturers throughout the semiconductor fabrication process, from research and development to final volume production. We provide leading edge equipment, software and support that enable IC manufacturers to identify, resolve and 35manage significant advanced technology manufacturing process challenges and obtain higher finished product yields at lower overall cost. In addition to serving the semiconductor industry, we also provide a range of technology solutions to a number of other high technology industries, including the light emitting diode (LED), data storage and photovoltaic industries, as well as general materials research.Our products and services are used by the vast majority of bare wafer, IC, lithography reticle ("reticle" or "mask") and disk manufacturers in the world. Our equipment, services and expertise are used by our customers to measure and control nanometric level manufacturing processes, and to detect, analyze and resolve critical product defects that arise in that environment. Our revenues are driven largely by our customers spending on capital equipment and related maintenance services necessary to support key transitions in their underlying product technologies, or to increase their production volumes in response to market demand. Our semiconductor customers generally operate in one or more of the three major semiconductor markets memory, foundry and logic. All three of these markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and sudden shifts in end user demand, which influences the level and pattern of our customers spending on our products and services. Although capital spending in all three semiconductor markets has been historically very cyclical, the demand for more advanced and lower cost chips used in a growing number of consumer electronics, communications, data processing, and industrial products has resulted in favorable long term revenue growth rates for our process control and yield management solutions. We believe that, over the long term, our customers will continue to invest in advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules and higher density applications, as well as to reduce cost. We expect that this in turn will drive long term increased adoption of process control equipment and services that reduce semiconductor defectivity and improve manufacturing yields.As a supplier to the global semiconductor and semiconductor related industries, we are subject to the cyclical capital spending that characterizes these industries. The timing, length and volatility of a capacity oriented capital spending cycle of our customers are unpredictable. In addition, our customer base continues to become more highly concentrated over time, thereby increasing the potential impact of a sudden change in capital spending by a major customer on our revenues and profitability. Nonetheless, we believe that over the long term our customers will continue to increase their total spending on process control and yield management solutions, in response to the challenges posed by shrinking device sizes, the transition to new production materials, new device and circuit architecture, more demanding lithography processes, the transition from 300 millimeter to 450 millimeter wafers, and new back end packaging techniques.The growing use of increasingly sophisticated semiconductor devices in communications, consumer electronics, data processing, and automotive and aerospace products, combined with a somewhat improved economic environment during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, particularly in Asia, caused many of our customers to invest in additional semiconductor manufacturing capabilities and capacity. These investments included process control and yield management equipment and services, which had a significant favorable impact on our revenues, compared to the prior fiscal year. The resulting increase in revenues allowed us to leverage our infrastructure and improve manufacturing capacity utilization, driving an improvement in gross margin as a percentage of revenue, again as compared to the previous year.In recent weeks, however, there have been indications that the industry demand environment may be slowing in the near term, as some of our customers appear to be reassessing their capacity expansion plans and timelines. Nevertheless, we believe that our customers remain committed to their roadmaps toward shrinking device sizes and other technological advancements as a means for driving future competitive differentiation and to lower costs, leaving the longer term drivers underlying growth in our industry intact.The following table sets forth some of our key consolidated financial information for each of our last three fiscal years: Year ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)2011 2010 2009Total revenues$3,175,167 $1,820,760 $1,520,216Costs of revenues$1,259,243 $815,662 $864,824Gross margin percentage60% 55% 43%Net income (loss)$794,488 $212,300 $(523,368)Diluted income (loss) per share$4.66 $1.23 $(3.07)The results for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2011 and 2010 reflected improved fundamentals in the semiconductor industry driven by reduced uncertainty over the global economic environment and continued economic growth in much of Asia. As we increased our business activity levels and shipped more products to our customers during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, we continued to maintain cost discipline, which resulted in improved gross margins as well as net income.36The results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 were adversely impacted by the weak demand for semiconductor capital equipment and service due to the unfavorable global economic and industry conditions. The macroeconomic uncertainty led our customers to significantly reduce their factory operations and spending. While we took actions to restructure our operations and reduce our cost structure in response to the deteriorating market conditions, the rapid decline in revenues resulted in a significant deterioration in gross margins and a net loss. Our financial results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 also included significant charges associated with impairment of goodwill, purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets, as well as restructuring programs. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, we completed the acquisition of the Microelectronic Inspection Equipment business unit (MIE business unit) of Vistec Semiconductor Systems for net cash consideration of $141.4 million. The acquired MIE business unit is a provider of mask registration measurement tools, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) based tools for mask critical dimension measurement and macro defect inspection systems.

Many of our customers continued to maintain high levels of capital spending for advanced technology development as well as capacity related investments, resulting in an increase in the number of tools that we sold and revenues that we recognized across each of the three major semiconductor markets (memory, foundry and logic), compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. Our revenues have continued to grow each quarter over the past two years, as we continued to increase production, ship products and provide services to our customers to meet their process control and yield management requirements. An increase in the sales of both our defect inspection and metrology equipment contributed to the increase in the number of tools that we sold during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010.Product revenues increased in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 as a result of increased capital spending by customers for both technology and capacity related investments of process control equipment, in response to strong semiconductor electronics end market demand. New semiconductor manufacturing products targeted towards advanced production nodes were significant contributors to this increase in revenue as customers, particularly those serving the foundry market, added production capacity. These factors contributed to an increase in the number of tools that we sold during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The increase in tool sales over fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 was primarily driven by an increase in our sales of defect inspection equipment.For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the following customers each accounted for more than 10% of total revenues:Year ended June 30,2011 2010 2009Intel Corporation Intel Corporation Intel CorporationTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. 37Service revenuesService revenues are generated from maintenance contracts, as well as billable time and material service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period. The amount of service revenues generated is generally a function of the number of post warranty systems installed at our customers sites and the utilization of those systems. Service revenues continued to steadily increase during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal years ended June 30, 2010 and 2009 as a result of an increase in the number of post warranty systems installed at our customers sites as well as higher factory utilization by our customers. Revenues by regionRevenues by region for the periods indicated were as follows: Year ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)2011 2010 2009United States$610,955 19% $341,079 19% $372,887 24%Taiwan864,378 27% 688,089 38% 181,411 12%Japan413,208 13% 239,393 13% 437,081 29%Europe & Israel340,249 11% 111,497 6% 162,665 11%Korea480,488 15% 151,198 8% 187,624 12%Rest of Asia465,889 15% 289,504 16% 178,548 12%Total$3,175,167 100% $1,820,760 100% $1,520,216 100%A significant portion of our revenues continue to be generated in Asia, where a substantial portion of the worlds semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located, and we expect that trend to continue.Gross marginOur gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product mix and is affected by variations in costs related to manufacturing and servicing our products, including our ability to scale our operations efficiently and effectively in response to prevailing business conditions. Over the past several years, we have embarked on various advanced product development, customer satisfaction improvement and globalization initiatives to improve our competitiveness and gross margins. Over the past eight quarters, our gross margin has generally benefited from the operating efficiencies associated with increasing revenues over that period. The following tables summarize the major factors that contributed to the changes in gross margin percentage: Gross Margin PercentageJune 30, 200943.1 %Revenue volume of products and service2.4 %Mix of products and services sold(1.5)%Manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies4.1 %Other service and manufacturing costs7.1 %June 30, 201055.2 %Revenue volume of products and service3.9 %Mix of products and services sold(0.1)%Manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies1.6 %Other service and manufacturing costs(0.3)%June 30, 201160.3 %Changes in gross margin percentage driven by revenue volume reflect our ability to leverage existing infrastructure to generate higher revenues. It also includes the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and average customer pricing. Changes in gross margin percentage from mix of products and services sold reflect the impact of changes in the composition within product and service offerings. Changes in gross margin percentage from manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies reflect our ability to manage costs and drive productivity as we scale our manufacturing activity to respond to customer requirements; this includes the impact of capacity utilization, use of overtime and variability of cost structure. Changes in gross 38margin percentage from other service and manufacturing costs include the impact of customer support costs, including the efficiencies with which we deliver services to our customers, and the effectiveness with which we manage our production plans and inventory risk.Our gross margin increased to 60.3% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 from 55.2% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 primarily due to increased demand and revenue from the sale of advanced technology defect inspection and metrology products.Our gross margin percentage increased to 55.2% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 from 43.1% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 primarily due to demand for new high value products, significant volume efficiencies in manufacturing operations worldwide, lower inventory obsolescence, as well as a lower overall manufacturing cost structure as a result of our outsourcing and globalization initiatives. In addition, productivity improvements resulting from better utilization of field service resources contributed to the gross margin improvement.Engineering, Research and Development (R&D) Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)2011 2010 2009 FY11 vs. FY10 FY10 vs. FY09R&D expenses$386,163 $329,560 $371,463 $56,603 17% $(41,903) (11)%R&D expenses as a percentage of total revenues12% 18% 24% (6)% (6)% R&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, primarily due to an increase in engineering material costs of $24.2 million for program development related to our next generation defect inspection products, an increase in employee related expenses of $27.8 million as a result of additional engineering headcount and higher variable compensation, and an increase in external services of $9.7 million to support expanded R&D activities, partially offset by an increase of $5.1 million in benefit to R&D expense from external funding. R&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 decreased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, even as we made significant investments in product research and development. The decrease during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 was primarily attributable to cost reduction activities initiated during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, the benefits of which were fully realized in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, partially offset by higher variable compensation. In addition, development material costs and consulting services related to R&D product development decreased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 as certain significant new products completed the product development cycle during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 and came to market in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. The decrease in R&D expenses primarily consisted of a decrease in employee related expenses of $11.2 million; a decrease in engineering material costs of $14.1 million; a decrease in external services of $5.1 million; and a decrease in depreciation of fixed assets, amortization of intangibles and expensed in process R&D (IPR&D) of $15.5 million; offset by a decrease in benefit to R&D expense from external funding of $8.0 million.During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, we expensed IPR&D of $8.6 million upon the completion of the acquisitions during the applicable fiscal year in connection with acquired intellectual property for which, as of the acquisition date, technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed. The fair value of the purchased IPR&D was determined using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows from projects to their net present value. Future cash flows were estimated, taking into account the expected life cycles of the products and the underlying technology, relevant market sizes and industry trends. We determined a discount rate for each project based on the relative risks inherent in the projects development horizon, the estimated costs of development, and the level of technological change in the project and the industry, among other factors. IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been achieved and no future alternative uses existed. The development of these technologies remains a risk due to the remaining efforts to achieve technological feasibility, rapidly changing customer markets, uncertain standards for new products, and significant competitive threats. The nature of the efforts to develop these technologies into commercially viable products consists primarily of planning, designing, experimenting and testing activities necessary to determine that the technologies can meet market expectations, including functionality and technical requirements.R&D expenses include the benefit of $18.8 million, $13.7 million and $21.7 million of external funding received during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, for certain strategic development programs primarily from government grants. We expect our R&D expenses to increase with increases in our business activity levels as we accelerate our investments in critical programs focusing on new technologies and enhancements to existing products.39Our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace. To do this, we believe that we must continue to make substantial investments in our research and development. We remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the yield challenges our customers face at future technology nodes.Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)2011 2010 2009 FY11 vs. FY10 FY10 vs. FY09SG&A expenses$369,431 $361,372 $415,126 $8,059 2% $(53,754) (13)%SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues12% 20% 27% (8)% (7)% SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 were higher compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 primarily due to increases in employee related expenses of $37.0 million as a result of additional headcount to support higher sales volume and higher variable compensation, partially offset by a decrease in asset impairment charges of $13.4 million, a decrease in legal expenses of $9.1 million related to our historical stock option practices and certain indemnification obligations, and an increase in bad debt recovery of $6.7 million. SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 were lower compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 primarily due to cost reduction activities initiated during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, the benefits of which were fully realized in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, partially offset by higher variable compensation. The decrease in SG&A expenses primarily consisted of a decrease in employee related expenses of $21.3 million and a decrease in depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangibles of $10.5 million, partially offset by an increase in legal expenses for stockholder litigation relating to our historical stock option practices of $3.0 million. In addition, $2.9 million of bad debt recovery was recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, compared to $23.2 million of bad debt expense recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. Interest Income and Other, Net Year ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)2011 2010 2009Interest income and other, net$4,064 $31,532 $30,749Interest expense$54,328 $54,517 $55,339Interest income and other, net as a percentage of total revenues0% 2% 2%Interest expense as a percentage of total revenues2% 3% 4%Interest income and other, net is comprised primarily of interest income earned on our investment and cash portfolio, realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities, gains or losses from revaluation of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities as well as foreign currency contracts, and impairments associated with equity investments in privately held companies. The decrease in interest income and other, net during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 was primarily attributable to impairment charges of $9.9 million recorded during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 for equity investments in privately held companies and partially offset by an international tax reserve benefit of $15.9 million due to the expiration of a statute of limitations relating to an uncertainty in our position with respect to a foreign transaction based tax during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. Interest income and other, net during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 remained flat. Interest expense is primarily attributable to the $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior fixed rate notes that we issued in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008.40Provision for Income TaxesThe following table provides details of income taxes: (In thousands)Year ended June 30, 2011 2010 2009Income (loss) before income taxes$1,110,066 $291,181 $(602,531)Provision for (benefit from) taxes315,578 78,881 (79,163)Effective tax rate28.4% 27.1% 13.1%The provision for income taxes differs from the statutory U.S. federal rate primarily due to foreign income with lower tax rates and tax credits, offset by state taxes, the tax effects of employee stock activity and other factors. Tax expense as a percentage of income during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 was 28.4% compared to 27.1% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. Tax expense increased primarily from an increase in state tax expense, a decrease in the benefit from lower income earned outside the U.S. with lower tax rates, and an increase in tax reserves, offset by a decrease in the effect of shortfalls from employee stock activity.Tax expense as a percentage of income during the year ended June 30, 2010 was 27.1% compared to a benefit of 13.1% as a percentage of a loss in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The difference in the percentages was primarily due to a decrease in the benefit on the loss incurred in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 from a goodwill impairment charge of $277.0 million related to certain business units, which was non deductible for tax purposes, and $38.1 million in additional tax expense due to a reduction in non current deferred tax assets. The reduction in the deferred tax asset was a result of the adoption of California budget legislation, signed on February 20, 2009, which will allow a taxpayer to elect an alternative method to attribute taxable income to California for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2011. We expect to make the election to use the alternative method to attribute taxable income to California for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2012. In addition, there was less income earned outside the U.S. subject to lower tax rates in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009.Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre tax income, non deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions, research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pre tax income, the domestic manufacturing deduction, non taxable or non deductible increases or decreases in the assets held within our Executive Deferred Savings Plan, the tax effects of employee stock activity and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies.We incurred $15.2 million and $12.0 million in additional tax expense during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, due to shortfalls from employee stock activity. Windfall tax benefits arise when a companys tax deduction for employee stock activity exceeds book compensation for the same activity. A shortfall arises when the tax deduction is less than book compensation. Windfalls are recorded as increases to capital in excess of par value. Shortfalls are recorded as decreases to capital in excess of par value to the extent that cumulative windfalls exceed cumulative shortfalls. Shortfalls in excess of cumulative windfalls are recorded as provision for income taxes. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2012, cumulative shortfalls from employee stock activity may continue to exceed cumulative windfalls from employee stock activity, and we may therefore report higher provision for income taxes as a result. Because we cannot determine all of the factors that will enter into our income tax expense computation for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2012, we cannot currently estimate this impact on our tax rate for the next fiscal year.In the normal course of business, we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.41Liquidity and Capital Resources As of June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)2011 2010 2009Cash and cash equivalents$711,329 $529,918 $524,967Marketable securities1,327,206 1,004,126 804,917Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$2,038,535 $1,534,0440$1,329,884Percentage of total assets44% 39% 37% Year ended June 30,(In thousands)2011 2010 2009Net cash provided by operating activities$823,166 $447,800 $195,684Net cash used in investing activities(359,510) (227,964) (484,900)Net cash used in financing activities(300,155) (216,331) (299,117)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents17,910 1,446 (14,806)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$181,411 $4,951 $(603,139)As of June 30, 2011, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2 billion, which is an increase of $504 million from June 30, 2010. As of June 30, 2011, $678 million of the $2 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. We currently intend to permanently reinvest approximately $421 million of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries. If, however, a portion of these funds were to be needed for our operations in the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. and foreign taxes of approximately 30% 50% of the funds repatriated. The amount of taxes due will depend on the amount and manner of the repatriation, as well as the location from where the funds are repatriated. We have accrued (but have not paid) U.S. taxes on the remaining cash of $257 million of the $678 million held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. As such, these funds can be returned to the U.S. without accruing any additional U.S. tax expense. The total amount of dividends paid during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $167 million, $102 million and $102 million, respectively. The increase in the total amount of dividends paid during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the preceding fiscal years reflects an increase during the quarter ended September 30, 2010 to the level of our quarterly dividend from $0.15 to $0.25 per share. On July 12, 2011, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a further increase in the level of our quarterly dividend from $0.25 to $0.35 per share.The shares repurchased under our stock repurchase program have decreased our basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding. The decrease was partially offset by additional shares issued upon the exercise of employee stock options and the vesting of employee restricted stock units and in connection with stock purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. In October 2008, we suspended our stock repurchase program, and we subsequently restarted the program in February 2010.We have historically financed our liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations. Fiscal Year 2011 Compared to Fiscal Year 2010Cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 from $448 million to $823 million primarily as a result of the following key factors:An increase in cash collections of approximately $1.4 billion during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, due to higher sales volume, partially offset byAn increase in vendor payments of approximately $580 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, to support a higher level of business activities,An increase in payroll expenses of approximately $170 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, mainly due to bonus payments for fiscal year 2010 (which were paid during fiscal year 2010 and higher headcount), andAn increase in tax payments of approximately $270 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, due to higher profitability.42Cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 from $228 million to $360 million primarily as a result of an increase in the use of cash for purchases of available for sale and trading securities, net of sales and maturities, of approximately $124 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010.Cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 from $216 million to $300 million as a result of the following key factors:An increase in dividend payments of $65 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, mainly due to an increase in the quarterly dividend payout amount which was announced in July 2010, andAn increase in common stock repurchases of $99 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, mainly due to the temporary suspension of our stock repurchase program from October 2008 to February 2010 due to market conditions, partially offset byAn increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $89 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. Fiscal Year 2010 Compared to Fiscal Year 2009Cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 from $196 million to $448 million primarily as a result of the following key factors:Lower operating expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, reduced by approximately $165 million compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, resulting primarily from our cost cutting measures initiated during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, the benefits of which were fully realized in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010,No material cash payments in the settlement of litigation during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, compared to a cash payment of $65 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 in connection with the settlement of the stockholder class action litigation related to our historical stock option practices, andAn increase in customer collections of approximately $58 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, partially offset byAn increase in taxes paid of approximately $26 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009.Cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 declined compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 from $485 million to $228 million primarily as a result of the following key factors:A decrease of $140 million in acquisitions, primarily driven by the acquisition of the MIE business unit during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, andA decrease in the use of cash for purchases of available for sale and trading securities, net of sales and maturities, of approximately $141 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, partially offset byA decrease in cash collections by approximately $16 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 from sale of assets, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009.Cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 declined compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 from $299 million to $216 million as a result of lower common stock repurchases. We repurchased $136 million of our common stock during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, compared to $227 million in stock repurchases during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009.43Contractual ObligationsThe following is a schedule summarizing our significant obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of June 30, 2011: Fiscal year ending June 30,(In thousands)Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter OtherLong term debt obligations(1)$750,000 $ $ $ $ $ $750,000 Interest expense associated with long term debt obligations353,625 51,750 51,750 51,750 51,750 51,750 94,875 Purchase commitments352,404 340,730 8,136 3,390 130 18 Non current income tax payable(2)85,537 85,537Operating leases24,987 7,992 6,001 3,889 2,106 1,869 3,130 Pension obligations27,556 2,001 1,240 2,185 2,927 2,466 16,737 Total contractual cash obligations$1,594,109 $402,473 $67,127 $61,214 $56,913 $56,103 $864,742 $85,537 (1)In April 2008, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in 2018.(2)Represents the non current income tax payable obligation and related accrued interest. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.We have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse. In addition, from time to time we will discount, without recourse, letters of credit (LCs) received from customers in payment for goods.The following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of LCs and related discounting fees paid for the years ended June 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009: Year ended June 30,(In thousands)2011 2010 2009Receivables sold under factoring agreements$313,578 $107,666 $262,998Proceeds from sales of LCs$140,534 $37,226 $27,799Discounting fees paid on sales of LCs(1)$213 $189 $145 (1)Discounting fees include bank fees and interest expense and were recorded in interest income and other, net.We maintain guarantee arrangements available through various financial institutions for up to $20.4 million, of which $17.9 million had been issued as of June 30, 2011 primarily to fund guarantees to customs authorities for VAT and other operating requirements of our subsidiaries in Europe and Asia. We maintain certain open inventory purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply for key components. Our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecasted time horizon can vary among different suppliers. Our open inventory purchase commitments were approximately $352 million as of June 30, 2011, and are primarily due within the next 12 months. Actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. Certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties.44We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. The actual product performance and or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly. The difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited historical product performance to estimate warranty expense; more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates. Non standard warranty coverage generally includes services incremental to the standard 40 hour per week coverage for twelve months. See Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description.Working capital increased to $2.8 billion as of June 30, 2011, compared to $2.1 billion as of June 30, 2010. This increase is primarily due to cash generated from operations, offset by cash payments for our stock repurchase program, cash payments of dividends to stockholders, and purchases of fixed assets. As of June 30, 2011, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $2.0 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business, and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months.Our credit ratings and outlooks as of July 11, 2011 are summarized below: Rating AgencyRating OutlookFitchBBB StableMoodysBaa1 StableStandard & PoorsBBB StableFactors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries, our financial position, and changes in our business strategy.Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsUnder our foreign currency risk management strategy, we utilize derivative instruments to protect our interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates. This financial exposure is monitored and managed as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. We continue our policy of hedging our current and forecasted foreign currency exposures with hedging instruments having tenors of up to 18 months (see Note 16, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description). Our outstanding hedge contracts, with maximum maturity of 18 months, were as follows: As of June 30,(In thousands)2011 2010Cash flow hedge contracts Purchase$3,381 $15,835Sell$30,133 $32,853Other foreign currency hedge contracts Purchase$174,499 $82,535Sell$216,738 $104,414Indemnification Obligations. Subject to certain limitations, we are obligated to indemnify our current and former directors, officers and employees with respect to certain litigation matters and investigations that arise in connection with their service to us. These obligations arise under the terms of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, applicable contracts, and Delaware and California law. The obligation to indemnify generally means that we are required to pay or reimburse the individuals reasonable legal expenses and possibly damages and other liabilities incurred in connection with these matters. We paid or reimbursed legal expenses incurred in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option practices and the related litigation and government inquiries by a number of our current and former directors, officers and employees. We are currently paying defense costs to one former officer and employee facing an SEC civil action to which we are not a party. 45Although the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these agreements is theoretically unlimited, we believe the fair value of this liability, to the extent estimable, is appropriately considered within the reserve we have established for currently pending legal proceedings.We are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise in connection with contracts and license agreements or the sale of assets, under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from, or provide customers with other remedies to protect against, bodily injury or damage to personal property caused by our products, non compliance with our product performance specifications, infringement by our products of third party intellectual property rights and a breach of warranties, representations and covenants related to such matters as title to assets sold, validity of certain intellectual property rights, non infringement of third party rights, and certain income tax related matters. In each of these circumstances, payment by us is typically subject to the other party making a claim to and cooperating with us pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract. This usually allows us to challenge the other partys claims or, in case of breach of intellectual property representations or covenants, to control the defense or settlement of any third party claims brought against the other party. Further, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of amounts, activity (typically at our option to replace or correct the products or terminate the agreement with a refund to the other party), and duration. In some instances, we may have recourse against third parties and or insurance covering certain payments made by us. It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.46ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. To mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency hedges. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of June 30, 2011. Actual results may differ materially.As of June 30, 2011, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of $1.3 billion, excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents. These securities, as with all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10% from levels as of June 30, 2011, the fair value of the portfolio would decline by $1.1 million.As of June 30, 2011, we had net forward and option contracts to sell $69.0 million in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures (detail of these contracts and hedging activities is included in Note 16, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities to the Consolidated Financial Statements). If we had entered into these contracts on June 30, 2011, the U.S. dollar equivalent would have been $69.1 million. A 10% adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by $18.3 million. However, if this occurred, the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount. Accordingly, we believe that, as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure, changes in most relevant foreign currency exchange rates should have no material impact on our income or cash flows.In April 2008, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.90% senior unsecured notes due in 2018. The fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. As of June 30, 2011, the book value and the fair value of our fixed rate debt were $746.3 million and $863.5 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2010, the book value and the fair value of our fixed rate debt were $745.7 million and $834.4 million, respectively.47
