ITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. This discussion contains forward looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. (See Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements.)CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIESThe preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience, and evaluate them on an on going basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our related disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are as follows:Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. We derive revenue from three sourcessales of systems, spare parts and services. We recognize revenue for system sales upon acceptance by the customer that the system has been installed and is operating according to predetermined specifications. Under certain circumstances, however, we recognize revenue prior to acceptance from the customer, as follows:When the customer fab has previously accepted the same tool, with the same specifications, and it can be objectively demonstrated that the tool meets all of the required acceptance criteria upon shipment, revenue is recognized upon shipment. The portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation.When system sales to independent distributors have no installation requirement, contain no acceptance agreement, and 100% payment is due based upon shipment, revenue is recognized upon shipment.When the installation of the system is deemed perfunctory, revenue is recognized upon shipment. The portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation.When the customer withholds acceptance due to issues unrelated to product performance, revenue is recognized when the system is performing as intended and meets all published and agreed upon specifications.When the system is damaged during transit and title has passed to the customer, revenue is recognized upon receipt of cash payment from the customer.We enter into sales arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables of our products and services where certain elements of the sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted in one reporting period. Judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units. Additionally, judgment is required to interpret various commercial terms and determine when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period. While changes in the allocation of the estimated selling price between the accounting units will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular arrangement, any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.Trade in rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection with subsequent purchases. We estimate the value of the trade in right and reduce the revenue recognized on the initial sale. This amount is recognized at the earlier of the exercise of the trade in right or the expiration of the trade in right.Spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped, risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable.34Table of ContentsService and maintenance contract revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract. Revenue from services performed in the absence of a maintenance contract, including consulting and training revenue, is recognized when the related services are performed and collectibility is reasonably assured.We sell stand alone software that is subject to the software revenue recognition guidance. We periodically review selling prices to determine whether vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) exists, and in some situations where we are unable to establish VSOE for undelivered elements such as post contract service, revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the service contract. We also defer the fair value of non standard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue. Non standard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40 hour per week coverage for twelve months. Non standard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences.The deferred system profit balance equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment, less applicable product and warranty costs. Deferred system revenue represents the value of products that have been shipped and billed to customers which have not met our revenue recognition criteria. Deferred system profit does not include the profit associated with product shipments to customers in Japan, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to customers in Japan are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance.Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first in, first out basis) or market. Demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and written down to their net realizable value. Our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and spoilage are recognized as current period charges. We write down product inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence and parts inventory based on forecasted usage and customer support requirements. These factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand, and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values.Warranty. We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. Utilizing actual service records, we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the actual labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge. We update these estimated charges on a quarterly basis. The actual product performance and or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly. See Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description.Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. A majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world. In order to monitor potential credit losses, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of the accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance. We take into consideration (1) any circumstances of which we are aware of a customers inability to meet its financial obligations; and (2) our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers. If circumstances change, such that the financial conditions of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us, we may need to record additional allowances, which would result in a reduction of our net income.Stock Based Compensation. We account for stock based awards granted to employees for services based on the fair value of those awards. The fair value of stock based awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the employees requisite service period. The fair value is determined using a Black Scholes valuation model for stock options and for purchase rights under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date for restricted stock units. The Black Scholes option pricing model requires the input of assumptions, including the options expected term and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock. The expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the market based implied volatility from traded options of our common stock.35Table of ContentsContingencies and Litigation. We are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We accrue a liability and recognize as expense the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months to defend or settle asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description.Goodwill and Intangible Assets. We assess goodwill for impairment annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Long lived intangible assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. See Note 5, Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination. We performed a qualitative assessment of the goodwill by reporting unit as of November 30, 2011 during the three months ended December 31, 2011 and concluded that there was no impairment. There have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to the impairment test performed in the three months ended December 31, 2011. The next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed in the three months ending December 31, 2012.If we were to encounter challenging economic conditions, such as a decline in our operating results, an unfavorable industry or macroeconomic environment, a substantial decline in our stock price, or any other adverse change in market conditions, we may be required to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment analysis. In addition, if such conditions have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we use to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets, we may be required to record goodwill and or intangible asset impairment charges in future periods, whether in connection with our next annual impairment assessment in the second quarter of fiscal year 2013 or prior to that, if any triggering event occurs outside of the quarter during which the annual goodwill impairment assessment is performed. It is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or, if it does, whether such charge would be material to our results of operations.Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. The guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We have determined that a valuation allowance was necessary against a portion of the deferred tax assets, but we anticipate that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the remainder of our deferred tax assets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we could be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable.On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. We carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. In accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed within the interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained in audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.Valuation of Marketable Securities. Our investments in available for sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, as reported on our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity. However, changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the securitys cost basis. We periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other than temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require us to record an 36Table of Contentsimpairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the duration of the investment, the extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment, default and loss rates of the underlying collateral, structure and credit enhancements to determine if a credit loss may exist. Our assessment that an investment is not other than temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment.Effects of Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standard update requiring enhanced disclosure about certain financial instruments and derivative instruments that are offset in the balance sheet or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement. The disclosure requirement becomes effective retrospectively in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2014. We do not expect that the requirement will have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows as it is disclosure only in nature.In September 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standard update intended to simplify testing goodwill for impairment. The amendment allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test. An entity will no longer be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The amendment becomes effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2013, and early adoption is permitted. We elected to early adopt this accounting guidance at the beginning of the three months ended December 31, 2011 (see Note 5, Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets, to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description). In June 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standard update requiring an increase in the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income. The amendment eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity and requires that the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income be presented in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The amendment also required presentation of adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income in the statement where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented, which was indefinitely deferred by the FASB in December 2011. The amendment (other than the portion regarding the presentation of reclassification adjustments which, as noted above, has been deferred indefinitely) becomes effective during the first quarter of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2013. Early adoption is permitted. The amendment will impact the presentation of the financial statements but will not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.In May 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standard update providing guidance on achieving a consistent definition of and common requirements for measurement of fair value between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). This amendment was effective prospectively for our interim reporting period ended March 31, 2012. Early application is not permitted. The amendment did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.In April 2010, the FASB amended its guidance on share based payment awards denominated in certain currencies. The amendment clarifies that an employee share based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial portion of the entitys equity securities trades should not be considered to contain a condition that is not a market, performance or service condition. Therefore, an entity would not classify such an award as a liability if it otherwise qualifies as equity. This amendment was effective for our interim reporting period ended September 30, 2011. The amendment did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.In January 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for fair value measurements. This guidance now requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and also to describe the reasons for these transfers. This authoritative guidance also requires enhanced disclosure of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements. The guidance for Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements was effective for our interim reporting period ended March 31, 2010. The implementation did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows as it is disclosure only in nature. The guidance for Level 3 fair value measurements disclosures was effective for our interim reporting period ended September 30, 2011, and the implementation of that guidance did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows as it is disclosure only in nature.37Table of ContentsEXECUTIVE SUMMARYKLA Tencor Corporation is a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries. Our broad portfolio of products and services primarily supports integrated circuit (IC or chip) manufacturers throughout the entire semiconductor fabrication process, from research and development to final volume production. We provide leading edge equipment, software and support that enable IC manufacturers to identify, resolve and manage significant advanced technology manufacturing process challenges and obtain higher finished product yields at lower overall cost. In addition to serving the semiconductor industry, we also provide a range of technology solutions to a number of other high technology industries, including the light emitting diode (LED), data storage and photovoltaic industries, as well as general materials research.Our products and services are used by the vast majority of bare wafer, IC, lithography reticle (reticle or mask) and disk manufacturers in the world. Our products, services and expertise are used by our customers to measure and control nanometric level manufacturing processes, and to detect, analyze and resolve critical product defects that arise in that environment. Our revenues are driven largely by our customers spending on capital equipment and related maintenance services necessary to support key transitions in their underlying product technologies, or to increase their production volumes in response to market demand. Our semiconductor customers generally operate in one or more of the three major semiconductor markets memory, foundry and logic. All three of these markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and sudden shifts in end user demand, which influence the level and pattern of our customers spending on our products and services. Although capital spending in all three semiconductor markets has historically been very cyclical, the demand for more advanced and lower cost chips used in a growing number of consumer electronics, communications, data processing, and industrial and automotive products has resulted in favorable long term revenue growth rates for our process control and yield management solutions. As a supplier to the global semiconductor and semiconductor related industries, we are subject to the cyclical capital spending that characterizes these industries. The timing, length, intensity and volatility of capacity oriented capital spending cycles of our customers are unpredictable. In addition, our customer base continues to become more highly concentrated over time, thereby increasing the potential impact of a sudden change in capital spending by a major customer on our revenues and profitability. The growing use of increasingly sophisticated semiconductor devices has caused many of our customers to invest in additional semiconductor manufacturing capabilities and capacity. These investments have included process control and yield management equipment and services and have had a significant favorable impact on our revenues.During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, our revenues and earnings remained robust compared to the prior several fiscal years as we responded to meet the high level of customer demand for our products, driven by the strong growth in the consumer mobile device markets. Our revenue levels in the next fiscal year will depend upon whether our customers maintain these elevated levels of investment in process control equipment. In addition to our revenue levels, our earnings for the next fiscal year will also depend on the amount of research and development spending that we embark upon in meeting our customers technology roadmaps. We cannot predict the duration and sustainability of these favorable business conditions. We have increased our production volumes and capacity to meet anticipated customer requirements and remain at risk of incurring significant inventory related and other restructuring charges, if business conditions deteriorate. We believe that, over the long term, our customers will continue to invest in advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules and higher density applications, as well as to reduce cost. We expect that this in turn will drive long term increased adoption of process control equipment and services that reduce semiconductor defectivity and improve manufacturing yields, reinforcing the longer term growth drivers in our industry.38Table of ContentsThe following table sets forth some of our key consolidated financial information for each of our last three fiscal years: Year ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)2012 2011 2010Total revenues$3,171,944 $3,175,167 $1,820,760Costs of revenues$1,330,016 $1,259,243 $815,662Gross margin percentage58% 60% 55%Net income$756,015 $794,488 $212,300Diluted income per share$4.44 $4.66 $1.23The results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 reflected favorable conditions we encountered as our customers, particularly the foundries, invested heavily in process control equipment to meet the strong demand driven by the mobile device markets.The results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 reflected improved fundamentals in the semiconductor industry as compared to the prior fiscal year, driven by reduced uncertainty over the global economic environment and continued economic growth in much of Asia. As we increased our business activity levels and shipped more products to our customers during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, we continued to maintain cost discipline, which resulted in improved gross margins as well as net income.Revenues and Gross Margin Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)2012 2011 2010 FY12 vs. FY11 FY11 vs. FY10Revenues: Product$2,597,755 $2,613,438 $1,324,270 $(15,683) (1)% $1,289,168 97%Service574,189 561,729 496,490 12,460 2 % 65,239 13%Total revenues$3,171,944 $3,175,167 $1,820,760 $(3,223) $1,354,407 Costs of revenues$1,330,016 $1,259,243 $815,662 $70,773 6 % $443,581 54%Gross margin percentage58% 60% 55% (2)% 5% Product revenuesProduct revenues were substantially flat (decreasing by 1%) in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. Revenues from sales of our metrology products increased year over year, primarily driven by the adoption of our latest generation products to support advanced patterning lithography and the introduction of 3 D structures in leading edge designs, but that increase was offset by a decrease in defect inspection product revenues due to the timing of customer purchases and reduction in the sale of product upgrades as we transitioned to our next generation platforms. Each of these twelve month periods was similarly highlighted by increased volumes of shipment and installation of our products to satisfy customer demand for process control equipment, particularly among foundries, as our customers encountered high levels of demand for semiconductors from electronics end markets.Product revenues increased in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 primarily as a result of increased shipment and acceptance of our products within the year. Many of our customers continued to maintain high levels of capital spending for advanced technology development as well as capacity related investments, resulting in an increase in the number of tools that we sold and revenues that we recognized across each of the three major semiconductor markets (memory, foundry and logic), compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. An increase in the sales of both our defect inspection and metrology equipment contributed to the increase in the number of tools that we sold during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010.39Table of ContentsService revenuesService revenues are generated from maintenance contracts, as well as billable time and material service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period. The amount of service revenues is generally a function of the number of post warranty systems installed at our customers sites and the utilization of those systems. Service revenues increased during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 compared to the fiscal years ended June 30, 2011 and 2010 as a result of an increase in the number of post warranty systems installed at our customers sites, as well as service work completed in the three months ended September 30, 2011 to assist our customers in Japan as their operations recovered from the effects of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. The following customers each accounted for more than 10% of total revenues for the indicated periods:Year ended June 30,2012 2011 2010Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.

Over the past several years, we have embarked on various advanced product development, customer satisfaction improvement and globalization initiatives to improve our competitiveness and gross margins. Over the past eight quarters, our gross margin has generally benefited from the operating efficiencies associated with elevated levels of revenues over that period. The following table summarizes the major factors that contributed to the changes in gross margin percentage: Gross Margin PercentageFiscal year ended June 30, 201055.2 %Revenue volume of products and service3.9 %Mix of products and services sold(0.1)%Manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies1.6 %Other service and manufacturing costs(0.3)%Fiscal year ended June 30, 201160.3 %Revenue volume of products and service(0.3)%Mix of products and services sold(0.7)%Manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies0.2 %Other service and manufacturing costs(1.4)%Fiscal year ended June 30, 201258.1 %Changes in gross margin percentage driven by revenue volume reflect our ability to leverage existing infrastructure to generate higher revenues. It also includes the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, average customer pricing and customer revenue deferrals associated with volume purchase agreements. Changes in gross margin percentage from mix of products and services sold reflect the impact of changes in the composition within product and service offerings. Changes in gross margin percentage from manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies reflect our ability to manage costs and drive productivity as we scale our manufacturing activity to respond to customer requirements; this includes the impact of capacity utilization, use of overtime and variability of cost structure. Changes in gross margin percentage from other service and manufacturing costs include the impact of customer support costs, including the efficiencies with which we deliver services to our customers, and the effectiveness with which we manage our production plans and inventory risk.Our gross margin decreased to 58.1% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 from 60.3% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 primarily due to less favorable mix of products and services sold, an increase in revenue deferrals associated with volume purchase agreements and an increase in inventory reserves related to product transitions.Our gross margin percentage increased to 60.3% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 from 55.2% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 primarily due to increased demand and revenue from the sale of advanced technology defect inspection and metrology products.Engineering, Research and Development (R&D) Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)2012 2011 2010 FY12 vs. FY11 FY11 vs. FY10R&D expenses$452,937 $386,163 $329,560 $66,774 17% $56,603 17%R&D expenses as a percentage of total revenues14% 12% 18% 2% (6)% R&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, primarily due to an increase in employee related expenses of $24.8 million as a result of annual compensation adjustments and additional engineering headcount, an increase in engineering material costs of $20.3 million for program development related to our next generation defect inspection products, a decrease in external R&D funding of $11.9 million and an increase in depreciation expense of $5.3 million. 41Table of ContentsR&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, primarily due to an increase in employee related expenses of $27.8 million as a result of additional engineering headcount and higher variable compensation, an increase in engineering material costs of $24.2 million for program development related to our next generation defect inspection products and an increase in external services of $9.7 million to support expanded R&D activities, partially offset by an increase of $5.1 million in benefit to R&D expense from external funding.R&D expenses include the benefit of $6.9 million, $18.8 million and $13.7 million of external funding received during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, for certain strategic development programs, primarily from government grants. We expect our R&D expenses to increase with higher levels of business activity as we accelerate our investments in critical programs focusing on new technologies and enhancements to existing products.Our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace. To do this, we believe that we must continue to make substantial investments in our research and development. We remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the yield challenges our customers face at future technology nodes.Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)2012 2011 2010 FY12 vs. FY11 FY11 vs. FY10SG&A expenses$372,666 $369,431 $361,372 $3,235 1% $8,059 2%SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues12% 12% 20% % (8)% SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 were higher compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, primarily due to a decrease in bad debt recovery of $10.7 million, an increase in expenses related to infrastructure of $5.8 million to support current and anticipated business activities and an increase in consulting expenses of $3.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in legal expenses of $8.8 million, reflecting the resolution of certain litigation matters during the three months ended March 31, 2012, and a decrease in employee related expenses of $8.2 million as a result of lower variable compensation. SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 were higher compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, primarily due to increases in employee related expenses of $37.0 million as a result of additional headcount to support higher sales volume and higher variable compensation, partially offset by a decrease in asset impairment charges of $13.4 million, a decrease in legal expenses of $9.1 million related to our historical stock option practices and certain indemnification obligations, and an increase in bad debt recovery of $6.7 million.Interest Income and Other, Net and Interest Expense Year ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)2012 2011 2010Interest income and other, net$11,966 $4,064 $31,532Interest expense$54,197 $54,328 $54,517Interest income and other, net as a percentage of total revenues% % 2%Interest expense as a percentage of total revenues2% 2% 3%Interest income and other, net is comprised primarily of interest income earned on our investment and cash portfolio, realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities, gains or losses from revaluation of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities as well as foreign currency contracts, impairments associated with equity investments in privately held companies, and interest related accruals (such as interest and penalty accruals related to our tax obligations). The increase in interest income and other, net during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 was primarily attributable to a decrease in impairment charges of $6.9 million for equity investments in privately held companies and a decrease of $4.1 million in interest and penalty accruals related to uncertain tax positions. 42Table of ContentsThe decrease in interest income and other, net during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 was primarily attributable to an increase in impairment charges of $6.8 million for equity investments in privately held companies and an international tax reserve benefit of $15.9 million due to the expiration of a statute of limitations relating to an uncertainty in our position with respect to a foreign transaction based tax during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 compared to no tax reserve benefit during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. Interest expense is primarily attributable to the $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior fixed rate notes that we issued in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008.Provision for Income TaxesThe following table provides details of income taxes: (Dollar amounts in thousands)Year ended June 30, 2012 2011 2010Income before income taxes$974,094 $1,110,066 $291,181Provision for income taxes$218,079 $315,578 $78,881Effective tax rate22.4% 28.4% 27.1%The provision for income taxes differs from the statutory U.S. federal rate primarily due to foreign income with lower tax rates and tax credits, offset by state taxes, the tax effects of employee stock activity and other factors. Tax expense as a percentage of income during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 was 22.4% compared to 28.4% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. Tax expense decreased primarily from a decrease in state tax expense, a decrease in tax reserves, and an increase in the percentage of our revenues that were earned outside the U.S. in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. Tax expense as a percentage of income during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 was 28.4% compared to 27.1% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. Tax expense increased primarily from an increase in state tax expense, a decrease in the percentage of our revenues that were earned outside the U.S. in jurisdictions with lower tax rates, and an increase in tax reserves, offset by a decrease in the effect of shortfalls from employee stock activity.Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre tax income, the amount of our pre tax income as business activities fluctuate, non deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions, research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pre tax income, the domestic manufacturing deduction, non taxable or non deductible increases or decreases in the assets held within our Executive Deferred Savings Plan, the tax effects of employee stock activity and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies.We incurred $11.9 million and $15.2 million in additional tax expense during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, due to shortfalls from employee stock activity. Windfall tax benefits arise when a companys tax deduction for employee stock activity exceeds book compensation for the same activity. A shortfall arises when the tax deduction is less than book compensation. Windfalls are recorded as increases to capital in excess of par value. Shortfalls are recorded as decreases to capital in excess of par value to the extent that cumulative windfalls exceed cumulative shortfalls. Shortfalls in excess of cumulative windfalls are recorded as provision for income taxes. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013, cumulative shortfalls from employee stock activity may continue to exceed cumulative windfalls from employee stock activity, and we may therefore report higher provision for income taxes as a result. Because we cannot determine all of the factors that will enter into our income tax expense computation for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013, we cannot currently estimate this impact on our tax rate for the next fiscal year.In the normal course of business, we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.43Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital Resources As of June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)2012 2011 2010Cash and cash equivalents$751,294 $711,329 $529,918Marketable securities1,783,150 1,327,206 1,004,126Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$2,534,444 $2,038,535 $1,534,044Percentage of total assets50% 44% 39% Year ended June 30,(In thousands)2012 2011 2010Net cash provided by operating activities$941,617 $823,166 $447,800Net cash used in investing activities(528,891) (359,510) (227,964)Net cash used in financing activities(364,103) (300,155) (216,331)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents(8,658) 17,910 1,446Net increase in cash and cash equivalents$39,965 $181,411 $4,951As of June 30, 2012, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2.5 billion, which is an increase of $496 million from June 30, 2011. As of June 30, 2012, $888 million of our $2.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. We currently intend to permanently reinvest approximately $673 million of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries. If, however, a portion of these funds were to be needed for our operations in the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. and foreign taxes of approximately 30% 50% of the funds repatriated. The amount of taxes due will depend on the amount and manner of the repatriation, as well as the location from where the funds are repatriated. We have accrued (but have not paid) U.S. taxes on the remaining cash of $215 million of the $888 million held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. As such, these funds can be returned to the U.S. without accruing any additional U.S. tax expense. The total amount of dividends paid during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $234 million, $167 million and $102 million, respectively. The increase in the total amount of dividends paid during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 compared to the preceding fiscal years reflected an increase during the quarter ended September 30, 2011 to the level of our quarterly dividend from $0.25 to $0.35 per share. On July 10, 2012, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a further increase in the level of our quarterly dividend from $0.35 to $0.40 per share.The shares repurchased under our stock repurchase program have decreased our basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding. The decrease was partially offset by additional shares issued upon the exercise of employee stock options and the vesting of employee restricted stock units and in connection with stock purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. In October 2008, we suspended our stock repurchase program, and we subsequently restarted the program in February 2010.We have historically financed our liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations. 44Table of ContentsFiscal Year 2012 Compared to Fiscal Year 2011Net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 from $823 million to $942 million primarily as a result of the following key factors:A decrease in tax payments of approximately $240 million, which includes a tax refund of $40 million and a change in the timing of when revenue is recognized for federal income tax purposes, resulting in lower tax payments during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. We expect that tax payments in future periods will increase to normal amounts relative to our profit before taxes. This decrease in tax payments was partially offset byA decrease in cash collections of approximately $65 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 andAn increase in payroll expenses of approximately $95 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, mainly due to increases in employee headcount.Net cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 from $360 million to $529 million, primarily as a result of an increase in the use of cash for purchases of available for sale and trading securities, net of sales and maturities, of approximately $147 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011.Net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 from $300 million to $364 million, primarily as a result of the following key factors:An increase in dividend payments of $66 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, mainly due to an increase in the quarterly dividend payout amount that we announced in July 2011, andAn increase in common stock repurchases of $29 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, partially offset byAn increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $39 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. Fiscal Year 2011 Compared to Fiscal Year 2010Net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 from $448 million to $823 million, primarily as a result of the following key factors:An increase in cash collections of approximately $1.4 billion during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, due to higher sales volume, partially offset byAn increase in vendor payments of approximately $580 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, to support a higher level of business activities,An increase in payroll expenses of approximately $170 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, mainly due to bonus payments for fiscal year 2010 (which were paid during fiscal year 2011) and higher headcount, andAn increase in tax payments of approximately $270 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, due to higher profitability.Net cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 from $228 million to $360 million, primarily as a result of an increase in the use of cash for purchases of available for sale and trading securities, net of sales and maturities, of approximately $124 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010.45Table of ContentsNet cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 from $216 million to $300 million, primarily as a result of the following key factors:An increase in dividend payments of $65 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, mainly due to an increase in the quarterly dividend payout amount that we announced in July 2010, andAn increase in common stock repurchases of $99 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, mainly due to the temporary suspension of our stock repurchase program from October 2008 to February 2010 due to market conditions, partially offset byAn increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $89 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010.Contractual ObligationsThe following is a schedule summarizing our significant obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of June 30, 2012: Fiscal year ending June 30,(In thousands)Total 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 and thereafter OtherLong term debt obligations(1)$750,000 $ $ $ $ $ $750,000 $Interest expense associated with long term debt obligations301,875 51,750 51,750 51,750 51,750 51,750 43,125 Purchase commitments308,209 296,455 7,777 3,970 7 Non current income tax payable(2)55,430 55,430Operating leases24,400 8,537 5,618 2,998 2,748 2,314 2,185 Pension obligations31,126 2,473 2,014 3,040 2,466 2,736 18,397 Total contractual cash obligations$1,471,040 $359,215 $67,159 $61,758 $56,971 $56,800 $813,707 $55,430 (1)In April 2008, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in 2018.(2)Represents the non current income tax payable obligation and related accrued interest. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.We have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse. In addition, from time to time we will discount, without recourse, letters of credit (LCs) received from customers in payment for goods.The following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of LCs for the indicated periods: Year ended June 30,(In thousands)2012 2011 2010Receivables sold under factoring agreements$368,894 $313,578 $107,666Proceeds from sales of LCs$30,142 $140,534 $37,226 Factoring and LC fees for the sale of certain trade receivables were recorded in interest income and other, net and were not material for the periods presented.46Table of ContentsWe maintain guarantee arrangements available through various financial institutions for up to $20.2 million, of which $18.2 million had been issued as of June 30, 2012, primarily to fund guarantees to customs authorities for value added tax (VAT) and other operating requirements of our subsidiaries in Europe and Asia. We maintain certain open inventory purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply for key components. Our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecasted time horizon can vary among different suppliers. Our open inventory purchase commitments were approximately $308 million as of June 30, 2012 and are primarily due within the next 12 months. Actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. Certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties.We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. The actual product performance and or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly. The difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited historical product performance to estimate warranty expense; more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates. Non standard warranty coverage generally includes services incremental to the standard 40 hour per week coverage for twelve months. See Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description.Working capital increased to $3.3 billion as of June 30, 2012, compared to $2.8 billion as of June 30, 2011. This increase is primarily due to higher levels of cash and marketable securities as we generated significant cash flow from operations during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, as well as higher levels of accounts receivable and inventory that resulted from supporting elevated levels of business activities, which was partially offset by cash payments relating to our stock repurchases and dividend programs. As of June 30, 2012, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $2.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business, and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months.Our credit ratings and outlooks as of July 9, 2012 are summarized below: Rating AgencyRating OutlookFitchBBB StableMoodysBaa1 StableStandard & PoorsBBB StableFactors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries, our financial position, and changes in our business strategy.47Table of ContentsOff Balance Sheet ArrangementsUnder our foreign currency risk management strategy, we utilize derivative instruments to protect our interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates. This financial exposure is monitored and managed as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. We continue our policy of hedging our current and forecasted foreign currency exposures with hedging instruments having tenors of up to 18 months (see Note 15, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description). Our outstanding hedge contracts, with maximum maturity of 18 months, were as follows: As of June 30,(In thousands)2012 2011Cash flow hedge contracts Purchase$14,689 $3,381Sell$29,362 $30,133Other foreign currency hedge contracts Purchase$121,965 $174,499Sell$126,827 $216,738Indemnification Obligations. Subject to certain limitations, we are obligated to indemnify our current and former directors, officers and employees with respect to certain litigation matters and investigations that arise in connection with their service to us. These obligations arise under the terms of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, applicable contracts, and Delaware and California law. The obligation to indemnify generally means that we are required to pay or reimburse the individuals reasonable legal expenses and possibly damages and other liabilities incurred in connection with these matters. For example, we have paid or reimbursed legal expenses incurred in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option practices and the related litigation and government inquiries by a number of our current and former directors, officers and employees. Although the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification obligations is theoretically unlimited, we believe the fair value of this liability, to the extent estimable, is appropriately considered within the reserve we have established for currently pending legal proceedings.We are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise in connection with contracts and license agreements or the sale of assets, under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from, or provide customers with other remedies to protect against, bodily injury or damage to personal property caused by our products, non compliance with our product performance specifications, infringement by our products of third party intellectual property rights and a breach of warranties, representations and covenants related to such matters as title to assets sold, validity of certain intellectual property rights, non infringement of third party rights, and certain income tax related matters. In each of these circumstances, payment by us is typically subject to the other party making a claim to and cooperating with us pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract. This usually allows us to challenge the other partys claims or, in case of breach of intellectual property representations or covenants, to control the defense or settlement of any third party claims brought against the other party. Further, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of amounts, activity (typically at our option to replace or correct the products or terminate the agreement with a refund to the other party), and duration. In some instances, we may have recourse against third parties and or insurance covering certain payments made by us. It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.48Table of ContentsITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. To mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency hedges. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of June 30, 2012. Actual results may differ materially.As of June 30, 2012, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of $1.8 billion, excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents. These securities, as with all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10% from levels as of June 30, 2012, the fair value of the portfolio would decline by $1.5 million.As of June 30, 2012, we had net forward and option contracts to sell $19.5 million in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures (detail of these contracts and hedging activities is included in Note 15, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities to the Consolidated Financial Statements). If we had entered into these contracts on June 30, 2012, the U.S. dollar equivalent would have been $20.0 million. A 10% adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by $18.4 million. However, if this occurred, the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount. Accordingly, we believe that, as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure, changes in most relevant foreign currency exchange rates should have no material impact on our income or cash flows.In April 2008, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.90% senior unsecured notes due in 2018. The fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. As of June 30, 2012, the book value and the fair value of our fixed rate debt were $746.8 million and $902.2 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2011, the book value and the fair value of our fixed rate debt were $746.3 million and $863.5 million, respectively.49Table of Contents
