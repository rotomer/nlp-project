ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Introduction This managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to provide investors with an understanding of the Corporations past performance, its financial condition and its prospects. We will discuss and provide our analysis of the following: Overview of Business and 2003 Results Overview of Business Segments Results of Operations and Related Information Liquidity and Capital Resources Variable Interest Entities Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates Contingencies and Legal Matters Business Outlook Overview of Business and 2003 Results The Corporation is a global health and hygiene company with manufacturing facilities in 38 countries and its products are sold in more than 150 countries. The Corporations products are sold under such well known brands as Kleenex, Scott, Huggies, Pull Ups, Kotex and Depend. In managing this global business, the Corporations management believes that developing new and improved products, responding effectively to competitive challenges, obtaining and maintaining leading market shares, controlling costs, and managing currency and commodity risks are important to the long term success of the Corporation. In the discussion and analysis of our results of operations and other related information we will refer to these factors. Product innovation Our past results and future prospects depend in large part on product innovation. We rely on our ability to develop and introduce new or improved products to drive sales and volume growth and to achieve and or maintain category leadership. In order to develop new or improved products, we must develop the technology to support those products. A major portion of our total research and development expenditures is directed toward new or improved personal care, tissue and health care products and nonwoven materials. Competitive environment Our past results and future prospects are significantly affected by the competitive environment in which we operate. We experience intense competition for sales of our principal products in our major markets, both domestically and internationally. Our products compete with widely advertised, well known, branded products, as well as private label products, which are typically sold at lower prices. We have several major competitors in most of our markets, some of which are larger and more diversified. The principal methods and elements of competition include brand recognition and loyalty, product innovation, quality and performance, price, and marketing and distribution capabilities. 16 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) Aggressive competitive actions by our competitors in 2002 and 2003 have required that we increase promotional spending in order to maintain our market shares. We expect our competitors to continue to be aggressive in 2004. Market shares Achieving leading market shares in our principal products has been an important part of our past performance. We hold the number 1 or 2 brand position in more than 80 countries. Achieving and maintaining leading market shares is important because of ongoing consolidation of retailers and the trend of leading merchandisers seeking to stock only the top competitive brands. We track U.S. market share on a sales dollar basis with information provided by A.C. Nielson for distribution through the food, drug and mass merchandising channels, excluding Wal Mart, warehouse clubs, dollar stores and certain other small outlets. This group does not participate in reporting market share by brand. Cost controls To maintain our competitive position, we must control our manufacturing, distribution and other costs. We have achieved cost savings from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains and distribution efficiencies in each of our business segments. Our strategic investments in our information systems should also allow further costs savings through streamlining of our administrative operations. Foreign currency and commodity risks As a multinational enterprise, we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Our ability to effectively manage these risks can have a material impact on our results of operations. During 2003, we continued to face intense competition in most of our markets. In particular, the diaper and pants categories in North America and Europe were affected by the competitive pricing and package sizing pressures that began in late 2002. In addition to lower net selling prices, our consumer tissue businesses were also adversely affected by higher materials input costs. Despite these challenges, we achieved improved results in 2003: Our net sales grew 6 percent. We continued our focus on product innovation delivering a number of new and improved products, such as Huggies Convertible diaper pants, Pull Ups training pants with easy open sides, Poise pantiliners, new Viva towels in Australia and new and improved surgical products in health care. The strength of our portfolio of leading brands helped drive double digit sales growth to our top six global customers for the third year in a row. While our operating profit decreased 2 percent, net income increased 1 percent. We delivered cost savings of about $190 million, near the upper end of our goal of $175 $200 million, which offset higher pension costs of nearly $140 million. In addition, we incurred higher costs for fiber, energy and product distribution. Other income (expense), net reflects currency losses versus gains in 2002. Net income benefited from a lower effective tax rate. We achieved record cash flow from operations for the second consecutive year. Our strong cash flow permitted us to make cash contributions to our defined benefit pension trusts of about $185 million, and we plan to contribute an additional $100 million in 2004. We repurchased 10.4 million shares of our common stock under authorized share repurchase programs at a cost of $529 million. We increased our annual cash dividend 13 percent in 2003 and will increase it an additional 18 percent in 2004. 17 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) Overview of Business Segments The Corporation is organized into operating segments based on product groupings. These operating segments have been aggregated into three reportable global business segments: Personal Care; Consumer Tissue; and Business to Business. Each reportable segment is headed by an executive officer who reports to the Chief Executive Officer and is responsible for the development and execution of global strategies to drive growth and profitability of the Corporations worldwide personal care, consumer tissue and business to business operations. These strategies include global plans for branding and product positioning, technology and research and development programs, cost reductions including supply chain management, and capacity and capital investments for each of these businesses. The principal sources of revenue in each of our global business segments are described below. The accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Personal Care segment manufactures and markets disposable diapers, training and youth pants and swimpants; feminine and incontinence care products; and related products. Products in this segment are primarily for household use and are sold under a variety of brand names, including Huggies, Pull Ups, Little Swimmers, GoodNites, Kotex, Lightdays, Depend, Poise and other brand names. The Consumer Tissue segment manufactures and markets facial and bathroom tissue, paper towels and napkins for household use; wet wipes; and related products. Products in this segment are sold under the Kleenex, Scott, Cottonelle, Viva, Andrex, Scottex, Hakle, Page, Huggies and other brand names. The Business to Business segment manufactures and markets facial and bathroom tissue, paper towels, wipers and napkins for away from home use; health care products such as surgical gowns, drapes, infection control products, sterilization wraps, disposable face masks and exam gloves, respiratory products, and other disposable medical products; printing, premium business and correspondence papers; specialty and technical papers; and other products. Products in this segment are sold under the Kimberly Clark, Kleenex, Scott, Kimwipes, WypAll, Surpass, Safeskin, Tecnol, Ballard and other brand names. 18 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) Results of Operations and Related Information In this section, we discuss and analyze our 2003 net sales, operating profit and other information relevant to an understanding of our 2003 results of operations. In this discussion and analysis, we compare our 2003 results to 2002, and our 2002 results to 2001. In each of those discussions, we focus first on our consolidated results, and then discuss the results of each of our reportable segments. Analysis of Consolidated Net Sales Three Years Ended December 31, 2003 By Business Segment 2003 2002 2001 (Millions of dollars) Personal Care $ 5,257.5 $ 5,101.7 $ 5,156.6 Consumer Tissue 5,441.9 5,018.6 4,747.9 Business to Business 3,800.8 3,593.0 3,544.6 Intersegment sales (152.2 ) (147.0 ) (161.5 ) Consolidated $ 14,348.0 $ 13,566.3 $ 13,287.6 By Geographic Area 2003 2002 2001 (Millions of dollars) United States $ 8,657.6 $ 8,649.4 $ 8,638.3 Canada 801.8 831.4 900.7 Intergeographic sales (515.6 ) (601.2 ) (694.7 ) Total North America 8,943.8 8,879.6 8,844.3 Europe 2,892.5 2,482.8 2,341.3 Asia, Latin America and other 3,061.6 2,751.5 2,661.7 Intergeographic sales (549.9 ) (547.6 ) (559.7 ) Consolidated $ 14,348.0 $ 13,566.3 $ 13,287.6 Commentary: 2003 versus 2002 Percent Change in Sales Versus Prior Year TotalChange Change Due To Volume TotalVolume OrganicGrowth Acquisitions NetPrice Currency Other Consolidated 6 2 1 1 4 Personal Care 3 3 Consumer Tissue 8 4 2 2 5 (1) Business to Business 6 3 3 (1) 4 Consolidated net sales increased 5.8 percent over 2002. In addition to favorable currency effects of about 4 percent, higher sales volumes of more than 2 percent more than offset slightly lower net selling prices. The favorable currency effects, primarily in Europe and Australia, were tempered by unfavorable currency effects in 19 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) Latin America. Slightly less than one half of the increased sales volumes were due to the consolidation, in August 2003, of Klabin Kimberly S.A., (Klabin), the Corporations former equity affiliate Brazils largest tissue manufacturer, and the February 2003 acquisition of the Klucze tissue business in Poland. Market Shares Shown below are our U.S. market shares for key categories for full years 2001 through 2003: Category 2003 2002 2001 Diapers 38 % 40 % 39 % Training, Youth and Swim Pants 68 % 73 % 79 % Adult Incontinence Care 56 % 55 % 54 % Facial Tissue 53 % 54 % 53 % Bathroom Tissue 28 % 27 % 26 % Paper Towels 19 % 19 % 17 % Worldwide sales of personal care products increased 3.1 percent due to favorable currency exchange rates. Overall sales volumes and net selling prices were the same as last year. In North America, net sales increased about 1 percent. Favorable Canadian exchange rate effects and product mix more than offset lower net selling prices of about 1 percent. Increased sales volumes for training pants and incontinence care products were offset by decreased sales volume for diapers that were affected by aggressive competitive actions. Training pants products achieved an all time record for annual shipments even though U.S. market share for 2003 was below last years full year share. Recent trends are more positive with fourth quarter market share recovering to about 70 percent, a gain of approximately 4 points compared with the fourth quarter of 2002. While U.S. diaper market share for the full year was less than the prior year, market share for the most recent 12 week period improved sequentially and versus the prior year. Net sales in Europe increased about 10 percent as favorable currency effects more than offset 4 percent lower sales volumes due to aggressive competitive consumer promotion activity. Lower diaper sales volumes were partially offset by increased sales volumes for incontinence care products and training pants. In Latin America, net sales declined about 9 percent. Net selling prices increased more than 5 percent but were more than offset by lower sales volumes, primarily in the Caribbean region, largely because of weak economic conditions in the Dominican Republic and unfavorable currency effects in Brazil and Venezuela. Net sales in Asia increased nearly 12 percent driven by favorable currency effects and higher sales volumes in Australia. Worldwide sales of consumer tissue products increased 8.4 percent due to favorable currency effects, primarily in Europe and nearly 4 percent higher sales volumes. Overall net selling prices were essentially even with last year. In North America, net sales increased more than 1 percent on 2 percent higher sales volumes partially offset by lower net selling prices. In the paper towel category, U.S. market share in the fourth quarter was above the average for the year and up 2 points versus 2002. While our overall U.S. market share in the facial category for 2003 was below 2002, there was sequential improvement in both the third and fourth quarters of the year. Net sales in Europe increased more than 20 percent driven by favorable currency effects and higher sales volumes of about 5 percent, primarily due to the Klucze acquisition. Net selling prices were flat versus 2002. In Latin America, net sales advanced more than 20 percent primarily as a result of the consolidation of Klabin. Net sales in Asia increased more than 7 percent primarily due to favorable currency effects in Australia, partially offset by lower sales volumes in the region. 20 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) Worldwide sales of products in the business to business segment increased 5.8 percent as a result of favorable currency effects and nearly 3 percent higher sales volumes, tempered by net selling prices that were more than 1 percent lower. The higher sales volumes were driven by advances for professional products in North America, Latin America and Asia and increased sales volumes of global health care products. 2002 versus 2001 Percent Change in Sales Versus Prior Year TotalChange Change Due To Volume NetPrice Currency Other TotalVolume OrganicGrowth Acquisitions Consolidated 2 5 4 1 (2) (1) Personal Care (1) 4 2 2 (1) (3) (1) Consumer Tissue 6 8 6 2 (3) 1 Business to Business 1 3 2 1 (2) Consolidated net sales increased 2.1 percent over 2001. Unfavorable currency effects reduced net sales about 1 percent. These unfavorable currency effects, primarily in Argentina and Venezuela, were partially offset by favorable currency effects in Europe. Sales volumes increased approximately 5 percent, including the acquisition of majority ownership of Kimberly Clark Australia Pty. Ltd. (KCA) effective July 1, 2001, which contributed about one third of the gain. Net selling prices decreased about 2 percent, primarily due to higher promotional spending in North America in the personal care and consumer tissue segments. Worldwide sales of personal care products declined 1.1 percent. Sales volume growth of over 3 percent, about one half of which was due to the consolidation of KCA, was more than offset by lower net selling prices and negative effects of changes in currency exchange rates. In North America, net sales decreased about 2 percent as lower net selling prices, driven by competitive activities, more than offset sales volume gains of nearly 4 percent. Net sales in Europe increased about 4 percent, primarily due to favorable currency effects. Decreased net selling prices overcame 1 percent higher sales volumes. In Latin America, net sales declined primarily because of the effects of the recession in Argentina. KCA was a significant contributor to higher sales volumes in Asia, along with growth in sales of infant and feminine care products in Korea, partially offset by lower sales volumes in the Philippines. Worldwide sales of consumer tissue products increased 5.7 percent. Net sales grew on the strength of 8 percent higher sales volumes and favorable currency effects, tempered by 3 percent lower net selling prices. In North America, a 5 percent increase in net sales was driven by more than 9 percent growth in sales volumes, with strong increases in sales of Scott towels and Cottonelle and Scott bathroom tissue, partially offset by lower net selling prices, including the effect of higher promotion spending. Net sales in Europe increased more than 7 percent including a near 5 percent boost from currency effects. Higher sales volumes of over 3 percent, including the launch of baby wipes, were partially offset by lower net selling prices. In Latin America, the unfavorable currency effects not recovered through selling price increases partially reduced the overall increase in sales volumes. In addition to the contribution of KCA, Asia benefited from higher sales volumes in Korea, tempered by market weakness in Taiwan. Worldwide sales of products in the business to business segment increased 1.4 percent. Sales volumes for the segment increased nearly 3 percent, on the strength of higher volumes in the health care and professional businesses of 7 percent and 4 percent, respectively. However, net sales in the North American printing and technical paper businesses declined due to the effects of the weak U.S. economy. 21 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) Analysis of Consolidated Operating Profit Three Years Ended December 31, 2003 By Business Segment 2003 2002 2001 (Millions of dollars) Personal Care $ 1,104.9 $ 1,042.7 $ 1,042.7 Consumer Tissue 844.3 921.7 863.7 Business to Business 683.0 670.0 599.4 Other income (expense), net (111.9 ) (73.3 ) (83.7 ) Unallocated net (107.9 ) (97.3 ) (83.9 ) Consolidated $ 2,412.4 $ 2,463.8 $ 2,338.2 By Geographic Area 2003 2002 2001 (Millions of dollars) United States $ 1,942.9 $ 2,018.9 $ 1,927.5 Canada 131.7 100.5 156.9 Europe 202.9 191.0 176.2 Asia, Latin America and other 354.7 324.0 245.2 Other income (expense), net (111.9 ) (73.3 ) (83.7 ) Unallocated net (107.9 ) (97.3 ) (83.9 ) Consolidated $ 2,412.4 $ 2,463.8 $ 2,338.2 Note: Unallocated net consists of expenses not associated with the business segments or geographic areas.

Consolidated operating profit decreased 2.1 percent due to higher promotional spending, increased fiber, distribution and energy costs, increased pension expense of approximately $140 million and a higher level of expenses in other income (expense), net that more than offset the benefits of cost reduction programs of about $190 million, favorable currency effects and increased sales volumes. Each of the three business segments incurred more than $40 million of the higher pension costs. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales decreased from 18.2 percent in 2002 to 16.8 percent in 2003. Operating profit for personal care products increased 6.0 percent primarily because the benefits of cost reduction programs and favorable currency effects more than offset the lower net selling prices, lower 22 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) sales volumes and higher raw materials and distribution costs. Although the competitive environment remained intense through product pricing and promotional activity, North America achieved strong fourth quarter results compared with the high level of incremental promotional spending in the year ago quarter associated with diaper and training pant count changes at that time. North American operating profit for the full year increased because the aggressive cost reduction efforts more than offset lower net selling prices and the higher pension costs. Operating profit in Europe advanced as cost savings programs and favorable currency effects more than offset lower sales volumes. In Latin America, operating profit declined due to higher materials and fiber costs and unfavorable currency effects. Operating profit in Asia rose primarily due to higher sales volumes and favorable currency effects in Australia. Operating profit for consumer tissue products decreased 8.4 percent because increased sales volumes and cost reductions were more than offset by higher fiber, distribution and energy costs, the higher pension costs and increased promotional spending. In each of the major regions North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia operating profit declined generally due to the same factors that affected the segment overall. Operating profit for the business to business segment increased 1.9 percent as the benefits of cost savings programs, higher sales volumes and favorable currency effects more than offset lower net selling prices, higher fiber and other materials costs, higher distribution and energy expenses, and the increased pension costs. Operating profit for professional products rose in both North America and Europe primarily due to cost reductions and favorable currency effects. Operating profit for health care products increased because of higher sales volumes, cost savings and favorable currency effects, tempered by lower net selling prices. Operating profit for other businesses in the segment declined due to lower sales volumes and higher fiber costs. In 2002, the Corporation recorded charges of approximately $44 million related to business improvement and other programs. Charges related to the plans to streamline manufacturing and administrative operations in Latin America and Europe totaled $14.3 million and $19.1 million, respectively, and consisted principally of employee severance of $16.8 million and asset write off and disposal costs of $8.4 million. The Corporation also recorded charges of approximately $4 million for employee severance to complete actions that had been initiated in 2001 and approximately $4 million for a one time national security tax levied on all corporations in Colombia. The above 2002 charges were recorded in the business segments as follows: personal care $14.8 million; consumer tissue $21.8 million; business to business $7.6 million. On a geographic basis, these charges are included as follows: North America $6.8 million; Europe $19.1 million; Asia, Latin America and other $18.3 million. These charges are included in the consolidated income statement as follows: cost of products sold $19.9 million, consisting principally of employee severance and asset write off costs; marketing, research and general expenses $24.3 million, consisting principally of severance, training and other integration costs in Europe. Other income (expense), net in 2003 included charges of $34 million consisting of $15.6 million for a legal judgment in Europe and $18.4 million for the costs associated with the redemption of $200 million of 7 7/8% and $200 million of 7.0% debentures, and nearly $20 million for charges to write off an investment in an historic restoration project and to record the cost of exiting a nonstrategic facility outside of North America. Also included were $25.1 million of operating losses related to the Corporations participation in affordable housing and historic renovation projects, an increase of $8.0 million compared with 2002. Included in 2002 were $21 million of charges related to the settlement in December 2002 of securities and shareholder derivative litigation involving Safeskin 23 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) Corporation (Safeskin) and a charge of $26.5 million for the write off of tax credits in Brazil. The litigation predated the Corporations February 2000 acquisition of Safeskin.

Consolidated operating profit increased 5.4 percent. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales increased from 17.6 percent in 2001 to 18.2 percent in 2002. In 2002, the Corporation incurred higher net pension costs for its defined benefit plans of approximately $52 million compared with 2001. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, the Corporation ceased amortizing goodwill in 2002. Goodwill amortization by segment in 2001 was: personal care $16.0 million; consumer tissue $14.6 million and business to business $58.8 million. By geographic region, goodwill amortization in 2001 was: North America $57.8 million; Europe $9.2 million and Asia, Latin America and other $22.4 million. Operating profit for personal care products was even with 2001. The costs of promotional spending that were driven by competitive activity, especially in the second half of the year, offset the increased sales volumes, lower costs for business improvement plans and the discontinuation of goodwill amortization in 2002. In North America, operating profit declined despite increased sales volumes, particularly for Depend and Poise adult incontinence care products, and increased productivity and cost savings programs. This decline primarily reflected the high levels of promotional activity to defend the infant and child care brands market positions. While operating profit in Europe improved, in part due to lower raw material costs, that business experienced competitive pressure similar to North America. Operating profit in Asia benefited from the acquisition of KCA and growth in Korea, tempered by lower earnings in the Philippines. Operating profit for consumer tissue products increased 6.7 percent. Increased sales volumes, particularly in North America for Scott and Cottonelle bathroom tissue and Scott towels, and lower pulp costs were the primary drivers behind this growth. These gains were partially offset by increased levels of promotional and marketing spending. Operating profit for the business to business segment increased 11.8 percent. In 2001, operating profit included a charge of $58.8 million for goodwill amortization. In addition, the segment recorded approximately $51 million of costs in 2001 primarily related to a North American mill closing and costs to integrate acquired businesses compared to about $8 million of similar costs in 2002. While earnings for the health care business benefited from the higher sales volumes, this gain was offset by lower results in the other businesses due to the economic slowdown in North America. 24 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) Operating profit in 2001 included charges totaling nearly $167 million, principally for asset write off and disposal costs of $107 million, employee severance costs of $26 million, contract termination costs of $15 million and costs to assimilate acquired businesses of $13 million. In November 2001, the Corporation announced plans for the streamlining of manufacturing operations in Latin America, including the shutdown of four small, older plants, as well as the closure of a technical paper mill in North America. Total cash charges for these plans were $18.4 million, including a one time $11 million payment to settle a vendor contract agreement in North America. Noncash costs for these plans recorded in the fourth quarter totaled $66.7 million, including the write off of the assets associated with the technical paper mill that was closed in December 2001. Also included in those plans was the write off of excess manufacturing equipment in North America of approximately $14 million. These plans were substantially completed prior to the end of 2002. Also included in the $167 million of charges were workforce severance costs of about $6 million and asset write off and disposal costs of approximately $34 million to streamline personal care operations in North America and China. These programs were completed during 2001. As part of the integration of acquired businesses, including Linostar, S.p.A. (Linostar) in Italy, S K Corporation (S K) in Taiwan, and Safeskin, costs totaling approximately $13 million related to assimilating these operations, such as changing packaging and labeling and duplicative labor costs, were expensed as incurred. The above charges were recorded in the business segments as follows: personal care $76.8 million; consumer tissue $39.2 million; business to business $51.4 million. On a geographic basis these charges are included as follows: North America $109.5 million; Europe $12.6 million; Asia, Latin America and other $45.3 million. These charges are included in the consolidated income statement as follows: cost of products sold $141.7 million, consisting principally of asset write off and disposal costs and severance costs; marketing, research and general expenses $25.7 million, consisting principally of severance costs for administrative employees in Europe and certain costs related to the business integrations. Other income (expense), net included the Safeskin litigation settlement in 2002 and $17.1 million of operating losses related to the Corporations participation in affordable housing and historic renovation real estate projects, an increase of $11.8 million compared with 2001. In 2001 a charge of $43.2 million was recorded pursuant to arbitration rulings released on January 21 and 31, 2002. The rulings resolved two disputes related to the closure of the Corporations Mobile, Ala., pulp mill in 1999 and the supply of energy to the Corporations Mobile tissue mill. Also included were currency transaction gains in 2002 compared with losses in 2001. In addition, included in 2002 and 2001 were charges of $26.5 million and $33 million, respectively, for the write off of tax credits in Brazil when it was determined that the credits could not be utilized to offset taxes otherwise payable. From 1999 through early 2001, two of our affiliates in Brazil purchased unused tax credits, as permitted by law, to reduce taxes otherwise payable. During the fourth quarter 2001, we determined that it was probable that a portion of the purchased tax credits would not be allowed by tax authorities nor would collection of the collateral or amounts pledged under sellers guarantees occur. Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded a charge of $33 million to other expense for these tax credits. In 2002, we established a team to investigate and to pursue actions to recover these losses. In the second quarter of 2002, evidence was discovered to suggest fraud by at least one employee of our affiliates and possibly several others in connection with the tax credit purchases. We determined that the remaining purchased tax credits were invalid and that the collateral backing them was worthless. We had previously concluded, during the December 2001 review, based on the advice of our outside advisors that these credits represented legitimate tax credits. Accordingly, in the second quarter of 2002, we recorded a charge of $26.5 million to other expense for losses associated with these tax credits. We have no remaining financial exposure for purchased tax credits. We have implemented various corrective actions to prevent this matter from recurring in the future, including terminating all the employees responsible for the decisions to purchase these tax credits. 25 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) We have also filed civil and criminal actions against a former employee; third parties (i.e., intermediaries who sold or arranged for our affiliates purchase of tax credits); tax credit sellers; and legal counsel associated with the purchase of the tax credits. In addition, we have restricted the affiliates purchasing authority and control procedures have been re emphasized. Personnel changes have been made to strengthen the affiliates organizations and their internal control compliance. Additional Income Statement Commentary Synthetic Fuel Partnership In April 2003, the Corporation entered into an agreement whereby it acquired a 49.5 percent minority interest in a synthetic fuel partnership. The partnership is a variable interest entity that will become subject to the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation FIN 46 (Revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB 51, (FIN 46R) as of March 31, 2004. The transaction was subject to the receipt of a favorable private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) confirming that the synthetic fuel produced by the partnership is eligible for synthetic fuel tax credits. The partnership received the favorable letter ruling on October 31, 2003. The partnerships test procedures are in compliance with the requirements outlined by the IRS. These tax credits are not available for synthetic fuel produced after 2007. The production of synthetic fuel results in pretax losses. In 2003, these pretax losses totaled $105.5 million and are reported as nonoperating expense on the Corporations income statement. The production of synthetic fuel results in tax credits as well as tax deductions for the nonoperating losses, which reduce the Corporations income tax expense. In 2003, the Corporations participation in the synthetic fuel partnership resulted in $94.1 million of tax credits, and the nonoperating losses generated an additional $37.2 million of tax benefits, which combined to reduce the Corporations income tax provision by $131.3 million. The tax benefits and credits related to the operation of the partnership increased net income by $25.8 million or $.05 per share. The tax credits are shown as a reconciling item in the Corporations reconciliation of the U.S. statutory rate to its effective income tax rate in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Because the partnership has received the favorable private letter ruling from the IRS and because the partnerships test procedures conform to IRS procedures, the Corporation believes its loss exposure under the synthetic fuel partnership is minimal. Application of FIN 46R to this entity is not expected to have a material effect on the Corporations consolidated financial statements. 2003 versus 2002 Interest expense decreased primarily due to lower interest rates partially offset by a higher average level of debt. The Corporations effective income tax rate was 23.8 percent in 2003 compared with 29.0 percent in 2002. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to the benefits from the synthetic fuel partnership described above. The Corporations share of net income of equity affiliates was $107.0 million in 2003 compared with $113.3 million in 2002. The decrease was primarily due to lower earnings at Kimberly Clark de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. (KCM) primarily because of depreciation in the value of the peso. KCMs operating profit benefited from higher sales volumes of about 6 percent and cost savings programs. 26 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) However, these positive factors could not overcome higher fiber and other materials costs and negative currency effects. Minority owners share of subsidiaries net income decreased 4.3 percent primarily due to KCA becoming a wholly owned subsidiary on June 30, 2002. 2002 versus 2001 Interest expense decreased primarily due to lower interest rates, partially offset by a higher average level of debt. The Corporations effective income tax rate was 29.0 percent in 2002 compared with 29.8 percent in 2001. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to the discontinuance, for financial reporting purposes, of goodwill amortization that had not been deductible for income tax purposes. The Corporations share of net income of equity companies was $113.3 million in 2002 compared with $154.4 million in 2001. The decrease was primarily due to lower earnings at KCM due to negative currency effects and a higher effective tax rate due to changes in Mexican tax law. Although KCMs sales volumes increased more than 4 percent, operating profit declined about 3 percent due to lower net selling prices reflecting the competitive environment. The consolidation of KCA also impacted the Corporations share of net income of equity companies. Minority owners share of subsidiaries net income decreased 8.1 percent primarily due to a lower return on the preferred securities held by the minority interest in the Corporations consolidated foreign financing subsidiary (as described below under Financing Commentary). During 2001, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued EITF 01 9, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller of the Vendors Products. The Corporation adopted EITF 01 9 effective January 1, 2002. The adoption of EITF 01 9 did not change reported earnings for 2001 but did require the recording of a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in 2002, equal to an after tax charge of approximately $.02 per share, which resulted from a change in the period for recognizing the costs of coupons. Sales of Principal Products 2003 2002 2001 (Billions of dollars) Family care tissue products $ 4.8 $ 4.4 $ 4.2 Diapers 3.0 3.0 3.0 Away from home products 2.1 1.9 1.9 All other 4.4 4.3 4.2 Consolidated $ 14.3 $ 13.6 $ 13.3 Approximately 13 percent, 12 percent and 11 percent of net sales were to Wal Mart Stores, Inc. in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, primarily in the Personal Care and Consumer Tissue businesses. 27 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 (Millions of dollars) Cash provided by operations $ 2,613.0 $ 2,424.2 Capital spending 877.6 870.7 Acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired 258.5 410.8 Ratio of total debt and preferred securities to capital (a) 37.1 % 43.2 % Pretax interest coverage times 13.4 13.3 (a) Capital is total debt and preferred securities plus stockholders equity and minority owners interest in subsidiaries. Cash Flow Commentary: Cash provided by operations increased $188.8 million or 7.8 percent to a record $2.6 billion. The reported amounts of operating working capital are affected by changes in currency exchange rates. From a cash flow perspective, the Corporation invested less cash in operating working capital in 2003 primarily due to improved cash collections of trade accounts receivable in Europe, income tax refunds of prior year taxes and lower income tax payments. In 2003, the Corporation contributed $184.2 million to its pension plan trusts compared with $126.0 million in 2002. The significant level of cash provided by operations in 2003 allowed the Corporation to make a contribution of $50 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan in December 2003, which had originally been planned for 2004. The Corporation intends to contribute an additional $50 million to the U.S. plan and about $50 million to plans outside the U.S. in 2004. Contractual Obligations: The following table presents the Corporations total contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed or determinable. Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009+ (Millions of dollars) Contractual obligations Long term debt $ 2,919 $ 185 $ 584 $ 15 $ 322 $ 1 $ 1,812 Operating leases 249 68 53 38 25 18 47 Unconditional purchase obligations 639 230 90 44 29 28 218 Open purchase orders 986 986 Total contractual obligations $ 4,793 $ 1,469 $ 727 $ 97 $ 376 $ 47 $ 2,077 Commentary: The amounts shown in the table for long term debt are the principal balances and do not include future interest payments. The unconditional purchase obligations are for the purchase of raw materials, primarily pulp, and utilities, principally electricity. Although the Corporation is primarily liable for payments on the above operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations, based on historic operating performance and 28 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) forecasted future cash flows, management believes the Corporations exposure to losses, if any, under these arrangements is not material. The open purchase orders displayed in the table represent amounts the Corporation anticipates will become payable within the next year for goods and services the Corporation has negotiated for delivery. The table does not include anticipated payments related to the synthetic fuel partnership described above. The Corporation will only make such payments if the partnership produces synthetic fuel in future years. The Corporation estimates that it will make payments of $130 million in 2004, $100 million in both 2005 and 2006, and $60 million in 2007. A consolidated financing subsidiary of the Corporation has issued preferred securities that are in substance perpetual and are callable by the subsidiary in November 2008 and each 20 year anniversary thereafter. Management currently anticipates extending the call date of these securities in November 2008 and therefore they are not included in the above table (see Financing Commentary below for additional detail regarding these securities). Investing Commentary: The Corporation continued its focus on targeting capital spending for projects that provide operating benefits through sales growth, cost savings or product improvement. During the first quarter of 2003, the Corporation purchased the Klucze tissue business in Poland. This acquisition is consistent with the Corporations strategy of growing its global consumer tissue business and will provide it with a strong platform to expand its business in Central and Eastern Europe. The allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired was completed in 2003 and resulted in recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately $20 million. During the third quarter of 2003, the Corporation acquired an additional 49 percent interest in Kimberly Clark Peru S.A. and the remaining 50 percent interest in its tissue joint venture in Brazil (Klabin Kimberly S.A.). The cost of these acquisitions totaled approximately $200 million. These acquisitions were a result of the partners in each of the ventures exercising their options to sell their ownership interest to the Corporation. As of December 31, 2003, the preliminary allocation of the purchase price resulted in approximately $150 million of goodwill being recorded on these acquisitions. The allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired is currently in process and will be completed by the second quarter of 2004. The net increase in time deposits was primarily attributable to investment of cash accumulated in Korea. 29 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) Financing Commentary: The following table contains information for shares repurchased as part of publicly announced share repurchase programs (in millions, except per share amounts). All share repurchases by the Corporation were made through brokers on the New York Stock Exchange. No shares were repurchased directly from any officer or director of the Corporation.

(2) Repurchase of 20 million additional shares was authorized by the Corporations board of directors in February 2003. In addition, during 2002 and 2003, .1 million shares at a cost of $8.1 million and .2 million shares at a cost of $8.4 million, respectively, were purchased in connection with the exercise of employee stock options. In February 2001, the Corporation formed a Luxembourg based financing subsidiary. The subsidiary issued 1 million shares of voting preferred securities with an aggregate par value of $520 million to a nonaffiliated entity for cash proceeds of $516.5 million. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. At December 31, 2003, total debt and preferred securities was $4.2 billion, a decrease of $.3 billion from the prior year end. At December 31, 2003, the Corporation had $1.22 billion of revolving credit facilities. These facilities, unused at December 31, 2003, permit borrowing at competitive interest rates and are available for general corporate purposes, including backup for commercial paper borrowings. The Corporation pays commitment fees on the unused portion but may cancel the facilities without penalty at any time prior to their expiration. Of these facilities, $610 million expires in October 2004 and the balance expires in November 2008. In July 2003, Standard & Poors (S&P) revised the Corporations credit rating for long term debt from AA to AA . Moodys Investor Service maintained its short and long term ratings but changed the Corporations outlook to negative from stable, indicating that a ratings downgrade could be possible within the next 12 months. These changes were primarily based on the Corporations business performance in the heightened competitive environment and because S&P changed the way in which it evaluates liabilities for pensions and other postretirement benefits. Management believes that these 30 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) actions will not have a material adverse effect on the Corporations access to credit or its borrowing costs since these credit ratings remain strong and are in the top eight percent of companies listed in S&Ps ranking of the 500 largest companies. The Corporations commercial paper continues to be rated in the top category. In June 2003, the Corporation filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue up to $1.5 billion in long term debt securities. In August 2003, the Corporation issued $500 million of 5.0% Notes due August 15, 2013. The proceeds were used to redeem other notes, as described below, and retire commercial paper. In connection with the borrowing, the Corporation entered into an interest rate swap agreement maturing on August 15, 2013 with a counterparty under which the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on a $300 million notional amount is exchanged on a quarterly basis. The floating rate is 3 month average LIBOR plus 4.4 basis points. The swap agreement will permit the Corporation to maintain its desired ratio of fixed and floating rate borrowings. During June and July 2003, the Corporation issued redemption notices on $200 million of 7 7/8% and $200 million of 7.0% debentures, respectively. The costs associated with redeeming the debentures, totaling $18.4 million, were recorded in the third quarter of 2003. Also in the third quarter of 2003, the Corporation terminated a $400 million fixed to floating interest rate swap it had entered into in March 2002 in connection with the issuance of $400 million of 4 1/2% Notes maturing in July 2005. The gain on the terminated swap will be amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the debt issue. In August 2003, the Corporation repurchased $45 million of industrial revenue bonds. On December 29, 2003, the Corporation announced the repurchase of $40 million of industrial revenue development bonds to be effective February 2, 2004. At December 31, 2003, the Corporation classified the $40 million as debt payable within one year and reduced long term debt by that same amount. Management believes that the Corporations ability to generate cash from operations, which has grown from $2.3 billion in 2001 to $2.6 billion in 2003, and its capacity to issue short term and long term debt are adequate to fund working capital, capital spending and other needs in the foreseeable future. Variable Interest Entities The Corporation has variable interests in the following financing and real estate entities and a synthetic fuel partnership (see Synthetic Fuel Partnership). Financing Entities The Corporation holds a significant variable interest in two financing entities that were used to monetize long term notes received from the sale of certain nonstrategic timberlands and related assets, which were sold in 1999 and 1989 to nonaffiliated buyers. These transactions qualified for the installment method of accounting for income tax purposes and met the criteria for immediate profit recognition for financial reporting purposes contained in SFAS 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate. These sales involved notes receivable with an aggregate face value of $617 million and a fair value of approximately $593 million at the date of sale. The notes receivable are backed by irrevocable standby letters of credit issued by money center banks, which aggregated $617 million at December 31, 2003. Because the Corporation desired to monetize the $617 million of notes receivable and continue the deferral of current income taxes on the gains, in 1999 the Corporation transferred the notes received from the 1999 sale to a noncontrolled financing entity, and in 2000 it transferred the notes received from the 1989 sale to another 31 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) noncontrolled financing entity. The Corporation has minority voting interests in each of the financing entities (collectively, the Financing Entities). The transfers of the notes and certain other assets to the Financing Entities were made at fair value, were accounted for as asset sales and resulted in no gain or loss. In conjunction with the transfer of the notes and other assets, the Financing Entities became obligated for $617 million in third party debt financing. A nonaffiliated financial institution has made substantive capital investments in each of the Financing Entities, has majority voting control over them and has substantive risks and rewards of ownership of the assets in the Financing Entities. The Corporation also contributed intercompany notes receivable aggregating $662 million and intercompany preferred stock of $50 million to the Financing Entities, which serve as secondary collateral for the third party lending arrangements. In the unlikely event of default by both of the money center banks that provided the irrevocable standby letters of credit, the Corporation could experience a maximum loss of $617 million under these arrangements. The Corporation has not consolidated the Financing Entities because it is not the primary beneficiary of either entity. Rather, it will continue to account for its ownership interests in these entities using the equity method of accounting. The Corporation retains equity interests in the Financing Entities for which the legal right of offset exists against the intercompany notes. As a result, the intercompany notes payable have been offset against the Corporations equity interests in the Financing Entities for financial reporting purposes. See Financing Commentary above for a description of the Corporations Luxembourg based financing subsidiary, which is consolidated because the Corporation is the primary beneficiary of the entity. Real Estate Entities The Corporation holds a significant variable interest in certain real estate entities that will become subject to the requirements of FIN 46R as of March 31, 2004. Following is a description of these real estate entities. In 1994, the Corporation began participating in the U.S. affordable and historic renovation real estate markets. Investments in these markets are encouraged by laws enacted by the United States Congress and related federal income tax rules and regulations. Accordingly, these investments generate income tax credits and tax losses that are used to reduce the Corporations income tax liabilities. The Corporation has invested in these markets through (i) partnership arrangements in which it is a limited partner, (ii) limited liability companies (LLCs) in which it is a nonmanaging member and (iii) investments in various funds in which the Corporation is one of many noncontrolling investors. These entities borrow money from third parties generally on a nonrecourse basis and invest in and own various real estate projects. The Corporation is still evaluating the effect of FIN 46R on its real estate entities. If the Corporation is determined to be the primary beneficiary of any of these real estate entities, it will consolidate such entity as of March 31, 2004. In the December 31, 2003 financial statements, the Corporation has accounted for its interests in the real estate entities by the equity method of accounting or by the effective yield method, as appropriate, and has accounted for the related income tax credits and other tax benefits as a reduction in the income tax provision. As of December 31, 2003, the Corporation had a net equity of $132.5 million in its nonconsolidated real estate entities. Income tax credits totaling approximately $115 million will be claimed on the Corporations income tax returns through December 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2003, total permanent financing debt for the nonconsolidated entities was $284 million. A total of $31.2 million of the permanent financing debt is guaranteed by the Corporation and the remainder of this debt is not supported or guaranteed by the Corporation. Except for the guaranteed portion, permanent financing debt is secured solely by the properties and is nonrecourse to the Corporation. From time to time, temporary interim financing is guaranteed by the Corporation. In general, the Corporations interim financing guarantees are eliminated at the time permanent financing is obtained. At December 31, 2003, $7.5 million of temporary interim financing associated with these nonconsolidated real estate entities was guaranteed by the Corporation. 32 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) If the Corporations investments in these real estate entities were to be disposed of at their carrying amounts, a portion of the tax credits may be recaptured and may result in a charge to earnings. As of December 31, 2003, this recapture risk is estimated to be $57 million. The Corporation has no current intention of disposing of these investments during the recapture period, nor does it anticipate the need to do so in the foreseeable future in order to satisfy any anticipated liquidity need. Accordingly, the recapture risk is considered to be remote. At December 31, 2003, the Corporations maximum loss exposure for its real estate entities is estimated to be $228 million and was composed of its net equity in these entities of $132.5 million, its permanent financing guarantees of $31.2 million, its interim financing guarantees of $7.5 million and the income tax credit recapture risk of $57 million. Management believes the likelihood of loss on these projects is not material due to the current economic returns on these projects. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates, and changes in these estimates are recorded when known. The critical accounting policies used by management in the preparation of the Corporations consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of the Corporations financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used. The critical judgments by management relate to consumer and trade promotion and rebate accruals, pension benefits, retained insurable risks, excess and obsolete inventory, allowance for doubtful accounts, useful lives for depreciation and amortization, future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill and long lived assets and for determining the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities, deferred tax assets and potential income tax assessments, and contingencies. The Corporations critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Promotion and Rebate Accruals Among those factors affecting the accruals for promotions and rebates are estimates of the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed, the type and number of activities within promotional programs between the Corporation and its trade customers and the quantity of products distributors have sold to specific customers. Generally, we base our estimates for consumer coupon costs on historical patterns of coupon redemption, influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories. Estimates of trade promotion liabilities for promotional program costs incurred, but unpaid, are generally based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales, timing of promotional activities and forecasted costs for activities within the promotional programs. Settlement of these liabilities sometimes occurs in periods subsequent to the date of the promotion activity. Trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees, cooperative marketing programs, temporary price reductions, favorable end of aisle or in store product displays and other activities conducted by the customers to promote the Corporations products. Promotion accruals as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 were $222.0 million and $227.7 million, respectively. Rebate accruals as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 were $136.4 million and $159.5 million, respectively. Pension Benefits The Corporation and its subsidiaries in North America and the United Kingdom have defined benefit pension plans (the Principal Plans) and or defined contribution retirement plans covering substantially all regular employees. Certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or, in certain countries, 33 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees. The funding policy for the qualified defined benefit plans in North America and the defined benefit plans in the United Kingdom is to contribute assets to fully fund the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO). Subject to regulatory and tax deductibility limits, any funding shortfall will be eliminated over a reasonable number of years. Nonqualified U.S. plans providing pension benefits in excess of limitations imposed by the U.S. income tax code are not funded. Funding for the remaining defined benefit plans outside the U.S. is based on legal requirements, tax considerations, investment opportunities, and customary business practices in such countries. Consolidated pension expense for defined benefit pension plans was $168 million in 2003 compared with $32 million for 2002. Pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions applied to each of the defined benefit plans. The weighted average expected long term rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense was 8.42 percent in 2003 compared with 9.19 percent in 2002 and will be 8.32 percent in 2004. The expected long term rate of return on pension fund assets was determined based on several factors, including input from our pension investment consultants and projected long term returns of broad equity and bond indices. We also considered our U.S. plans historical 10 year and 15 year compounded annual returns of 10.1 percent and 10.3 percent, respectively, which have been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices. We anticipate that on average the investment managers for each of the plans comprising the Principal Plans will generate annual long term rates of return of at least 8.5 percent. Our expected long term rate of return on the assets in the Principal Plans is based on an asset allocation assumption of about 70 percent with equity managers, with expected long term rates of return of approximately 10 percent, and 30 percent with fixed income managers, with an expected long term rate of return of about 6 percent. We regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Also, when deemed appropriate, we execute hedging strategies using index options and futures to limit the downside exposure of certain investments by trading off upside potential above an acceptable level. We executed such hedging strategies in 2003, 2002 and 2001. No hedging instruments are currently in place beyond January 2004. We will continue to evaluate our long term rate of return assumptions at least annually and will adjust them as necessary. We determine pension expense on the fair value of assets rather than a calculated value that averages gains and losses (Calculated Value) over a period of years. Investment gains or losses represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the fair value of assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets. We recognize the variance between actual and expected gains and losses on pension assets in pension expense more rapidly than we would if we used a Calculated Value for plan assets. As of December 31, 2003, the Principal Plans had cumulative unrecognized investment losses and other actuarial losses of approximately $1.6 billion. These unrecognized net losses may increase our future pension expense if not offset by (i) actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns, or (ii) other factors, including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate our pension obligations, or (iii) other actuarial gains, including whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the corridor determined under SFAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions. The discount (or settlement) rate that we utilize for determining the present value of future pension obligations generally has been based in the U.S. on the yield reported for the long term AA rated corporate bond indexes, converted to an equivalent one year compound basis. From time to time, and most recently at December 31, 2002, we validated this practice by assembling a hypothetical portfolio of high quality debt securities where the portfolio cash flows correspond to expected future benefit payments. We use similar techniques for establishing the discount rates for our non U.S. Principal Plans. The weighted average discount rate for the Principal Plans decreased to 5.97 percent at December 31, 2003 from 6.68 percent at December 31, 2002. 34 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) We estimate that our consolidated pension expense will approximate $180 million in 2004. This estimate reflects the effect of the actuarial losses and is based on an expected weighted average long term rate of return on assets in the Principal Plans of 8.50 percent, a weighted average discount rate for the Principal Plans of 5.97 percent and various other assumptions. Pension expense beyond 2004 will depend on future investment performance, the Corporations contributions to the pension trusts, changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans. If the expected long term rate of return on assets for our Principal Plans was lowered by 0.25 percent, our annual pension expense would increase by approximately $9 million. If the discount rate assumptions for these same plans were reduced by 0.25 percent, our annual pension expense would increase by approximately $13 million and our December 31, 2003 minimum pension liability would increase by about $142 million. The fair value of the assets in our defined benefit plans increased from $3.4 billion at December 31, 2002 to $4.0 billion at December 31, 2003, primarily due to investment gains and plan contributions exceeding payments for pension benefits and plan expenses. Lower discount rates have caused the projected benefit obligations (the PBO) of the defined benefit plans to exceed the fair value of plan assets by approximately $1.2 billion at December 31, 2003, compared with approximately $1.0 billion at December 31, 2002. Primarily due to the lower discount rates, the ABO of our defined benefit plans exceeded plan assets by about $.8 billion at the end of 2003. At the end of 2002, the ABO exceeded the fair value of plan assets by about $.7 billion. On a consolidated basis, the Corporation contributed about $184 million to pension trusts in 2003 compared with $126 million in 2002. In addition, the Corporation made direct benefit payments of $29.7 million in 2003 compared to $12.2 million in 2002. We estimate that the Corporation will contribute about $100 million to pension trusts in 2004. The discount rate used for each countrys pension obligation is identical to the discount rate used for that countrys other postretirement obligation. The discount rates displayed for the two types of obligations for the Corporations consolidated operations may appear different due to the weighting used in the calculation of the two weighted average discount rates. Retained Insurable Risks We retain selected insurable risks, primarily related to property damage, workers compensation, and product, automobile and premises liability based upon historical loss patterns and managements judgment of cost effective risk retention. Accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported events, principally related to workers compensation and automobile liability, are based upon loss development factors provided to us by our external insurance brokers. Excess and Obsolete Inventory We require all excess, obsolete, damaged or off quality inventories including raw materials, in process, finished goods, and spare parts to be adequately reserved for or to be disposed of. Our process requires an ongoing tracking of the aging of inventories to be reviewed in conjunction with current marketing plans to ensure that any excess or obsolete inventories are identified on a timely basis. This process requires judgments be made about the salability of existing stock in relation to sales projections. The evaluation of the adequacy of provision for obsolete and excess inventories is performed on at least a quarterly basis. No provisions for future anticipated obsolescence, damage or off quality inventories are made. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts that represents our best estimate of the accounts receivable that will ultimately not be collected. We base our estimate on, among other things, historical collection 35 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) experience, a review of the current aging status of customer receivables, and a review of specific information for those customers that are deemed to be higher risk. When we become aware of a customer whose continued operating success is questionable, we closely monitor collection of their receivable balance and may require the customer to prepay for current shipments. If a customer enters a bankruptcy action, we monitor the progress of that action to determine when and if an additional provision for non collectibility is warranted. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on at least a quarterly basis. The allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $47.9 million and $48.4 million, respectively, and our write off of uncollectible accounts was $15.5 million and $12.0 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Property and Depreciation Estimating the useful lives of property, plant and equipment requires the exercise of management judgment, and actual lives may differ from these estimates. Changes to these initial useful life estimates are made when appropriate. Property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment in accordance with SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such long lived assets may not be recoverable from future net pretax cash flows. Impairment testing requires significant management judgment including estimating the future success of product lines, future sales volumes, growth rates for selling prices and costs, alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets. Impairment testing is conducted at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured and are independent of cash flows of other assets. An asset impairment would be indicated if the sum of the expected future net pretax cash flows from the use of the asset (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss would be measured based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount. We determine fair value based on an expected present value technique in which multiple cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes and a risk free rate of interest are used to estimate fair value. The estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis are consistent with the business plans and estimates we use to manage our business operations and to make acquisition and divestiture decisions. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and would increase or decrease the impairment charge. Actual outcomes may differ from the estimates. For example, if our products fail to achieve volume and pricing estimates or if market conditions change or other significant estimates are not realized, then our revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved, and we may be required to recognize additional impairment charges. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We test the carrying amount of goodwill annually as of the beginning of the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Impairment testing is performed in accordance with SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Impairment testing is conducted at the operating segment level of our businesses and is based on a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of each operating segment. The determination of fair value requires significant management judgment including estimating future sales volumes, growth rates of selling prices and costs, changes in working capital, investments in property and equipment and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. We also test the sensitivities of these fair value estimates to changes in our growth assumptions of sales volumes, selling prices and costs. If the carrying amount of an operating segment that contains goodwill exceeds fair value, a possible impairment would be indicated. If a possible impairment is indicated, we would estimate the implied fair value of goodwill by comparing the carrying amount of the net assets of the unit excluding goodwill to the total fair value of the unit. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment charge would be 36 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) recorded. We also use judgment in assessing whether we need to test more frequently for impairment than annually. Factors such as unexpected adverse economic conditions, competition, product changes and other external events may require more frequent assessments. We have completed our annual goodwill impairment testing and have determined that none of our $2.6 billion of goodwill is impaired. We have no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. We have other intangible assets with a gross carrying amount of approximately $267 million and a net carrying amount of about $192 million. These intangibles are being amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss would be indicated. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the intangible asset over its discounted future cash flows. We use judgment in assessing whether the carrying amount of our intangible assets is not expected to be recoverable over their estimated remaining useful lives. The factors considered are similar to those outlined in the goodwill impairment discussion above. Primary Beneficiary Determination of Variable Interest Entities The determination of the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities (VIEs) under FIN 46R requires estimating the probable future cash flows of each VIE using a computer simulation model, determining the variability of such cash flows and their present values. Estimating the probable future cash flows of each VIE requires the exercise of significant management judgment. The resulting present values are then allocated to the various participants in each VIE in accordance with their beneficial interests. The participant that is allocated the majority of the present value of the variability is the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE under FIN 46R. Deferred Income Taxes and Potential Assessments As of December 31, 2003, the Corporation has recorded deferred tax assets related to income tax loss carryforwards and income tax credits totaling $468.0 million and has established valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets of $247.9 million, thereby resulting in a net deferred tax asset of $220.1 million. As of December 31, 2002, the net deferred tax asset was $242.6 million. These income tax losses and credits are in non U.S. taxing jurisdictions and in certain states within the U.S. In determining the valuation allowances to establish against these deferred tax assets, the Corporation considers many factors, including the specific taxing jurisdiction, the carryforward period, income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, the Corporation concludes that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. As of December 31, 2003, United States income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately $3.7 billion of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries operating outside the U.S. in accordance with APB 23, Accounting for Income Taxes, Special Areas. These earnings are considered by management to be invested indefinitely. However, they would be subject to income tax if they were remitted as dividends, were lent to the Corporation or a U.S. affiliate, or if the Corporation were to sell its stock in the subsidiaries. It is not practicable to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability on these unremitted earnings. We periodically determine whether our non U.S. subsidiaries will invest their undistributed earnings indefinitely and reassess this determination as appropriate. Following this assessment, we would provide deferred income taxes on any earnings that were determined to no longer be indefinitely invested. In addition, we have recorded a liability for potential income tax assessments. Although management believes this liability for potential exposure to be adequate, the liability may be affected by new laws, new 37 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) interpretations of existing laws and rulings by tax authorities. Accordingly, actual payments may differ from estimates, at which time our income tax expense would be adjusted. The Internal Revenue Service is currently examining our consolidated income tax returns for 1999 through 2001. The examination is expected to be completed by the end of 2004. Contingencies and Legal Matters Litigation The following is a brief description of certain legal and administrative proceedings to which the Corporation or its subsidiaries is a party or to which the Corporations or its subsidiaries properties are subject. In managements opinion, none of the legal and administrative proceedings described below, individually or in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on the Corporations business, financial condition or results of operations. As of December 31, 2003, Safeskin was a party to product liability lawsuits seeking monetary damages, in most cases of an unspecified amount. Safeskin is typically one of several defendants who manufacture or sell natural rubber latex gloves. These lawsuits allege injuries ranging from dermatitis to severe allergic reactions caused by the residual chemicals or latex proteins in gloves worn by health care workers and other individuals while performing their duties. Safeskin has referred the defense of these lawsuits to its insurance carriers and management believes its insurance coverage is adequate for these types of claims. As of December 31, 2003, the Corporation, along with many other nonaffiliated companies, was a party to lawsuits with allegations of personal injury resulting from asbestos exposure on the defendants premises and allegations that the defendants manufactured, sold, distributed or installed products which cause asbestos related lung disease. These general allegations are often made against the Corporation without any apparent evidence or identification of a specific product or premises of the Corporation. The Corporation has denied the allegations and raised numerous defenses in all of these asbestos cases. All asbestos claims have been tendered to the Corporations insurance carriers for defense and indemnity. The financial statements reflect appropriate accruals for the Corporations portion of the costs estimated to be incurred in connection with resolving these claims. Contingency One of the Corporations North American tissue mills has an agreement to provide its local utility company a specified amount of electric power for each of the next 15 years. In the event that the mill was shut down, the Corporation would be required to continue to operate the power generation facility on behalf of its owner, the local utility company. The net present value of the cost to fulfill this agreement as of December 31, 2003 is estimated to be approximately $100 million. Management considers the probability of closure of this mill to be remote. Environmental Matters The Corporation has been named a potentially responsible party under the provisions of the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or analogous state statutes, at a number of waste disposal sites, none of which, individually or in the aggregate, in managements opinion, is likely to have a material adverse effect on the Corporations business, financial condition or results of operations. New Accounting Standards In December 2003, FASB issued FIN 46R. FIN 46R requires consolidation of entities in which the Corporation is the primary beneficiary, despite not having voting control. Likewise, it does not permit 38 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) consolidation of entities in which the Corporation has voting control but is not the primary beneficiary. The Corporation adopted FIN 46R for its Luxembourg based financing subsidiary described in Financing Commentary and the Financing Entities described in Variable Interest Entities. As permitted by FIN 46R, the Corporation has deferred application of FIN 46R to March 31, 2004 for its Real Estate Entities and the Synthetic Fuel Partnership described above. On December 8, 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) became law. Among other things, the Act provides a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D) and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a prescription drug benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. The Corporation could amend its retiree health care benefit plans to better align the plans with the new Act. In accordance with FASB Staff Position 106 1, the Corporation has elected to defer recognizing the effects of the Act because authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy provided by the Act is pending. Such guidance, when issued by the FASB, may require the Corporation to change previously reported information. Consequently, the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and net periodic postretirement cost presented in the financial statements and accompanying notes do not reflect the effects of the Act. In December 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 132 (revised 2003), Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, (SFAS 132R). SFAS 132R revises the disclosures for pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. The Corporation adopted SFAS 132Rs 2003 annual disclosure requirements. SFAS 132R will require certain additional disclosures in 2004 including disclosure of interim period information. The Corporation will adopt the additional disclosure requirements of SFAS 132R in accordance with its prescribed effective dates. Business Outlook The Corporations priorities for 2004 are to deliver top and bottom line growth in line with the long term Global Business Plan objectives that were announced in July 2003. Those targets are 3 to 5 percent top line growth and mid to high single digit bottom line growth. The Corporation also intends to deliver the benefits from its new capital allocation process, namely, to reduce capital spending and to focus on improving working capital as a percent of net sales. The expectation that net sales will grow 3 to 5 percent assumes that volume growth will be the key driver. Based on current exchange rates, currency effects are expected to be somewhat positive but less than 1 percent for 2004 as a whole. However, the currency effect will be offset by lower pricing as the Corporation is expecting continued intense competition. Net income growth is anticipated to be achieved with the improved net sales helping to drive earnings growth as well as a continued focus on sustainable cost reduction. The Corporation has set an aggressive target for 2004 to reduce costs by approximately $150 million. These cost savings should more than offset anticipated inflationary cost increases in fiber, energy and employee health care in 2004 along with a modest increase in pension expense. In addition, the Corporation foresees improved results from K C de Mexico in 2004, building on the strong sales volume momentum in that companys consumer business in the second half of 2003. Including the impact of a slightly higher effective tax rate, the Corporation anticipates that diluted earnings per share will be in a range of $3.55 to $3.65 for 2004. The Corporation expects that capital spending will be about $750 million in 2004, toward the low end of its long term target of 5 to 6 percent of net sales. The Corporation believes that its cash flows will remain strong which will allow it to spend approximately $500 million to repurchase about 2 percent of its outstanding common stock, depending on market conditions. Also, the Corporations solid cash flow has enabled it to raise its dividend by nearly 18 percent in 2004, marking the 32nd consecutive annual increase in its dividend. 39 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) The Corporation expects that the synthetic fuel partnership transaction entered into in 2003 will result in expenses, federal income tax benefits and additional net income annually through 2007. The Corporation anticipates that the benefit in 2004 will be slightly higher than in 2003, while 2005 and 2006 will be similar to 2003, and 2007 is expected to be somewhat lower than 2003. However, the benefits from this transaction in those subsequent years are expected to be partially offset by the expiration of benefits from other tax savings initiatives. In January 2004, the Corporation announced changes to reorganize its personal care and consumer tissue businesses into two separate North Atlantic personal care and consumer tissue groups and to put its operations in developing and emerging markets into one group. The Corporations business to business segment will now include its North American pulp operations. In addition, the wet wipes business will be part of the personal care segment instead of the consumer tissue segment. The Corporation will continue to have three global businesses led by individuals who have the accountability and the authority to make global decisions. This new structure is expected to help increase the Corporations speed in translating consumer and customer insights into innovative products, streamlining decision making and helping to deliver cost reductions on a sustainable basis. On February 25, 2004, the Corporation announced that it was evaluating the possible tax free spin off of its Neenah Paper and Technical Paper businesses, along with its pulp and timber assets in Pictou, Nova Scotia and Terrace Bay, Ontario (the Pulp and Paper operations). The transaction is subject to approval by the Board of Directors and, if approved, is expected to occur in the second half of 2004. The following supplementary information presents the historical net sales of the Corporation excluding the Pulp and Paper operations and the historical net sales on a stand alone basis of the Pulp and Paper operations. The combination of the net sales of the Corporation excluding the Pulp and Paper operations and the net sales of the Pulp and Paper operations on a stand alone basis will not equal the Corporations consolidated net sales because intercompany transactions are eliminated in the preparation of the Corporations consolidated financial statements. The net sales of the Pulp and Paper operations may not be indicative of its net sales in the future, or what they would have been if the Pulp and Paper operations had been a separate company during the periods presented. The Corporations historical net sales excluding the Pulp and Paper operations were $13,951.1 million and $13,149.9 million for 2003 and 2002, respectively. The historical net sales of the Pulp and Paper operations on a stand alone basis were approximately $650 million and $640 million for 2003 and 2002, respectively. Intercompany transfers of pulp from the Pulp and Paper operations to the Corporation (pulp sales by the pulp business and pulp purchases by the Corporation) are included in the Corporations consolidated financial statements at cost. If the spin off of the Pulp and Paper operations occurs, any pulp purchased by the Corporation from the stand alone Pulp and Paper operations will be based on market prices, which could be more or less than historical costs. Information Concerning Forward Looking Statements Certain matters discussed in this report concerning, among other things, the business outlook, including new product introductions, cost savings, anticipated financial and operating results, strategies, contingencies and contemplated transactions of the Corporation, constitute forward looking statements and are based upon managements expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting the Corporation. There can be no assurance that these events will occur or that the Corporations results will be as estimated. 40 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) The assumptions used as a basis for the forward looking statements include many estimates that, among other things, depend on the achievement of future cost savings and projected volume increases. In addition, many factors outside the control of the Corporation, including the prices of the Corporations raw materials, potential competitive pressures on selling prices or advertising and promotion expenses for the Corporations products, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as general economic conditions in the markets in which the Corporation does business, also could impact the realization of such estimates. For a description of these and other factors that could cause the Corporations future results to differ materially from those expressed in any such forward looking statements, see Item I of this Annual Report on Form 10 K entitled Factors That May Affect Future Results. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a multinational enterprise, the Corporation is exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. A variety of practices are employed to manage these risks, including operating and financing activities and, where deemed appropriate, the use of derivative instruments. Derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation or trading. All foreign currency derivative instruments are either exchange traded or are entered into with major financial institutions. The Corporations credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to the fair value of the agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date. Credit risk with respect to the counterparties is considered minimal in view of the financial strength of the counterparties. In accordance with SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, the Corporation records all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are either recorded in income or other comprehensive income, as appropriate. The gain or loss on derivatives designated as fair value hedges and the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are included in current income in the period that changes in fair value occur. The gain or loss on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is included in other comprehensive income in the period that changes in fair value occur and is reclassified to income in the same period that the hedged item affects income. The gain or loss on derivatives that have not been designated as hedging instruments is included in current income in the period that changes in fair value occur. Presented below is a description of our most significant risks (foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and commodity price risk) together with a sensitivity analysis, performed annually, of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices. These analyses reflect our view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a one year period. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is managed by the use of foreign currency forward, option and swap contracts. The use of these instruments allows management of transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset, in whole or in part, losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure. Management of foreign currency transactional exposures was not changed during 2003, and management does not foresee or expect any significant change in such exposures or in the strategies it employs to manage them in the near future. Foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We perform an annual test to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on our annual operating profit based on the foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures of the Corporation and its foreign affiliates at the current year end. The effect is 41 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) calculated by multiplying each affiliates net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the U.S. dollar. The results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph. As of December 31, 2003, a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in a net pretax loss of approximately $49 million. These hypothetical losses on transactional exposures are based on the difference between the December 31, 2003 rates and the assumed rates. In the view of management, the above hypothetical losses resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the Corporations consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The translation of the balance sheets of our non U.S. operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Consequently, we perform an annual test to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of our non U.S. operations into U.S. dollars. These translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments (UTA) within stockholders equity. The hypothetical increase in UTA is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these non U.S. operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates. The results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph. As of December 31, 2003, a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the prevailing market rates of our foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced stockholders equity by approximately $285 million. These hypothetical increases in UTA are based on the difference between the December 31, 2003 exchange rates and the assumed rates. In the view of management, the above UTA adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the Corporations consolidated financial position. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable and fixed rate debt composed of short and long term instruments. The objective is to maintain a cost effective mix that management deems appropriate. At December 31, 2003, the debt portfolio was composed of approximately 35 percent variable rate debt, adjusted for the effect of variable rate assets, and 65 percent fixed rate debt. The strategy employed to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations did not change significantly during 2003 and management does not foresee or expect any significant changes in its exposure to interest rate fluctuations or in how such exposure is managed in the near future. We perform two separate tests to determine whether changes in interest rates would have a significant effect on our financial position or future results of operations. Both tests are based on our consolidated debt levels at the time of the test. The first test estimates the effect of interest rate changes on our fixed rate debt. Interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of fixed rate debt due to differences between the current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments. With respect to fixed rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2003, a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixed rate debt by about $120 million. The second test estimates the potential effect on future pretax income that would result from increased interest rates applied to our current level of variable rate debt. With respect to commercial paper and other variable rate debt, a 10 percent increase in interest rates would have had no material effect on the future results of operations or cash flows. Commodity Price Risk The Corporation is subject to commodity price risk, the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp. Selling prices of tissue products are influenced, in part, by the market price for pulp, which is determined 42 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) by industry supply and demand. On a worldwide basis, the Corporation supplies approximately 40 percent of its virgin fiber needs from internal pulp manufacturing operations. Management still intends to reduce its level of pulp integration, when market conditions permit, and such a reduction in pulp integration, if accomplished, could increase the Corporations commodity price risk. Specifically, increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. Derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks. Management does not believe that commodity price risk is material to the Corporations business or its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, the Corporation is subject to price risk for utilities, primarily natural gas, which are used in its manufacturing operations. Derivative instruments are used to hedge this risk when it is deemed prudent to do so by management. 43 Table of Contents PART II (Continued)
