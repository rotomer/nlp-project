ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Introduction This managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to provide investors with an understanding of the Corporations past performance, its financial condition and its prospects. The following will be discussed and analyzed: Overview of Business Overview of 2004 Results Results of Operations and Related Information Liquidity and Capital Resources Variable Interest Entities Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates Contingencies and Legal Matters New Accounting Standards Business Outlook Information Concerning Forward Looking Statements Overview of Business The Corporation is a global health and hygiene company with manufacturing facilities in 37 countries and its products are sold in more than 150 countries. The Corporations products are sold under such well known brands as Kleenex, Scott, Huggies, Pull Ups, Kotex and Depend. The Corporation has three reportable global business segments: Personal Care, Consumer Tissue and Business to Business. These global business segments are described in greater detail in Item 1 of this Form 10 K and in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In managing this global business, the Corporations management believes that developing new and improved products, responding effectively to competitive challenges, obtaining and maintaining leading market shares, controlling costs, and managing currency and commodity risks are important to the long term success of the Corporation. The discussion and analysis of results of operations and other related information will refer to these factors. Product innovation Past results and future prospects depend in large part on product innovation. The Corporation relies on its ability to develop and introduce new or improved products to drive sales and volume growth and to achieve and or maintain category leadership. In order to develop new or improved products, the technology to support those products must be developed. Research and development expenditures are directed towards new or improved personal care, tissue and health care products and nonwoven materials. Competitive environment Past results and future prospects are significantly affected by the competitive environment in which we operate. We experience intense competition for sales of our principal products in our major markets, both domestically and internationally. Our products compete with widely advertised, well known, branded products, as well as private label products, which are typically sold at lower prices. We have several major competitors in most of our markets, some of which are larger and more diversified. The principal methods and elements of competition include brand recognition and loyalty, product innovation, quality and performance, price, and marketing and distribution capabilities. 16 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) Aggressive competitive actions in 2003 and 2004 have required increased promotional spending to support new product introductions and enable competitive pricing in order to protect the position of the Corporations products in the market. We expect competition to continue to be intense in 2005. Market shares Achieving leading market shares in our principal products has been an important part of our past performance. We hold the number 1 or 2 brand position in more than 80 countries. Achieving and maintaining leading market shares is important because of ongoing consolidation of retailers and the trend of leading merchandisers seeking to stock only the top competitive brands. Cost controls To maintain our competitive position, we must control our manufacturing, distribution and other costs. We have achieved cost savings from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains and distribution efficiencies in each of our business segments. Our ability to control costs can be affected by changes in the price of oil, pulp and other commodities we consume in our manufacturing processes. Our strategic investments in information systems should also allow further cost savings through streamlining administrative activities. Foreign currency and commodity risks As a multinational enterprise, we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and we are also exposed to commodity prices. Our ability to effectively manage these risks can have a material impact on our results of operations. On November 30, 2004, the Corporation distributed to its stockholders all of the shares of common stock of Neenah Paper, Inc. (Neenah Paper), a wholly owned subsidiary formed in April 2004 to facilitate the spin off of the U.S. fine and technical papers businesses and the Canadian pulp mills (the Spin off). In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, prior period Consolidated Income Statements and Cash Flow Statements and related disclosures present the results of Neenah Papers fine paper and technical paper businesses, which were previously included in the Business to Business segment, as discontinued operations. Prior to the Spin off, the Corporation internally consumed approximately 90 percent of the pulp produced by the Canadian pulp business. In connection with the Spin off, the Corporation entered into a long term pulp supply agreement to purchase a substantial portion of the pulp produced by Neenah Paper. Because we will continue to incur pulp costs in our operations, the results of Neenah Papers Canadian pulp business have not been reported as discontinued operations in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144. The following discussion and analysis is based on a comparison of the Corporations continuing operations. Overview of 2004 Results During 2004, the Corporation continued to face intense competition in most of its markets. In particular, the diaper and pants categories in North America and Europe continued to be affected by the competitive pricing pressures that began in late 2002. The tissue businesses were also adversely affected by higher fiber costs, and all of the businesses faced higher materials input costs. Despite these challenges, improved results were achieved in 2004: Net sales grew 7.5 percent. Net sales advanced in each of the three business segments and in each geographic region. Innovative and improved products such as Huggies Convertibles diaper pants, Huggies diapers with Triple Leak Protection, Pull Ups training pants with easy open sides, gender specific GoodNites youth pants, Anti viral Kleenex tissue, Scott Coreless Jumbo bathroom tissue and Kotex Lightdays everyday pantiliners contributed to increased sales volumes. 17 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) Operating profit increased 7.5 percent and income and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 7.7 percent and 9.9 percent, respectively. Increased sales volumes more than offset the effect of lower net selling prices. Cost savings of nearly $160 million helped to temper the effects of higher costs for fiber, other materials, energy and distribution of over $180 million. Cash flow from operations in 2004 set a record for the fourth consecutive year. The Corporation repurchased 24.8 million shares of its common stock for about $1.6 billion. Annual cash dividends were increased by 17.6 percent in 2004 and will increase another 12.5 percent in 2005. Market Shares U.S. market shares are tracked on a sales dollar basis with information provided by A.C. Nielsen for distribution through the food, drug and mass merchandising channels, excluding Wal Mart, warehouse clubs, dollar stores and certain other outlets. These customers do not report market share information publicly. The A.C. Nielsen data provides coverage ranging from approximately 40 percent to 60 percent of the retail value of products sold, depending upon the product category. Shown below are the Corporations U.S. market shares for key categories for full years 2002 through 2004: Category 2004 2003 2002 Diapers 38 % 38 % 40 % Training, Youth and Swim Pants 69 % 68 % 73 % Feminine Care 20 % 22 % 23 % Adult Incontinence Care 56 % 56 % 55 % Baby Wipes 40 % 41 % 42 % Facial Tissue 51 % 53 % 54 % Bathroom Tissue 29 % 28 % 27 % Paper Towels 19 % 19 % 19 % 18 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) Results of Operations and Related Information This section contains a discussion and analysis of net sales, operating profit and other information relevant to an understanding of 2004 results of operations. This discussion and analysis compares 2004 results to 2003, and 2003 results to 2002. Each of those discussions focuses first on consolidated results, and then the results of each reportable business segment. Analysis of Consolidated Net Sales By Business Segment Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (Millions of dollars) Personal Care $ 5,975.1 $ 5,652.9 $ 5,485.5 Consumer Tissue 5,343.0 5,046.7 4,635.2 Business to Business 3,957.9 3,477.7 3,256.7 Intersegment sales (192.8 ) (151.0 ) (145.9 ) Consolidated $ 15,083.2 $ 14,026.3 $ 13,231.5 By Geographic Area Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (Millions of dollars) United States $ 8,683.5 $ 8,335.8 $ 8,314.4 Canada 911.0 801.8 831.4 Intergeographic sales (554.4 ) (515.6 ) (601.2 ) Total North America 9,040.1 8,622.0 8,544.6 Europe 3,098.3 2,892.5 2,482.8 Asia, Latin America and other 3,488.8 3,061.6 2,751.5 Intergeographic sales (544.0 ) (549.8 ) (547.4 ) Consolidated $ 15,083.2 $ 14,026.3 $ 13,231.5 Commentary: 2004 versus 2003 Percent Change in Sales Versus Prior Year TotalChange Change Due To Volume NetPrice Currency Other TotalVolume OrganicGrowth Acquisitions Consolidated 8 5 4 1 (1) 3 1 Personal Care 6 4 4 (2) 3 1 Consumer Tissue 6 3 1 2 4 (1) Business to Business 14 7 7 (1) 3 5 Consolidated net sales increased 7.5 percent from 2003. Sales volumes advanced approximately 5 percent with contributions from each of the business segments. About 1 percentage point of the increase in sales volumes 19 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) was due to the consolidation, in August 2003, of Klabin Kimberly S.A. (Klabin), a former equity affiliate and Brazils largest tissue manufacturer. Currency effects added more than 3 percent to the increase primarily due to strengthening of the euro, British pound, and Australian and Canadian dollars. Slightly lower net selling prices were offset by a more favorable product mix. Worldwide personal care net sales rose 5.7 percent due to higher sales volumes, mainly in North America, favorable currency effects in Europe and Australia and better product mix in Central America, partially offset by lower net selling prices primarily in North America and Europe. In North America, net sales increased nearly 5 percent driven by a more than 6 percent sales volume increase reflecting higher sales of Huggies diapers and double digit growth for child care products GoodNites youth underpants, Pull Ups training pants, Little Swimmers swimpants and incontinence brands Poise and Depend. Net selling prices declined about 2 percent primarily in response to competitive activity. Favorable Canadian dollar exchange rate effects also contributed to the increase in net sales. The increased child care volumes are due to strong category growth through increased consumer usage. Market share for feminine care products declined as a result of significant competitive activity. Net sales in Europe were even with last year as 10 percent favorable currency effects were offset by almost 7 percent lower sales volumes and a 3 percent reduction in net selling prices. Lower sales volumes for diapers and feminine care products, resulting from aggressive competitive price reductions and promotion spending, more than offset higher sales volumes for child and adult care products. Except for child care, which benefited from a prior year price increase, net selling prices declined due to competitive activity. In the developing and emerging markets, net sales increased about 10 percent with higher sales volumes and favorable currency effects each contributing about 5 percent, while improved product mix essentially offset lower net selling prices. Advances in sales volumes and favorable currency were realized in both Korea and Australia. Latin America and Israel also recorded higher sales volumes. Worldwide consumer tissue net sales increased 5.9 percent on higher sales volumes, primarily in North America, the consolidation of Klabin and favorable currency effects, principally in Europe, partially offset by lower intersegment sales. Net selling prices were even with the prior year. In North America, net sales increased almost 4 percent with higher sales volumes and net selling prices each contributing about 2 percent. The higher sales volumes were led by increased sales for Scott bathroom tissue and private label, partially offset by lower sales volumes for Kleenex facial tissue. In the third quarter of 2004, the Corporation implemented list price increases on its bathroom and facial tissue products and on paper towels. These price increases along with a reduction in trade promotion spending in the fourth quarter contributed to the higher net selling prices. In facial tissue products, the Corporations main competitor did not match the Corporations price increases in some product codes, which is reflected in the Corporations lower market share for the category. The third quarter 2004 introduction of Kleenex Anti viral facial tissue contributed to a slight increase in net sales due to product mix. In Europe, net sales increased nearly 9 percent because of an almost 11 percent favorable effect from currency tempered by lower net selling prices that reflect the continuing competitive marketplace. Sales volumes were nearly 1 percent higher primarily due to increased sales of Andrex products in the United Kingdom. In the developing and emerging markets, net sales advanced approximately 20 percent on a sales volume increase of more than 11 percent, of which about 7 percentage points was attributable to the consolidation of Klabin, favorable currency effects of almost 5 percent, primarily in Australia, and a favorable product mix. 20 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) Worldwide net sales for products in the business to business segment increased 13.8 percent driven by nearly 7 percent higher sales volumes, more than 3 percent favorable currency effects and higher intersegment sales, tempered by less than 2 percent lower net selling prices. Sales volume growth was led by more than an 8 percent volume increase in global health care. Professional products achieved more than 5 percent higher sales volumes and higher sales of nonwoven products provided additional benefit. The favorable currency effects were principally due to Europe. Despite price increases in the fourth quarter for professional products in North America, net selling prices for the year declined due to price erosion in contract business across the segment. 2003 versus 2002 Percent Change in Sales Versus Prior Year Change Due To Volume TotalChange TotalVolume OrganicGrowth Acquisitions NetPrice Currency Other Consolidated 6 2 1 1 (1) 4 1 Personal Care 3 3 Consumer Tissue 9 4 2 2 5 Business to Business 7 3 3 (2) 5 1 Consolidated net sales increased 6.0 percent over 2002. In addition to favorable currency effects of about 4 percent, higher sales volumes of more than 2 percent more than offset slightly lower net selling prices. The favorable currency effects, primarily in Europe and Australia, were tempered by unfavorable currency effects in Latin America. Slightly less than one half of the increased sales volumes were due to the consolidation of Klabin and the February 2003 acquisition of the Klucze tissue business in Poland. Worldwide sales of personal care products increased 3.1 percent due to favorable currency exchange rates. Overall sales volumes and net selling prices were the same as 2002. In North America, net sales increased about 1 percent. Favorable Canadian exchange rate effects and product mix more than offset lower net selling prices of about 1 percent. Increased sales volumes for training pants and incontinence care products were offset by decreased sales volume for diapers that were affected by aggressive competitive actions. Training pants products achieved an all time record for annual shipments even though U.S. market share for 2003 was below the prior years full year share. Net sales in Europe increased about 4 percent as favorable currency effects more than offset 7 percent lower sales volumes due to aggressive competitive consumer promotion activity. Lower diaper sales volumes were partially offset by increased sales volumes for incontinence care products and training pants. In the developing and emerging markets, net sales increased about 8 percent. Currency effects were approximately 3 percent favorable. Sales volumes and net selling prices each contributed about 2 percent with favorable product mix adding 1 percent. Net sales in Asia grew on higher sales volumes in Australia and currency effects in both Australia and Korea. In Latin America, net sales declined as higher net selling prices were more than offset by lower sales volumes and unfavorable currency. Net sales for the other geographies rose because of higher sales volumes and favorable currency in South Africa and higher sales volumes and favorable product mix in Eastern Europe. Worldwide sales of consumer tissue products increased 8.9 percent due to favorable currency effects, primarily in Europe and nearly 4 percent higher sales volumes. Overall net selling prices were essentially even with 2002. 21 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) In North America, net sales increased more than 1 percent on 2 percent higher sales volumes partially offset by lower net selling prices. While overall U.S. market share in the facial category for 2003 was below 2002, there was sequential improvement in both the third and fourth quarters of the year. Net sales in Europe increased more than 20 percent driven by favorable currency effects and higher sales volumes of about 5 percent, primarily due to the Klucze acquisition. Net selling prices were flat versus 2002. In the developing and emerging markets, net sales advanced nearly 15 percent as sales volumes increased almost 10 percent, primarily due to Klabin. Favorable currency effects, primarily in Australia, added 4 percent, while higher net selling prices were partially offset by a less favorable product mix. Worldwide sales of products in the business to business segment increased 6.8 percent as a result of favorable currency effects and 3 percent higher sales volumes, tempered by net selling prices that were more than 1 percent lower. The higher sales volumes were driven by advances for professional products in North America, Latin America and Asia and increased sales volumes of global health care products.

Consolidated operating profit increased 7.5 percent as the higher sales volumes, about $160 million of benefit from cost savings programs and total favorable currency effects of over $70 million more than offset the lower net selling prices, higher fiber costs and increased energy and distribution expenses. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales was 16.6 percent, the same as last year. Operating profit for personal care products increased 2.6 percent. The higher sales volumes, more than $85 million in cost savings and favorable currency effects, primarily in Australia and Canada, were partially offset by the lower net selling prices, higher raw material and distribution costs, increased advertising expenses, and costs associated with a plan to streamline diaper operations. Primarily as a result of significant productivity gains, the Corporation had available diaper manufacturing capacity in North America and Europe. Therefore, the Corporation executed a plan to cease diaper manufacturing and scale back distribution operations at its facility in New Milford, Conn. Some production capacity was also redeployed from the Barton upon Humber facility in the U.K. Diaper machines from these locations will now support growth in other markets, thereby reducing the capital spending required for this business. These steps are consistent with the Corporations strategies to drive growth in developing and emerging markets and improve its cost structure in North America and Europe. Costs to implement the infant care plan described above will total approximately $40 million before tax, including about $37 million recorded in 2004. The balance of the plan costs will be recorded in 2005 as they are incurred. Of the total 2004 cost, approximately $10 million was for employee severance recorded at the time employees were notified of their termination benefits, about $3 million for other cash costs, principally for equipment removal, and $24 million for asset write offs primarily related to the original equipment installation costs. These costs were recorded in cost of products sold. Operating profit in North America increased about 1 percent as the benefits of the higher sales volumes and cost savings programs were partially offset by the lower selling prices, costs of the infant care plan and higher advertising and distribution costs. In Europe, operating profit declined because of the negative impacts of the competitive environment on selling prices and sales volumes. Operating profit in the developing and emerging markets increased over 7 percent, principally due to higher sales volumes and favorable currency effects, partially offset by higher marketing expenses. Operating profit for consumer tissue products improved 10.3 percent driven by cost savings of almost $60 million, favorable currency effects of about $25 million and lower marketing expenses tempered by approximately $45 million of higher fiber costs, higher other raw material and energy costs and increased distribution expense. In North America, operating profit grew nearly 6 percent because of the higher sales volumes and net selling prices, cost savings, and lower marketing expenses, partially offset by higher fiber costs and increased costs for energy and distribution. Operating profit in Europe 23 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) advanced more than 8 percent principally on the strength of cost savings and favorable currency, tempered by the lower net selling prices. In the developing and emerging markets, operating profit rose more than 20 percent primarily due to favorable product mix, the higher sales volumes and currency effects. Operating profit for business to business products increased 8.9 percent. In addition to the higher sales volumes and favorable currency, the segment benefited from more than $14 million in cost savings, primarily in the professional business, and lower start up costs compared to 2003. These gains were tempered by the lower net selling prices, higher fiber costs, increased other raw materials costs, higher energy and distribution expenses, and higher general and administrative costs. Our professional and global health care businesses both had higher sales volumes in North America and Europe. Other income (expense), net in 2003 included charges of $34 million consisting of $15.6 million for a legal judgment in Europe and $18.4 million for the costs associated with the redemption of $400 million of debentures; and nearly $20 million for charges to write off an investment in an historic restoration project and to recognize impairment of a nonstrategic facility outside of North America. The higher unallocated net expenses in 2004 were primarily due to the write off of a consolidated investment in an historic renovation project, higher corporate charitable contributions and increased general business taxes. 2003 versus 2002 Percent Change in Operating Profit Versus Prior Year Change Due To Total Net Fiber Change Volume Price Cost Currency Other (a) Consolidated (2 ) 4 (3 ) (3) 3 (3 ) Personal Care 6 (1 ) 1 2 4 Consumer Tissue (10 ) 6 (2 ) (7) 3 (10 ) Business to Business 5 8 (9 ) (3) 6 3 (a) Includes pension, energy and other costs, net of cost savings achieved. Consolidated operating profit decreased 1.5 percent. Higher promotional spending, increased fiber, distribution and energy costs, increased pension expense of approximately $134 million and a higher level of expenses in other income (expense), net more than offset the benefits of cost reduction programs of about $190 million, favorable currency effects and increased sales volumes. Each of the three business segments incurred more than $40 million of the higher pension costs. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales decreased from 17.9 percent in 2002 to 16.6 percent in 2003. Operating profit for personal care products increased 5.5 percent primarily because the benefits of cost reduction programs and favorable currency effects more than offset the lower net selling prices, lower sales volumes and higher raw materials and distribution costs. Although the competitive environment remained intense through product pricing and promotional activity, North America achieved strong fourth quarter results compared with the high level of incremental promotional spending in the year ago quarter associated with diaper and training pant count changes at that time. North American operating profit for the full year increased because the aggressive cost reduction efforts more than offset lower net selling prices and the higher pension costs. Operating profit in Europe declined as lower sales volumes more than offset the benefits of cost savings programs. Operating profit in the developing and emerging markets increased because of the higher net selling prices and favorable currency, tempered by higher distribution and marketing costs. 24 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) Operating profit for consumer tissue products decreased 9.8 percent because the increased sales volumes and cost reductions were more than offset by higher fiber, distribution and energy costs, the higher pension costs and increased promotional spending. In each of the major regions North America, Europe and the developing and emerging markets operating profit declined generally due to the same factors that affected the segment overall. Operating profit for the business to business segment increased 4.9 percent as the benefits of cost savings programs, the higher sales volumes and favorable currency effects more than offset lower net selling prices, higher fiber and other materials costs, higher distribution and energy expenses, and the increased pension costs. Operating profit for professional products rose in both North America and Europe primarily due to cost reductions and favorable currency effects. Operating profit for health care products increased because of the higher sales volumes, cost savings and favorable currency effects, tempered by the lower net selling prices. In 2002, the Corporation recorded charges of approximately $43 million related to business improvement and other programs. Charges related to the plans to streamline manufacturing and administrative operations in Latin America and Europe totaled $14.3 million and $19.1 million, respectively, and consisted principally of employee severance of $16.8 million and asset write off and disposal costs of $8.4 million. The Corporation also recorded charges of approximately $3 million for employee severance to complete actions that had been initiated in 2001 and approximately $4 million for a one time national security tax levied on all corporations in Colombia. The above 2002 charges were recorded in the business segments as follows: personal care $14.8 million; consumer tissue $21.8 million; business to business $6.6 million. On a geographic basis, these charges were included as follows: North America $5.8 million; Europe $19.1 million; Asia, Latin America and other $18.3 million. These charges were included in the consolidated income statement as follows: cost of products sold $19.1 million, consisting principally of employee severance and asset write off costs; marketing, research and general expenses $24.1 million, consisting principally of severance, training and other integration costs in Europe. Other income (expense), net in 2003 included the previously mentioned charges of $34 million and nearly $20 million. Included in 2002 were $21 million of charges related to the settlement in December 2002 of securities and shareholder derivative litigation involving Safeskin Corporation (Safeskin) and a charge of $26.5 million for the write off of tax credits in Brazil. The litigation predated the Corporations February 2000 acquisition of Safeskin. In addition, the Corporation recorded currency transaction losses in 2003 compared with gains in 2002. Operating losses related to the Corporations participation in affordable housing and historic renovation projects increased compared with 2002. Additional Income Statement Commentary Synthetic Fuel Partnerships In April 2003, the Corporation acquired a 49.5 percent minority interest in a synthetic fuel partnership. In October 2004, the Corporation acquired a 49 percent minority interest in an additional synthetic fuel partnership. These partnerships are variable interest entities that are subject to the requirements of FIN 46 (Revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB 51, (FIN 46R). Although these partnerships are variable interest entities (VIEs), the Corporation is not the primary beneficiary, and the entities have not been consolidated. Synthetic fuel produced by the partnerships is eligible for synthetic fuel tax credits through 2007. The production of synthetic fuel results in pretax losses. In 2004 and 2003, these pretax losses totaled $158.4 million and $105.5 million, respectively, and are reported as nonoperating expense on the Corporations 25 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) income statement. The synthetic fuel tax credits, as well as tax deductions for the nonoperating losses, reduce the Corporations income tax expense. In 2004 and 2003, the Corporations participation in the synthetic fuel partnership resulted in $144.4 million and $94.1 million of tax credits, respectively, and the nonoperating losses generated an additional $55.4 million and $37.2 million, respectively, of tax benefits, which combined to reduce the Corporations income tax provision by $199.8 million and $131.3 million, respectively. The effect of these benefits increased net income by $41.4 million, $.08 per share in 2004 and $25.8 million, $.05 per share in 2003. The effects of these tax credits are shown separately in the Corporations reconciliation of the U.S. statutory rate to its effective income tax rate in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Because the partnerships have received favorable private letter rulings from the IRS and because the partnerships test procedures conform to IRS guidance, the Corporations loss exposure under the synthetic fuel partnerships is minimal. 2004 versus 2003 Interest expense decreased primarily because of a lower average level of debt, partially offset by higher interest rates. The Corporations effective income tax rate was 22.0 percent in 2004 compared with 23.3 percent in 2003. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to the incremental benefits from the synthetic fuel partnership entered into in 2004. The Corporations share of net income of equity affiliates increased $17.8 million from 2003 primarily due to higher earnings at Kimberly Clark de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. (KCM). KCMs results were boosted by a sales gain of more than 10 percent, with continued double digit volume growth in its consumer businesses and higher selling prices. Minority owners share of subsidiaries net income increased $18.3 million primarily due to higher returns on the preferred securities held by the minority interest in the Corporations consolidated foreign financing subsidiary (as described below under Financing Commentary). Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes decreased 41.1 percent due to transaction costs for the Spin off and to a lesser extent because 2004 includes 11 months results versus 12 months in 2003 as the Spin off occurred on November 30, 2004. As a result of the Corporations share repurchase program, the average number of common shares outstanding declined, which benefited 2004 results by $.07 per share. 2003 versus 2002 Interest expense decreased primarily due to lower interest rates, partially offset by a higher average level of debt. The Corporations effective income tax rate was 23.3 percent in 2003 compared with 28.6 percent in 2002. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to the benefits from the synthetic fuel partnership described above. The Corporations share of net income of equity affiliates was $107.0 million in 2003 compared with $113.3 million in 2002. The decrease was primarily due to lower earnings at Kimberly Clark de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. (KCM) primarily because of depreciation in the value of the peso. KCMs operating profit benefited from higher sales volumes of about 6 percent and cost savings programs. However, these positive factors could not overcome higher fiber and other materials costs and negative currency effects. 26 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) Minority owners share of subsidiaries net income decreased 4.3 percent primarily due to Kimberly Clark Australia Pty. Ltd. becoming a wholly owned subsidiary on June 30, 2002. Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes decreased 13.7 percent primarily because of lower unit sales volumes and higher fiber costs. As a result of the Corporations share repurchase program, the average number of common shares outstanding declined, which benefited 2003 results by $.07 per share. Liquidity and Capital Resources Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 (Millions of dollars) Cash provided by operations $ 2,726.2 $ 2,552.2 Capital spending 535.0 872.9 Acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired 258.5 Ratio of total debt and preferred securities to capital (a) 37.7 % 37.1 % Pretax interest coverage times 11.5 11.2 (a) Capital is total debt and preferred securities plus stockholders equity and minority owners interest in subsidiaries. Cash Flow Commentary: Cash provided by operations increased $174.0 million or 6.8 percent to a record $2.7 billion reflecting the higher level of net income and noncash charges included in net income. In 2004, the Corporation contributed $200 million to its pension plan trusts compared with $181.9 million in 2003. The significant level of cash provided by operations in 2004 allowed the Corporation to make a contribution of $100 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan in December 2004, which had originally been planned for 2005. While the Corporation is not required to make a contribution in 2005 to the U.S. plan, the benefit of an additional contribution will be evaluated. About $38 million will be contributed to plans outside the U.S. in 2005. Contractual Obligations: The following table presents the Corporations total contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed or determinable. Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010+ (Millions of dollars) Contractual obligations Long term debt $ 2,883 $ 585 $ 65 $ 337 $ 20 $ 5 $ 1,871 Interest payments on long term debt 1,255 149 120 116 92 91 687 Operating leases 240 76 57 32 22 17 36 Unconditional purchase obligations 2,024 488 364 312 242 200 418 Open purchase orders 1,084 1,084 Total contractual obligations $ 7,486 $ 2,382 $ 606 $ 797 $ 376 $ 313 $ 3,012 27 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) Obligations Commentary: The unconditional purchase obligations are for the purchase of raw materials, primarily pulp (including the new long term pulp agreement with Neenah Paper), and utilities, principally electricity. Although the Corporation is primarily liable for payments on the above operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations, based on historic operating performance and forecasted future cash flows, management believes the Corporations exposure to losses, if any, under these arrangements is not material. The open purchase orders displayed in the table represent amounts the Corporation anticipates will become payable within the next year for goods and services it has negotiated for delivery. The above table does not include future payments that the Corporation will make for other postretirement benefit obligations. Those amounts are estimated using actuarial assumptions, including expected future service, to project the future obligations. Based upon those projections, the Corporation anticipates making payments for these obligations within a range from approximately $80 million in 2005 to more than $90 million by 2014. The table also does not include anticipated payments related to the synthetic fuel partnerships. Such payments will only be made if the partnerships produce synthetic fuel in future years. The Corporation estimates that it will make payments to these partnerships of approximately $160 million in 2005, 2006 and 2007, and will receive income tax benefits and credits in excess of these amounts. Deferred taxes, minority interest and payments related to pension plans are also not included in the table. A consolidated financing subsidiary has issued preferred securities that are in substance perpetual and are callable by the subsidiary in November 2008 and each 20 year anniversary thereafter. Management currently anticipates that these securities will not be called in November 2008, the next call date, and therefore they are not included in the above table (see Financing Commentary below and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail regarding these securities). Investing Commentary: During 2004, the Corporations capital spending of $535.0 million, which is equal to 3.5 percent of net sales, was below the long term targeted range of 5 percent to 6 percent of net sales. The lower level of spending in 2004 resulted from productivity gains and success in leveraging the global scale of existing production capacity. Management believes the capital spending target range of 5 percent to 6 percent is appropriate. The net increase in time deposits in 2003 was primarily attributable to investment of cash accumulated in Korea. Financing Commentary: At December 31, 2004, total debt and preferred securities was $4.2 billion, the same as the prior year end. There were no changes in the Corporations credit ratings in 2004. In July 2003, Standard & Poors (S&P) revised the Corporations credit rating for long term debt from AA to AA . Moodys Investor Service maintained its short and long term ratings but changed the Corporations outlook to negative from stable, indicating that a ratings downgrade could be possible. These changes were primarily based on the Corporations business performance in the heightened competitive environment and because S&P changed the way in which it evaluates liabilities for pensions and other postretirement benefits. 28 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) Management believes that these actions will not have a material adverse effect on the Corporations access to credit or its borrowing costs since these credit ratings remain strong. The Corporations commercial paper continues to be rated in the top category. At December 31, 2004, the Corporation had $1.2 billion of revolving credit facilities. These facilities, unused at December 31, 2004, permit borrowing at competitive interest rates and are available for general corporate purposes, including backup for commercial paper borrowings. The Corporation pays commitment fees on the unused portion but may cancel the facilities without penalty at any time prior to their expiration. Of these facilities, $600 million expires in September 2005 and the balance expires in November 2009. The Corporation anticipates that these facilities will be renewed when they expire. In February 2001, the Corporation formed a Luxembourg based financing subsidiary. The subsidiary issued 1 million shares of voting preferred securities with an aggregate par value of $520 million to a nonaffiliated entity for cash proceeds of $516.5 million. In June 2004, the nonaffiliated entity invested an additional $125 million, increasing the aggregate par value of the voting preferred securities held by the nonaffiliated entity (the Securities). In conjunction with this transaction, the fixed annual rate of return on the Securities was increased from 4.47 percent to 4.56 percent. Approximately 97 percent of these funds were loaned to the Corporation which used them to reduce its outstanding commercial paper. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. For the full year 2004, the Corporation repurchased approximately 24.8 million shares of its common stock at a cost of about $1.6 billion, including 6.8 million shares repurchased during the fourth quarter at a cost of approximately $429 million. The monthly detail of share repurchases for the fourth quarter of 2004 is included in Part II Item 5 of this Form 10 K. On June 8, 2004, the Corporations board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 25 million shares of the Corporations common stock during the next several years. Management believes that the Corporations ability to generate cash from operations and its capacity to issue short term and long term debt are adequate to fund working capital, capital spending, payment of dividends, repurchases of common stock and other needs in the foreseeable future. Variable Interest Entities The Corporation has variable interests in the following financing and real estate entities and in the synthetic fuel partnerships described above. Financing Entities The Corporation holds a significant variable interest in two financing entities that were used to monetize long term notes received from the sale of certain nonstrategic timberlands and related assets, which were sold in 1999 and 1989 to nonaffiliated buyers. These transactions qualified for the installment method of accounting for income tax purposes and met the criteria for immediate profit recognition for financial reporting purposes contained in SFAS 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate. These sales involved notes receivable with an aggregate face value of $617 million and a fair value of approximately $593 million at the date of sale. The notes receivable are backed by irrevocable standby letters of credit issued by money center banks, which aggregated $617 million at December 31, 2004. Because the Corporation desired to monetize the $617 million of notes receivable and continue the deferral of current income taxes on the gains, in 1999 the Corporation transferred the notes received from the 1999 sale to a noncontrolled financing entity, and in 2000 it transferred the notes received from the 1989 sale to another noncontrolled financing entity. The Corporation has minority voting interests in each of the financing entities 29 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) (collectively, the Financing Entities). The transfers of the notes and certain other assets to the Financing Entities were made at fair value, were accounted for as asset sales and resulted in no gain or loss. In conjunction with the transfer of the notes and other assets, the Financing Entities became obligated for $617 million in third party debt financing. A nonaffiliated financial institution has made substantive capital investments in each of the Financing Entities, has majority voting control over them and has substantive risks and rewards of ownership of the assets in the Financing Entities. The Corporation also contributed intercompany notes receivable aggregating $662 million and intercompany preferred stock of $50 million to the Financing Entities, which serve as secondary collateral for the third party lending arrangements. In the unlikely event of default by both of the money center banks that provided the irrevocable standby letters of credit, the Corporation could experience a maximum loss of $617 million under these arrangements. The Corporation has not consolidated the Financing Entities because it is not the primary beneficiary of either entity. Rather, it will continue to account for its ownership interests in these entities using the equity method of accounting. The Corporation retains equity interests in the Financing Entities for which the legal right of offset exists against the intercompany notes. As a result, the intercompany notes payable have been offset against the Corporations equity interests in the Financing Entities for financial reporting purposes. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Corporations Luxembourg based financing subsidiary, which is consolidated because the Corporation is the primary beneficiary of the entity. Real Estate Entities Effective March 31, 2004, the Corporation adopted FIN 46R for its real estate entities described below. In 1994, the Corporation began participating in the U.S. affordable and historic renovation real estate markets. Investments in these markets are encouraged by laws enacted by the United States Congress and related federal income tax rules and regulations. Accordingly, these investments generate income tax credits and tax losses that are used to reduce the Corporations income tax liabilities. The Corporation has invested in these markets through (i) partnership arrangements in which it is a limited partner, (ii) limited liability companies (LLCs) in which it is a nonmanaging member and (iii) investments in various funds in which the Corporation is one of many noncontrolling investors. These entities borrow money from third parties generally on a nonrecourse basis and invest in and own various real estate projects. Adoption of FIN 46R required the Corporation to consolidate ten apartment projects and two hotels because it was the primary beneficiary of each of these real estate ventures. The carrying amount of the assets that serve as collateral for $98.4 million of obligations of these ventures was $147.5 million at December 31, 2004, and these assets are classified as property, plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet. The Corporation also has guaranteed $14.6 million of the obligations of these ventures. The Corporation accounts for its interests in real estate entities that are not consolidated under FIN 46R by the equity method of accounting or by the effective yield method, as appropriate, and has accounted for the related income tax credits and other tax benefits as a reduction in its income tax provision. As of December 31, 2004, the Corporation had a net equity of $21.2 million in its nonconsolidated real estate entities. The Corporation has earned income tax credits totaling approximately $71.8 million, $59.3 million and $49.9 million for December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. As of December 31, 2004, total permanent financing debt for the nonconsolidated entities was $221.9 million. A total of $7.6 million of the permanent financing debt is guaranteed by the Corporation and the remainder of this debt is not supported or guaranteed by the Corporation. Except for the guaranteed portion, permanent financing debt is secured solely by the properties and is nonrecourse to the Corporation. From time to time, temporary interim financing is guaranteed by the 30 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) Corporation. In general, the Corporations interim financing guarantees are eliminated at the time permanent financing is obtained. At December 31, 2004, $27.9 million of temporary interim financing associated with these nonconsolidated real estate entities was guaranteed by the Corporation. If the Corporations investments in its nonconsolidated real estate entities were to be disposed of at their carrying amounts, a portion of the tax credits may be recaptured and may result in a charge to earnings. As of December 31, 2004, this recapture risk is estimated to be $31.1 million. The Corporation has no current intention of disposing of these investments during the recapture period, nor does it anticipate the need to do so in the foreseeable future in order to satisfy any anticipated liquidity need. Accordingly, the recapture risk is considered to be remote. At December 31, 2004, the Corporations maximum loss exposure for its nonconsolidated real estate entities is estimated to be $87.8 million and was comprised of its net equity in these entities of $21.2 million, its permanent financing guarantees of $7.6 million, its interim financing guarantees of $27.9 million and the income tax credit recapture risk of $31.1 million. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates, and changes in these estimates are recorded when known. The critical accounting policies used by management in the preparation of the Corporations consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of the Corporations financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used. The critical judgments by management relate to consumer and trade promotion and rebate accruals, pension benefits, retained insurable risks, excess and obsolete inventory, allowance for doubtful accounts, useful lives for depreciation and amortization, future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill and long lived assets and for determining the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities, deferred tax assets and potential income tax assessments, and contingencies. The Corporations critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Promotion and Rebate Accruals Among those factors affecting the accruals for promotions are estimates of the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed and the type and number of activities within promotional programs between the Corporation and its trade customers. Rebate accruals are based on estimates of the quantity of products distributors have sold to specific customers. Generally, the estimates for consumer coupon costs are based on historical patterns of coupon redemption, influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories. Estimates of trade promotion liabilities for promotional program costs incurred, but unpaid, are generally based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales, timing of promotional activities and forecasted costs for activities within the promotional programs. Settlement of these liabilities sometimes occurs in periods subsequent to the date of the promotion activity. Trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees, cooperative marketing programs, temporary price reductions, favorable end of aisle or in store product displays and other activities conducted by the customers to promote the Corporations products. Promotion accruals as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 were $263.3 million and $222.0 million, respectively. Rebate accruals as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 were $163.0 million and $136.4 million, respectively. 31 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) Pension Benefits The Corporation and its subsidiaries in North America and the United Kingdom have defined benefit pension plans (the Principal Plans) and or defined contribution retirement plans covering substantially all regular employees. Certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or, in certain countries, termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees. The funding policy for the qualified defined benefit plans in North America and the defined benefit plans in the United Kingdom is to contribute assets to fully fund the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO). Subject to regulatory and tax deductibility limits, any funding shortfall will be eliminated over a reasonable number of years. Nonqualified U.S. plans providing pension benefits in excess of limitations imposed by the U.S. income tax code are not funded. Funding for the remaining defined benefit plans outside the U.S. is based on legal requirements, tax considerations, investment opportunities, and customary business practices in such countries. Consolidated pension expense for defined benefit pension plans was $154.8 million in 2004 compared with $165.9 million for 2003. Pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions applied to each of the defined benefit plans. The weighted average expected long term rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense was 8.32 percent in 2004 compared with 8.42 percent in 2003 and will be 8.29 percent in 2005. The expected long term rate of return on pension fund assets was determined based on several factors, including input from our pension investment consultants and projected long term returns of broad equity and bond indices. We also considered our U.S. plans historical 10 year and 15 year compounded annual returns of 10.92 percent and 9.66 percent, respectively, which have been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices. We anticipate that on average the investment managers for each of the plans comprising the Principal Plans will generate annual long term rates of return of at least 8.5 percent. Our expected long term rate of return on the assets in the Principal Plans is based on an asset allocation assumption of about 70 percent with equity managers, with expected long term rates of return of approximately 10 percent, and 30 percent with fixed income managers, with an expected long term rate of return of about 6 percent. We regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Also, when deemed appropriate, we execute hedging strategies using index options and futures to limit the downside exposure of certain investments by trading off upside potential above an acceptable level. We executed such hedging strategies in 2003 and 2002. No hedging instruments are currently in place. We will continue to evaluate our long term rate of return assumptions at least annually and will adjust them as necessary. We determine pension expense on the fair value of assets rather than a calculated value that averages gains and losses (Calculated Value) over a period of years. Investment gains or losses represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the fair value of assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets. We recognize the variance between actual and expected gains and losses on pension assets in pension expense more rapidly than we would if we used a Calculated Value for plan assets. As of December 31, 2004, the Principal Plans had cumulative unrecognized investment losses and other actuarial losses of approximately $1.7 billion. These unrecognized net losses may increase our future pension expense if not offset by (i) actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns, or (ii) other factors, including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate our pension obligations, or (iii) other actuarial gains, including whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the corridor determined under SFAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions. The discount (or settlement) rate we used to determine the present value of our future U.S. pension obligations at December 31, 2004 was based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with maturities ranging from 1 year to 30 years. Each years expected future benefit payments were discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate thereby generating the overall discount rate for our U.S. pension obligations. For our non U.S. Principal Plans, we established discount rates 32 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) using the long term local government bond rates increased by the interest rate spread between the U.S. discount rate and long term U.S. government bond rates. The weighted average discount rate for the Principal Plans decreased to 5.77 percent at December 31, 2004 from 5.97 percent at December 31, 2003. We estimate that our consolidated pension expense will approximate $160 million in 2005. This estimate reflects the effect of the actuarial losses and is based on an expected weighted average long term rate of return on assets in the Principal Plans of 8.50 percent, a weighted average discount rate for the Principal Plans of 5.77 percent and various other assumptions. Pension expense beyond 2005 will depend on future investment performance, the Corporations contributions to the pension trusts, changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans. If the expected long term rate of return on assets for our Principal Plans was lowered by 0.25 percent, our annual pension expense would increase by approximately $9 million. If the discount rate assumptions for these same plans were reduced by 0.25 percent, our annual pension expense would increase by approximately $13 million and our December 31, 2004 minimum pension liability would increase by about $147 million. The fair value of the assets in our defined benefit plans was $4.0 billion at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003. Lower discount rates have caused the projected benefit obligations (the PBO) of the defined benefit plans to exceed the fair value of plan assets by approximately $1.2 billion at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003. Primarily due to the lower discount rates, the ABO of our defined benefit plans exceeded plan assets by about $.9 billion at the end of 2004. At the end of 2003, the ABO exceeded the fair value of plan assets by about $.8 billion. On a consolidated basis, the Corporation contributed about $200 million to pension trusts in 2004 compared with $181.9 million in 2003. In addition, the Corporation made direct benefit payments of $21.4 million in 2004 compared to $29.7 million in 2003. While the Corporation is not required to make a contribution in 2005 to the U.S. plan, the benefit of a contribution will be evaluated. About $38 million will be contributed to plans outside the U.S. in 2005. The discount rate used for each countrys pension obligation is identical to the discount rate used for that countrys other postretirement obligation. The discount rates displayed for the two types of obligations for the Corporations consolidated operations may appear different due to the weighting used in the calculation of the two weighted average discount rates. Retained Insurable Risks We retain selected insurable risks, primarily related to property damage, workers compensation, and product, automobile and premises liability based upon historical loss patterns and managements judgment of cost effective risk retention. Accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported events, principally related to workers compensation and automobile liability, are based upon loss development factors provided to us by our external insurance brokers. Excess and Obsolete Inventory We require all excess, obsolete, damaged or off quality inventories including raw materials, in process, finished goods, and spare parts to be adequately reserved for or to be disposed of. Our process requires an ongoing tracking of the aging of inventories to be reviewed in conjunction with current marketing plans to ensure that any excess or obsolete inventories are identified on a timely basis. This process requires judgments be made about the salability of existing stock in relation to sales projections. The evaluation of the adequacy of provision for obsolete and excess inventories is performed on at least a quarterly basis. No provisions for future obsolescence, damage or off quality inventories are made. 33 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts that represents our best estimate of the accounts receivable that will not be collected. We base our estimate on, among other things, historical collection experience, a review of the current aging status of customer receivables, and a review of specific information for those customers that are deemed to be higher risk. When we become aware of a customer whose continued operating success is questionable, we closely monitor collection of their receivable balance and may require the customer to prepay for current shipments. If a customer enters a bankruptcy action, we monitor the progress of that action to determine when and if an additional provision for non collectibility is warranted. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on at least a quarterly basis. The allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $42.5 million and $47.9 million, respectively, and our write off of uncollectible accounts was $13.6 million and $15.5 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Property and Depreciation Estimating the useful lives of property, plant and equipment requires the exercise of management judgment, and actual lives may differ from these estimates. Changes to these initial useful life estimates are made when appropriate. Property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment in accordance with SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such long lived assets may not be recoverable from future net pretax cash flows. Impairment testing requires significant management judgment including estimating the future success of product lines, future sales volumes, growth rates for selling prices and costs, alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets. Impairment testing is conducted at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured and are independent of cash flows of other assets. An asset impairment would be indicated if the sum of the expected future net pretax cash flows from the use of the asset (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss would be measured based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount. We determine fair value based on an expected present value technique in which multiple cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes and a risk free rate of interest are used to estimate fair value. The estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis are consistent with the business plans and estimates we use to manage our business operations and to make acquisition and divestiture decisions. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and would increase or decrease the impairment charge. Actual outcomes may differ from the estimates. For example, if our products fail to achieve volume and pricing estimates or if market conditions change or other significant estimates are not realized, then our revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved, and we may be required to recognize additional impairment charges. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We test the carrying amount of goodwill annually as of the beginning of the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Impairment testing is performed in accordance with SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Impairment testing is conducted at the operating segment level of our businesses and is based on a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of each operating segment. The determination of fair value requires significant management judgment including estimating future sales volumes, growth rates of selling prices and costs, changes in working capital, investments in property and equipment and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. We also test the sensitivities of these fair value estimates to changes in our growth assumptions of sales volumes, selling prices and costs. If the carrying amount of an operating segment that contains goodwill exceeds fair value, a possible 34 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) impairment would be indicated. If a possible impairment is indicated, we would estimate the implied fair value of goodwill by comparing the carrying amount of the net assets of the unit excluding goodwill to the total fair value of the unit. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment charge would be recorded. We also use judgment in assessing whether we need to test more frequently for impairment than annually. Factors such as unexpected adverse economic conditions, competition, product changes and other external events may require more frequent assessments. We have completed our annual goodwill impairment testing and have determined that none of our $2.7 billion of goodwill is impaired. We have no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. We have other intangible assets with a gross carrying amount of approximately $276 million and a net carrying amount of about $185 million. These intangibles are being amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss would be indicated. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the intangible asset over its discounted future cash flows. We use judgment in assessing whether the carrying amount of our intangible assets is not expected to be recoverable over their estimated remaining useful lives. The factors considered are similar to those outlined in the goodwill impairment discussion above. Primary Beneficiary Determination of Variable Interest Entities The determination of the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities under FIN 46R requires estimating the probable future cash flows of each VIE using a computer simulation model, determining the variability of such cash flows and their present values. Estimating the probable future cash flows of each VIE requires the exercise of significant management judgment. The resulting present values are then allocated to the various participants in each VIE in accordance with their beneficial interests. The participant that is allocated the majority of the present value of the variability is the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE under FIN 46R. Deferred Income Taxes and Potential Assessments As of December 31, 2004, the Corporation has recorded deferred tax assets related to income tax loss carryforwards and income tax credit carryforwards totaling $519.5 million and has established valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets of $252.4 million, thereby resulting in a net deferred tax asset of $267.1 million. As of December 31, 2003, the net deferred tax asset was $220.1 million. These income tax losses and credits are in non U.S. taxing jurisdictions and in certain states within the U.S. In determining the valuation allowances to establish against these deferred tax assets, the Corporation considers many factors, including the specific taxing jurisdiction, the carryforward period, income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, the Corporation concludes that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. As of December 31, 2004, United States income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately $4.0 billion of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries operating outside the U.S. in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion 23, Accounting for Income Taxes, Special Areas. These earnings are considered by management to be invested indefinitely. However, they would be subject to income tax if they were remitted as dividends, were lent to the Corporation or a U.S. affiliate, or if the Corporation were to sell its stock in the subsidiaries. It is not practicable to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability on these unremitted earnings. We periodically determine whether our non U.S. subsidiaries will invest their undistributed earnings indefinitely and reassess this determination as appropriate. The 35 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) Corporation currently is evaluating the effect of the American Jobs Creation Act on the unremitted earnings of its non U.S. subsidiaries and expects to complete that evaluation by June 30, 2005. At this time, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the amount of unremitted earnings that may be repatriated and the income tax effects of such repatriation. The Corporation records liabilities in current income taxes for potential assessments. The accruals relate to uncertain tax positions in a variety of taxing jurisdictions and are based on what management believes will be the ultimate resolution of these positions. These liabilities may be affected by changing interpretations of laws, rulings by tax authorities, or the expiration of the statute of limitations. The Corporations U.S. federal income tax returns have been audited through 2001. IRS assessments of additional taxes have been paid through 1998. Refund actions are pending in Federal District Court or the IRS Appeals Office for the years 1987 through 1998. Management currently believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material effect on the Corporations business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Contingencies and Legal Matters Litigation The following is a brief description of certain legal and administrative proceedings to which the Corporation or its subsidiaries is a party or to which the Corporations or its subsidiaries properties are subject. In managements opinion, none of the legal and administrative proceedings described below, individually or in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on the Corporations business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. As of December 31, 2004, the Corporation, along with many other nonaffiliated companies, was a party to lawsuits with allegations of personal injury resulting from asbestos exposure on the defendants premises and allegations that the defendants manufactured, sold, distributed or installed products which cause asbestos related lung disease. These general allegations are often made against the Corporation without any apparent evidence or identification of a specific product or premises of the Corporation. The Corporation has denied the allegations and raised numerous defenses in all of these asbestos cases. All asbestos claims have been tendered to the Corporations insurance carriers for defense and indemnity. The financial statements reflect appropriate accruals for the Corporations portion of the costs estimated to be incurred in connection with resolving these claims. Contingency One of the Corporations North American tissue mills has an agreement to provide its local utility company a specified amount of electric power for each of the next 12 years. In the event that the mill was shut down, the Corporation would be required to continue to operate the power generation facility on behalf of its owner, the local utility company. The net present value of the cost to fulfill this agreement as of December 31, 2004 is estimated to be approximately $120 million. Management considers the probability of closure of this mill to be remote. Environmental Matters The Corporation has been named a potentially responsible party under the provisions of the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or analogous state statutes, at a number of waste disposal sites, none of which, individually or in the aggregate, in managements opinion, is likely to have a material adverse effect on the Corporations business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 36 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) New Accounting Standards In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 151, Inventory Costs an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS 151 clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expenses, freight, handling costs, and spoilage. It also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory be based on the normal capacity of production facilities. SFAS 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. Adoption of SFAS 151 will not have a material effect on the Corporations financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R), which revises SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. SFAS 123R also supersedes APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends SFAS 95, Statement of Cash Flows. In general, the accounting required by SFAS 123R is similar to that of SFAS 123. However, SFAS 123 gave companies a choice to either recognize the fair value of stock options in their income statements or to disclose the pro forma income statement effect of the fair value of stock options in the notes to the financial statements. SFAS 123R eliminates that choice and requires the fair value of all share based payments to employees, including the fair value of grants of employee stock options, be recognized in the income statement, generally over the option vesting period. SFAS 123R must be adopted no later than July 1, 2005. Early adoption is permitted. SFAS 123R permits adoption of its requirements using one of two transition methods: 1. A modified prospective transition (MPT) method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date (a) for all share based payments granted after the effective date and (b) for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that remain unvested on the effective date. 2. A modified retrospective transition (MRT) method which includes the requirements of the MPT method described above, but also permits restatement of financial statements based on the amounts previously disclosed under SFAS 123s pro forma disclosure requirements either for (a) all prior periods presented or (b) prior interim periods of the year of adoption. The Corporation is currently evaluating the timing and manner in which it will adopt SFAS 123R. As permitted by SFAS 123, the Corporation currently accounts for share based payments to employees using APB 25s intrinsic value method and, as such, has recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, adoption of SFAS 123Rs fair value method will have a slight effect on results of operations, although it will have no impact on overall financial position. The impact of adoption of SFAS 123R cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future. However, had SFAS 123R been adopted in prior periods, the effect would have approximated the SFAS 123 pro forma net income and earnings per share disclosures shown in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. SFAS 123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required, thereby reducing net operating cash flows and increasing net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. While those amounts cannot be estimated for future periods (because they depend on, among other things, when employees will exercise the stock options and the market price of the Corporations stock at the time of exercise), the amount of operating cash flows generated in prior periods for such excess tax deductions was $30.9 million, $7.4 million and $9.9 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Business Outlook For 2005, the Corporation is targeting sales growth of 3 to 5 percent, consistent with its long term objective. Based on plans to drive innovation, the gain is expected to come largely from improvement in sales volumes, 37 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) with price, mix and currency assumed to be about flat. The Corporation is targeting to deliver $150 million in cost savings, which should help improve operating profit margin by up to 20 basis points despite inflationary cost increases. The Corporation expects to deliver earnings of $3.70 to $3.85 per share for the year, representing mid to high single digit growth compared with net income from continuing operations of $3.55 in 2004. Cash flow is expected to continue to be strong which will enable the Corporation to again return a significant amount of cash to shareholders in 2005. Common share repurchases are currently targeted to be at least $1 billion during the year and dividends on common stock have been increased by 12.5 percent effective with the April payment. Capital spending is estimated to be $800 million in 2005, which should be toward the low end of the Corporations long term target of 5 to 6 percent of net sales. For the first quarter of 2005, earnings are expected to be in a range of 92 to 94 cents per share compared with earnings per share from continuing operations of 88 cents in 2004. This would represent growth of approximately 5 to 7 percent, similar to the expected level of improvement for the full year. The Corporation is planning to step up its marketing spending in the quarter compared with the prior year to support a very active schedule of product launches, including Huggies toiletries, new Pull Ups training pants with Wetness Indicators and Scott Extra Soft bathroom tissue. The Corporation also expects to face continued cost increases in the first quarter, particularly for fiber as well as resin and other oil based materials. Information Concerning Forward Looking Statements Certain matters discussed in this report concerning, among other things, the business outlook, including new product introductions, cost savings, anticipated financial and operating results, strategies, contingencies and contemplated transactions of the Corporation, constitute forward looking statements and are based upon managements expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting the Corporation. There can be no assurance that these events will occur or that the Corporations results will be as estimated. The assumptions used as a basis for the forward looking statements include many estimates that, among other things, depend on the achievement of future cost savings and projected volume increases. In addition, many factors outside the control of the Corporation, including the prices and availability of the Corporations raw materials, potential competitive pressures on selling prices or advertising and promotion expenses for the Corporations products, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as general economic conditions in the markets in which the Corporation does business, also could impact the realization of such estimates. For a description of these and other factors that could cause the Corporations future results to differ materially from those expressed in any such forward looking statements, see Item I of this Annual Report on Form 10 K entitled Factors That May Affect Future Results. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a multinational enterprise, the Corporation is exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. A variety of practices are employed to manage these risks, including operating and financing activities and, where deemed appropriate, the use of derivative instruments. Derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation or trading. All foreign currency derivative instruments are either exchange traded or are entered into with major financial institutions. The Corporations credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to these agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date. Credit risk with respect to the counterparties is considered minimal in view of the financial strength of the counterparties. 38 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) Presented below is a description of our most significant risks (foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and commodity price risk) together with a sensitivity analysis, performed annually, of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices. These analyses reflect our view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a one year period. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is managed by the systematic use of foreign currency forward, option and swap contracts. The use of these instruments allows management of transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset, in whole or in part, losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure. Prior to 2004, foreign currency risk was managed by the selective, rather than the systematic, use of foreign currency forward, option and swap contracts. Management does not foresee or expect any significant change in its foreign currency risk exposures or in the strategies it employs to manage them in the near future. Foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We perform an annual test to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on our annual operating profit based on the foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures of the Corporation and its foreign affiliates at the current year end. The balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliates net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the U.S. dollar. The results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph. As of December 31, 2004, a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in a net pretax loss of approximately $43 million. These hypothetical losses on transactional exposures are based on the difference between the December 31, 2004 rates and the assumed rates. In the view of management, the above hypothetical losses resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the Corporations consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The translation of the balance sheets of our non U.S. operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Consequently, we perform an annual test to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of our non U.S. operations into U.S. dollars. These translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments (UTA) within stockholders equity. The hypothetical increase in UTA is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these non U.S. operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates. The results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph. As of December 31, 2004, a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the prevailing market rates of our foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced stockholders equity by approximately $638 million. These hypothetical adjustments in UTA are based on the difference between the December 31, 2004 exchange rates and the assumed rates. In the view of management, the above UTA adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the Corporations consolidated financial position. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable and fixed rate debt composed of short and long term instruments. The objective is to maintain a cost effective mix that management 39 Table of Contents PART II (Continued) deems appropriate. At December 31, 2004, the debt portfolio was composed of approximately 35 percent variable rate debt and 65 percent fixed rate debt. The strategy employed to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations consists primarily of a target mix of fixed and floating rate debt. The Corporations target for variable rate debt is 40 percent to 50 percent and is designed to balance the Corporations cost of financing with its interest rate risk. We perform two separate tests to determine whether changes in interest rates would have a significant effect on our financial position or future results of operations. Both tests are based on our consolidated debt levels at the time of the test. The first test estimates the effect of interest rate changes on our fixed rate debt. Interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of fixed rate debt due to differences between the current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments. With respect to fixed rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2004, a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixed rate debt by about $110 million. The second test estimates the potential effect on future pretax income that would result from increased interest rates applied to our current level of variable rate debt. With respect to commercial paper and other variable rate debt, a 10 percent increase in interest rates would not have had a material effect on the future results of operations or cash flows. Commodity Price Risk The Corporation is subject to commodity price risk, the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp. Selling prices of tissue products are influenced, in part, by the market price for pulp, which is determined by industry supply and demand. On a worldwide basis prior to the Spin off, the Corporation supplied approximately 40 percent of its virgin fiber needs from internal pulp manufacturing operations. The Spin off has reduced the internal pulp supply to approximately 10 percent. As previously discussed under Factors That May Affect Future Results, increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. Derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks. In addition, the Corporation is subject to price risk for utilities, primarily natural gas, which are used in its manufacturing operations. Derivative instruments are used to hedge a portion of this risk when it is deemed prudent to do so by management. Management does not believe that these risks are material to the Corporations business or its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 40 Table of Contents PART II (Continued)
