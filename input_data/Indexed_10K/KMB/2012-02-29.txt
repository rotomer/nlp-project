ITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Introduction This MD&A is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our past performance, current financial condition and future prospects. The following will be discussed and analyzed:Overview of BusinessOverview of 2011 ResultsResults of Operations and Related InformationLiquidity and Capital ResourcesVariable Interest EntitiesCritical Accounting Policies and Use of EstimatesLegal MattersNew Accounting StandardsBusiness OutlookForward Looking Statements Overview of Business We are a global company focused on leading the world in essentials for a better life, with manufacturing facilities in 36 countries and products sold in more than 175 countries. Our products are sold under well known brands such as Kleenex, Scott, Huggies, Pull Ups, Kotex and Depend. We have four reportable global business segments: Personal Care, Consumer Tissue, KC Professional ("KCP") & Other and Health Care. These global business segments are described in greater detail in Item 8, Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In operating our global business, we seek to:manage our portfolio to balance growth, profitability and cash flow, invest in our brands, innovation and growth initiatives, deliver sustainable cost reductions, and provide disciplined capital management to improve return on invested capital and return cash to shareholders. Key strategies for our segments include: We plan to grow our strong positions in Personal Care by leveraging our brands and providing innovations. For Consumer Tissue, we seek to bring differentiated, value added innovations to grow and strengthen our brands while focusing on net realized revenue, improving mix and reducing costs. We plan to continue to shift our mix to faster growing, higher margin segments within KCP and Health Care, including safety and wiping in KCP and medical devices in Health Care. We plan to drive growth throughout K C International ("KCI"), which includes our businesses in Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Africa, with a particular emphasis in China, Russia and Latin America. Our goals for KCI include seeking targeted expansion and growth, taking advantage of attractive market opportunities and deploying our strong brands and innovation capabilities. 12Table of ContentsPART II(Continued)Highlights for 2011 include the following:We launched a number of new or improved products, including Huggies Little Movers Slip On Diapers, Poise Hourglass Shape Pads, Kleenex Cool Touch Facial Tissue, U by Kotex Tweens and improved Cottenelle bathroom tissue. These innovations are the latest examples of our ability to translate consumer insights into solutions that generate growth.Our innovations and supporting marketing programs helped improve our brands market positions. In the U.S., we improved or maintained market share in the majority of our consumer categories. We also increased our market share in a number of businesses in KCI.We executed our growth strategies in KCI. Net sales grew at a double digit rate in 2011, including high single digit growth before taking into account the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. KCI accounted for about 36 percent of company sales in 2011, up 3 points from the previous year.We took steps to offset significant cost inflation. We achieved higher overall net selling prices of 2 percent, we delivered approximately $265 million in ongoing cost savings, and we tightly controlled overhead spending. These actions helped offset cost inflation of $580 million. As described in "Pulp and Tissues Restructuring" below, in January of 2011, we initiated a pulp and tissue restructuring to exit our remaining integrated pulp manufacturing operations and improve the underlying profitability and return on invested capital of our consumer tissue and KCP businesses. In January of 2012, we decided to streamline an additional facility in North America to further enhance the profitability of the consumer tissue business. Both restructuring actions are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2012. We repurchased $1.24 billion of Kimberly Clark common stock in 2011, and expect to repurchase $900 million to $1.1 billion of our common stock in 2012, subject to market conditions. In addition, we raised our dividend in 2011 by 6 percent, the 39th consecutive annual increase in our dividend. Altogether, share repurchases and dividends in 2011 amounted to $2.3 billion.We are subject to risks and uncertainties, which can affect our business operations and financial results. See Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Form 10 K for additional information. Overview of 2011 ResultsNet sales increased 5.6 percent due to favorable currency effects, increases in net selling prices and increases in volume. Operating profit decreased 11.9 percent and net income attributable to Kimberly Clark Corporation and diluted earnings per share decreased 13.7 percent and 10.3 percent, respectively. Results were negatively impacted by $415 million in pretax charges, $289 million after tax, for the pulp and tissue restructuring actions.Cash provided by operations was $2.3 billion, a decrease of 16.6 percent compared to last year, driven primarily by higher defined benefit pension plan contributions in 2011.13Table of ContentsPART II(Continued)Results of Operations and Related Information This section contains a discussion and analysis of net sales, operating profit and other information relevant to an understanding of 2011 results of operations. This discussion and analysis compares 2011 results to 2010, and 2010 results to 2009.

Volumes were essentially flat as improvements in baby wipes, adult incontinence products and feminine care, including benefits from product innovation in the Poise, Depend and U by Kotex brands, were mostly offset by lower sales of Huggies diapers and Pull Ups training pants. 14Table of ContentsPART II(Continued)In Europe, personal care net sales increased about 4 percent due to favorable currency effects of 5 percent and increases in sales volumes of 2 percent, partially offset by lower net selling prices of 2 percent. In KCI, personal care net sales increased about 14 percent, driven by increases in sales volumes of 5 percent, higher net selling prices of 5 percent, primarily in Latin America, and favorable currency effects of 5 percent. The growth in sales volumes was broad based, with particular strength in South Korea, China and Latin America, excluding Venezuela. Consumer tissue net sales in North America increased 2 percent due to higher net selling prices of 2 percent, partially offset by a sales volume decline of about 1 percent. Sales volumes were up high single digits in paper towels but were more than offset by low single digits decreases in both bath and facial tissue.In Europe, consumer tissue net sales increased 5 percent due to favorable currency effects of 6 percent, partially offset by a 1 percent decrease in sales volumes. In KCI, consumer tissue net sales increased 8 percent due to higher net selling prices of 7 percent, primarily in Latin America, favorable currency effects of 5 percent and improvements in product mix of 2 percent, partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes of 6 percent. Sales volumes were negatively impacted by revenue realization strategies and lost sales from a divestiture of a non core business in Latin America and exiting non strategic products in conjunction with the pulp and tissue restructuring actions. KCPs net sales in North America increased 3 percent due to higher net selling prices of 2 percent and an increase in sales volumes of 1 percent driven by the safety and wiper categories, while washroom product volumes declined in a continued challenging economic environment. In Europe, sales of KCP products increased 7 percent due to favorable currency effects of 6 percent and increased sales volumes of about 2 percent. Net sales in KCI of KCP products increased 14 percent due to favorable currency effects of 6 percent, higher sales volumes of 5 percent and higher net selling prices of 3 percent.Higher sales volumes for health care products were driven by increases in exam gloves and medical devices.

Sales volumes were down low single digits in bath tissue and double digits in paper towels, primarily as a result of continued consumer trade down to lower priced product offerings.In Europe, consumer tissue net sales decreased 2 percent due to unfavorable currency effects of 2 percent and a decrease in sales volumes of 2 percent, partially offset by an increase in net selling prices of 2 percent.In KCI, consumer tissue net sales increased about 8 percent due to an increase in net selling prices of 4 percent, favorable currency effects of 2 percent and improvements in product mix of 1 percent. Increases in net selling prices were broad based, with particular strength in Latin America and Russia. KCPs net sales in North America increased 3 percent due to higher net selling prices of about 2 percent and favorable currency effects of 1 percent. Volume comparisons benefited from the Jackson Products, Inc. acquisition in 2009 and growth in the wiper and safety categories, while washroom product volumes declined in a continued challenging economic environment. In Europe, sales of KCP products decreased 1 percent, as an increase in sales volumes of 3 percent was more than offset by unfavorable currency effects of 3 percent and lower net selling prices of 1 percent. The increased sales volumes for health care products were primarily due to a 9 percent benefit from the acquisition of I Flow Corporation ("I Flow") in late November 2009, as well as volume increases in other medical devices, which were more than offset by declines in supplies, including the impact from increased face mask demand in 2009 related to the H1N1 influenza virus.

The benefits of increases in net sales and cost savings of $265 million were more than offset by charges of $415 million related to the pulp and tissue restructuring, inflation in key cost inputs of $580 million and the negative effect of lower production volumes. Comparisons were also impacted by the effect of a $98 million charge related to the adoption of highly inflationary accounting in Venezuela in 2010. Operating profit for the personal care segment decreased due to inflation in key cost inputs and the negative effect of lower production volumes, partially offset by increases in net sales and cost savings. In North America, operating profit decreased due to inflation in key cost inputs, lower net sales and the negative effects of lower production volumes, partially offset by lower marketing, research and general expenses. In Europe, operating profit decreased due to inflation in key cost inputs, partially offset by cost savings, higher net sales and lower marketing, research and general expenses. Operating profit in KCI increased due to higher net sales, cost savings and favorable currency effects, partially offset by inflation in key cost inputs and increases in marketing, research and general expenses.Consumer tissue segment operating profit increased due to increases in net sales, cost savings and lower marketing, research and general expenses, partially offset by inflation in key cost inputs and the negative effect of lower production volumes. Operating profit in North America increased as higher net sales, cost savings and lower marketing, research and general expenses were partially offset by inflation in key cost inputs. In Europe, operating profit decreased as favorable currency effects, cost savings and lower general expenses were more than offset by inflation in key cost inputs. Operating profit in KCI increased as higher net sales and favorable currency effects were partially offset by the negative effect of production volumes and inflation in key cost inputs. Operating profit for KCP & Other increased due to higher net sales, cost savings and favorable currency effects, partially offset by inflation in key cost inputs and increased marketing, research and general expenses.Operating profit for the health care segment increased as higher net sales, cost savings and lower marketing, research and general expenses, primarily due to a lower level of litigation expenses, were partially offset by inflation in key cost inputs. Pulp and Tissue RestructuringOn January 21, 2011, we initiated a pulp and tissue restructuring plan in order to exit our remaining integrated pulp manufacturing operations and improve the underlying profitability and return on invested capital of our consumer tissue and KCP businesses. The restructuring involves the streamlining, sale or closure of six of our manufacturing facilities around the world. In conjunction with these actions, we have begun to exit certain non strategic products, primarily non branded offerings, and transfer some production to lower cost facilities in order to improve overall profitability and returns. Facilities impacted by the restructuring include a facility in Everett, Washington, two facilities in Australia and two facilities in Spain. In addition, in January of 2012, we decided to streamline an additional facility in North America to further enhance the profitability of the consumer tissue business. 17Table of ContentsPART II(Continued)Both restructuring actions are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2012. The restructuring actions are expected to result in cumulative charges of approximately $550 million to $600 million before tax ($385 million to $420 million after tax) over 2011 and 2012. Cash costs related to the streamlining of operations, sale or closure, relocation of equipment, severance and other expenses are expected to account for approximately 30 percent to 40 percent of the charges. Noncash charges will consist primarily of incremental depreciation.As a result of the restructuring activities, versus the 2010 baseline, we expect that by 2013 annual net sales will decrease by $250 million to $300 million, and operating profit will increase by at least $75 million in 2013 and $100 million in 2014. Most of the restructuring will impact the consumer tissue business segment. In 2011, we recognized benefits of $20 million from the restructuring actions.During 2011, $415 million of charges were recognized for the restructuring actions, including $407 million recorded in Cost of products sold, $6 million recorded in Marketing, research and general expenses, and $2 million recorded in Other (income) and expense, net. A related benefit of $126 million was recorded in Provision for income taxes. On a segment basis, $357 million and $56 million of the charges related to the consumer tissue and K C Professional & Other, respectively. On a geographic basis, $204 million of the charges were recorded in North America, $133 million in Australia, and $78 million elsewhere. Of the $415 million charges recorded in 2011, $329 million were non cash. Of the $86 million in cash charges, $51 million have been paid in 2011.For additional information on the pulp and tissue restructuring, see Item 8, Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Other (income) and expense, net Other (income) and expense, net for 2011 includes gains from the divestiture of a small non core business in Latin America and the sale of a venture investment in a health care start up company, as well as currency transaction gains of $27 million. Other (income) and expense, net for 2010 includes a $79 million charge related to the adoption of highly inflationary accounting in Venezuela and currency transaction losses of $20 million.Commentary: 2010 versus 2009 Percentage Change in Operating Profit Versus Prior Year Change Due To TotalChange Volume NetPrice InputCosts(a) CostSavings Currency Other(b)Consolidated(1.8) 2 8 (28) 13 3Personal Care1.4 3 2 (16) 11 (3) 4Consumer Tissue(10.3) (5) 21 (45) 13 (6) 12K C Professional & Other0.9 (6) 14 (31) 10 (3) 17Health Care(28.7) 29 (9) (19) 12 2 (44)(a) Includes inflation in raw materials, energy and distribution costs.(b) Includes the effect of the 2009 organization optimization initiative charges and related benefits.

The benefits of increases in net sales, cost savings of $370 million, and a decrease in pension expense of about $120 million, were more than offset by inflation in key cost inputs of about $790 million, and increased marketing, research and general expenses, which included higher strategic marketing spending of about $100 million, and increases related to I Flow and to support future growth in KCI. Comparisons were also impacted by the effect of the organization optimization initiative charges of $128 million in 2009 and related benefits in 2010, and a $98 million charge related to the adoption of highly inflationary accounting in Venezuela. Operating profit as a percent of net sales decreased to 14.0 percent from 14.8 percent in 2009.18Table of ContentsPART II(Continued)Operating profit for the personal care segment increased 1.4 percent as higher sales volumes, higher net selling prices, and cost savings were mostly offset by inflation in key cost inputs, increased marketing, research and general expenses and unfavorable currency effects. In North America, operating profit increased due to cost savings, higher net selling prices, increased sales volumes, and favorable currency effects, partially offset by inflation in key cost inputs and increased marketing expenses. In Europe, operating profit increased due to cost savings partially offset by inflation in key cost inputs and decreases in net selling prices. Operating profit in KCI decreased as higher sales volumes were more than offset by unfavorable currency effects, primarily in Venezuela, increases in marketing and general expenses and inflation in key cost inputs.Consumer tissue segment operating profit decreased 10.3 percent. Increases in net selling prices, cost savings and lower general expenses were more than offset by inflation in key cost inputs, unfavorable currency effects, lower sales volumes and higher marketing expenses. Operating profit in North America decreased as increases in net selling prices and cost savings were more than offset by inflation in key cost inputs, lower sales volumes and higher marketing expenses. In Europe, operating profit increased as cost savings, higher net selling prices and lower general expenses were partially offset by inflation in key cost inputs. Operating profit in KCI decreased as higher net selling prices and improvements in product mix were more than offset by inflation in key cost inputs, unfavorable currency effects, primarily in Venezuela, and increased marketing, research and general expenses. Operating profit for KCP & Other products increased 0.9 percent as higher net selling prices and cost savings were mostly offset by inflation in key cost inputs and unfavorable currency effects.Operating profit for the health care segment decreased 28.7 percent. The benefit of higher sales volumes and cost savings were more than offset by higher selling and general expenses, including ongoing I Flow litigation related expenses, inflation in key cost inputs and lower net selling prices.Organization Optimization InitiativeIn June 2009, we announced actions to reduce our worldwide salaried workforce by approximately 1,600 positions. These actions resulted in cumulative pretax charges of approximately $128 million in 2009. Related savings from this initiative were approximately $80 million in 2010 and $55 million in 2009. See Item 8, Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for detail on costs incurred for the initiative.Other (income) and expense, netOther (income) and expense, net for 2010 includes a $79 million charge related to the adoption of highly inflationary accounting in Venezuela. In addition, Other (income) and expense, net includes currency transaction losses of $20 million in 2010 and $110 million in 2009. Included in 2009 were approximately $73 million of currency transaction losses related to operations in Venezuela.Additional Income Statement Commentary 2011 versus 2010 Interest expense increased in 2011 over 2010 due to a higher average level of debt. See Item 8, Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for detail on debt activity.Our effective income tax rate was 30.2 percent for 2011 compared with 30.9 percent for 2010. The decrease was primarily due to the timing of tax initiatives.Our share of net income of equity companies decreased by $20 million primarily due to lower earnings at KimberlyClark de Mexico, S.A.B. de C.V. ("KCM"). KCMs net sales grew 4 percent due to a 2 percent benefit from the peso strengthening against the U.S. dollar, increased sales volumes of 1 percent, and a 1 percent impact from the combination of higher net selling prices and improvements in product mix. However, benefits from the increase in net sales were more than offset by inflation in key cost inputs, the negative effect of lower production volumes and increases in marketing expense.The average number of common shares outstanding declined in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to share repurchases.19Table of ContentsPART II(Continued)2010 versus 2009 Interest expense decreased in 2010 as compared to 2009 due to a lower average level of debt and lower average interest rates. Our effective income tax rate was 30.9 percent for 2010 compared with 29.0 percent for 2009. The increase was primarily due to nondeductible currency losses resulting from the adoption of highly inflationary accounting in Venezuela and changes in U.S. tax legislation, including a charge related to the Medicare Part D subsidy.Our share of net income of equity companies increased by $17 million primarily due to higher earnings at KCM, whose U.S. dollar earnings benefited from the Mexican peso strengthening against the U.S. dollar by about 7 percent on average for the year, increases in sales volumes and net selling prices of 3 percent each, and cost savings. These benefits were partially offset by inflation in key cost inputs, primarily pulp.The average number of common shares outstanding declined in 2010 as compared to 2009 due to share repurchases throughout 2010 under our share repurchase program.Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Provided by Operations Commentary: Cash provided by operations was $2.3 billion in 2011 compared to $2.7 billion in 2010. The decrease was driven primarily by higher defined benefit pension plan contributions in 2011 ($679 million in 2011 compared to $245 million in 2010). Obligations Commentary: The following table presents our total contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed or determinable. Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017+ (Millions of dollars)Long term debt$6,045 $619 $592 $524 $344 $51 $3,915Interest payments on long term debt3,406 311 280 249 236 221 2,109Returns on redeemable preferred securities81 27 27 27 Operating leases682 167 136 114 83 54 128Unconditional purchase obligations1,001 709 154 44 17 18 59Open purchase orders2,122 2,117 4 1 Total contractual obligations$13,337 $3,950 $1,193 $959 $680 $344 $6,211 Projected interest payments for variable rate debt were calculated based on the outstanding principal amounts and prevailing market rates as of December 31, 2011.Returns on redeemable preferred securities reflect required return payments through the next potential redemption date.The unconditional purchase obligations are for the purchase of raw materials, primarily pulp, and utilities. Although we are primarily liable for payments on the above operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations, based on historic operating performance and forecasted future cash flows, we believe exposure to losses, if any, under these arrangements is not material.The open purchase orders displayed in the table represent amounts for goods and services we have negotiated for delivery.20Table of ContentsPART II(Continued)The table does not include amounts where payments are discretionary or the timing is uncertain. The following payments are not included in the table: We will fund our defined benefit pension plans to meet or exceed statutory requirements and currently expect to contribute approximately $50 million to $100 million to these plans in 2012. Other postretirement benefit payments are estimated using actuarial assumptions, including expected future service, to project the future obligations. Based upon those projections, we anticipate making annual payments for these obligations of $60 million in 2012 to more than $64 million by 2021.Accrued income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions, deferred taxes and noncontrolling interests. In the event the holder of the redeemable preferred securities elects to redeem them at the next redemption election date, we would be required to repay approximately $500 million in December 2014. Investing Commentary: During 2011, our capital spending was $968 million. We expect capital spending to be $1.0 to $1.1 billion in 2012.On July 7, 2011, we collected $220 million in cash related to a note receivable on its maturity date. See Item 8, Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Financing Commentary: At December 31, 2011 and 2010, total debt and redeemable securities was $6.7 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively.We repurchase shares of Kimberly Clark common stock from time to time pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs. During 2011, we repurchased $1.24 billion of our common stock through a broker in the open market. In 2012, we plan to repurchase $900 million to $1.1 billion of shares through open market purchases, subject to market conditions.In February 2011, we issued $250 million of 3.875% notes due March 1, 2021 and $450 million of 5.3% notes due March 1, 2041. Proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchasing shares of Kimberly Clark common stock pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs.On February 9, 2012, we issued $300 million of 2.4% notes due March 1, 2022. Proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes, including to repay a portion of our $400 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% notes that were due February 15, 2012.In December 2011, we paid approximately $500 million to redeem a portion of the preferred securities of a consolidated financing subsidiary. See Item 8, Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.In October 2011, we renegotiated our $1.33 billion unused revolving credit facility, resulting in (1) a five year facility of $1.5 billion scheduled to expire in October 2016, (2) an additional $500 million facility scheduled to expire in October 2012, and (3) an option to increase either (but not both) the $1.5 billion facility or the $500 million facility by an additional $500 million. This facility supports our commercial paper program and would provide liquidity in the event our access to the commercial paper markets is unavailable for any reason. We did not borrow any amounts under the revolving credit facility in 2011.Our short term debt as of December 31, 2011 was $87 million (included in Debt payable within one year on the Consolidated Balance Sheet) and consisted of short term debt issued by non U.S. subsidiaries. The average month end balance of short term debt for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $91 million, and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 was $214 million. These short term borrowings, which included this short term debt as well as commercial paper that we issued from time to time, provide supplemental funding for supporting our operations. The level of short term debt generally fluctuates depending upon the amount of operating cash flows and the timing of customer receipts and payments for items such as dividends and income taxes.During the second quarter of 2010, the Venezuelan government enacted reforms to its currency exchange regulations that limited U.S. dollar availability to pay for the historical levels of U.S. dollar denominated imports to support operations of our Venezuelan subsidiary ("K C Venezuela"). At December 31, 2011, our net investment in KC Venezuela was approximately $250 million, valued at 5.4 bolivars per U.S. dollar. See Item 8, Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.21Table of ContentsPART II(Continued)Management believes that our ability to generate cash from operations and our capacity to issue short term and long term debt are adequate to fund working capital, capital spending, payment of dividends, pension plan contributions and other needs for the foreseeable future. Further, we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the United States to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations for the foreseeable future. Variable Interest Entities We have interests in the financing entities discussed in Item 8, Notes 6 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. The critical accounting policies we used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are important both to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used. The critical judgments by management relate to accruals for sales incentives and trade promotion allowances, pension and other postretirement benefits, future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill and long lived assets, the qualitative analyses used to determine the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities, and deferred income taxes and potential income tax assessments. These critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Sales Incentives and Trade Promotion Allowances Among those factors affecting the accruals for promotions are estimates of the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed and the type and number of activities within promotional programs between us and our trade customers. Rebate accruals are based on estimates of the quantity of products distributors have sold to specific customers. Generally, the estimates for consumer coupon costs are based on historical patterns of coupon redemption, influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories. Estimates of trade promotion liabilities for promotional program costs incurred, but unpaid, are generally based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales, timing of promotional activities and forecasted costs for activities within the promotional programs. Trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees, cooperative marketing programs, temporary price reductions, favorable end of aisle or in store product displays and other activities conducted by our customers to promote our products. Promotion accruals as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 were $339 million and $352 million, respectively. Rebate accruals as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 were $300 million and $353 million, respectively. Employee Postretirement Benefits Pension Plans We have defined benefit pension plans in North America and the United Kingdom (the Principal Plans) and or defined contribution retirement plans covering substantially all regular employees. Certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or, in certain countries, termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees. The funding policy for the qualified defined benefit plans in North America and the defined benefit plans in the United Kingdom is to contribute assets at least equal to regulatory minimum requirements. Funding for the remaining defined benefit plans outside the U.S. is based on legal requirements, tax considerations, investment opportunities, and customary business practices in these countries. Nonqualified U.S. plans providing pension benefits in excess of limitations imposed by the U.S. income tax code are not funded. Consolidated pension expense for defined benefit pension plans was $119 million in 2011 compared with $133 million for 2010. Pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions applied to each of the defined benefit plans. The weighted average expected long term rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense was 7.14 percent in 2011 compared with 7.96 percent in 2010 and will be 6.49 percent in 2012. The weighted average expected long term rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense for the Principal Plans was 7.35 percent in 2011 compared with 8.19 percent in 2010 and will be 6.68 percent in 2012. The expected long term rates of return are evaluated on an annual basis. In setting these assumptions, we consider a number of factors including projected future returns by asset class and historical long term market performance relative to the current asset allocation. Actual asset allocations are regularly reviewed and they are periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocations when considered appropriate. 22Table of ContentsPART II(Continued)Pension expense is determined using the fair value of assets rather than a calculated value that averages gains and losses (Calculated Value) over a period of years. Investment gains or losses represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the fair value of assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets. The variance between actual and expected gains and losses on pension assets is recognized in pension expense more rapidly than it would be if a Calculated Value was used for plan assets. As of December 31, 2011, the Principal Plans had cumulative unrecognized investment and actuarial losses of approximately $2.4 billion. These unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by (i) actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns, (ii) other factors, including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations, or (iii) other actuarial gains, including whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the corridor as required. The discount (or settlement) rate used to determine the present value of our future U.S. pension obligation at December 31, 2011 was based on a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with cash flows that largely match the expected benefit payments of the plan. For the U.K. and Canadian plans, the discount rate was determined based on yield curves constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities. Each years expected future benefit payments were discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate to determine the pension obligations. The weighted average discount rate for the Principal Plans decreased to 4.9 percent at December 31, 2011 from 5.58 percent at December 31, 2010.Consolidated pension expense for defined benefit pension plans is estimated to approximate $105 to $115 million in 2012 compared to $119 million incurred in 2011. The 2012 estimate is based on an expected weighted average long term rate of return on assets in the Principal Plans of 6.68 percent, a weighted average discount rate for the Principal Plans of 4.9 percent and various other assumptions. Pension expense beyond 2012 will depend on future investment performance, our contributions to the pension trusts, changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans. If the expected long term rates of return on assets for the Principal Plans were lowered by 0.25 percent, our annual pension expense would increase by approximately $12 million in 2012. If the discount rate assumptions for these same plans were reduced by 0.25 percent, annual pension expense would increase by approximately $5 million and the December 31, 2011 pension liability would increase by about $170 million. The fair value of the assets in our defined benefit plans was $5.2 billion and $4.6 billion at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. The projected benefit obligations of the defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by approximately $0.7 billion and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. On a consolidated basis, we contributed $679 million to our pension plans in 2011 compared with $245 million in 2010. In addition, we made direct benefit payments of $14 million in 2011 compared to $24 million in 2010. We currently anticipate contributing $50 million to $100 million to our pension plans in 2012. The methodology for determining the discount rate used for each countrys pension obligation is the same as the methodology used to determine the discount rate used for that countrys other postretirement benefit obligation. The discount rates displayed for the two types of obligations for our consolidated operations may appear different due to the weighting used in the calculation of the two weighted average discount rates. Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Substantially all U.S. retirees and employees are covered by unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plans. Certain benefits are based on years of service and or age at retirement. The plans are principally noncontributory for employees who were eligible to retire before 1993, contributory for most employees who retire after 1992, and we provide no subsidized benefits to most employees hired after 2003. We made benefit payments of $74 million in 2011 compared with $64 million in 2010. The determination of the discount rates used to calculate the benefit obligations of the plans is discussed in the pension benefit section above. If the discount rate assumptions for these plans were reduced by 0.25 percent, 2012 other postretirement benefit expense would increase by less than $1 million and the December 31, 2011 benefit liability would increase by about $17 million. The health care cost trend rate is based on a combination of inputs including our recent claims history and insights from external advisers regarding recent developments in the health care marketplace, as well as projections of future trends in the marketplace. The annual increase in the consolidated weighted average health care cost trend rate is expected to be 7.1 percent in 2012 and to gradually decline to 5.1 percent in 2018 and thereafter. See Item 8, Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosure of the effect of a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate.23Table of ContentsPART II(Continued)Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The carrying amount of goodwill is tested annually as of the beginning of the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Impairment testing is conducted at the operating segment level of our businesses and is based on a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of each reporting unit level. The determination of fair value requires significant management judgment including estimating future sales volumes, selling prices and costs, changes in working capital, investments in property and equipment and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Sensitivities of these fair value estimates to changes in assumptions for sales volumes, selling prices and costs are also tested. If the carrying amount of an operating segment that contains goodwill exceeds fair value, a possible impairment would be indicated. If a possible impairment is indicated, the implied fair value of goodwill would be estimated by comparing the fair value of the net assets of the unit excluding goodwill to the total fair value of the unit. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment charge would be recorded. Judgment is used in assessing whether goodwill should be tested more frequently for impairment than annually. Factors such as unexpected adverse economic conditions, competition, product changes and other external events may require more frequent assessments. The annual goodwill impairment testing has been completed and, as the fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of the respective reporting units carrying value, it has been determined that our $3.3 billion of goodwill is not impaired. We have no significant intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. At December 31, 2011, we have intangible assets with finite useful lives with a gross carrying amount of approximately $505 million and a net carrying amount of about $254 million. These intangibles are being amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss would be indicated. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the intangible asset over its fair value (based on discounted future cash flows). Judgment is used in assessing whether the carrying amount of intangible assets is not expected to be recoverable over their estimated remaining useful lives. The factors considered are similar to those outlined in the goodwill impairment discussion above. Primary Beneficiary Determination of Variable Interest Entities (VIE) The primary beneficiary of a VIE is required to consolidate the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is an enterprise that has an interest in a VIE that provides the enterprise with the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE, and the obligation to absorb significant losses or the right to receive significant benefits of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is required to be determined using a qualitative analysis considering such factors as the VIEs purpose and design, the involvement of each interest holder in the VIE, and the risks and benefits the VIE was designed to create and pass to interest holders. An enterprise is required to perform ongoing reassessments to determine if it must consolidate a VIE. We exercise judgment in performing the ongoing qualitative primary beneficiary assessments for our interests in the VIEs described in Item 8, Notes 6 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Deferred Income Taxes and Potential Assessments As of December 31, 2011, we have recorded deferred tax assets related to income tax loss carryforwards, income tax credit carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards totaling $794 million and had established valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets of $191 million, thereby resulting in a net deferred tax asset of $603 million. As of December 31, 2010, the net deferred tax asset was $734 million. These carryforwards are primarily in non U.S. taxing jurisdictions and in certain states in the U.S. Foreign tax credits earned in the U.S. in current and prior years, which cannot be used currently, also give rise to net deferred tax assets. In determining the valuation allowances to establish against these deferred tax assets, many factors are considered, including the specific taxing jurisdiction, the carryforward period, income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. As of December 31, 2011, U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately $8.4 billion of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries operating outside the U.S. These earnings are considered by management to be invested indefinitely. However, they would be subject to income tax if they were remitted as dividends, were lent to one of our U.S. entities, or if we were to sell our stock in the subsidiaries. It is not practicable to determine the amount of unrecognized 24Table of ContentsPART II(Continued)deferred U.S. income tax liability on these unremitted earnings. We periodically determine whether our non U.S. subsidiaries will invest their undistributed earnings indefinitely and reassess this determination, as appropriate. We record our global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which we operate. Where we believe that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes, the item is included in our income tax returns. Where treatment of a position is uncertain, a liability is recorded based upon the expected most likely outcome taking into consideration the technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter. These liabilities may be affected by changing interpretations of laws, rulings by tax authorities, or the expiration of the statute of limitations. Our U.S. federal income tax returns have been audited through 2007. IRS assessments of additional taxes have been paid through 2003. We have various federal income tax return positions in administrative appeals or litigation for 1999 to 2007. We currently believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.Legal Matters We are subject to various legal proceedings, claims and governmental inspections, audits or investigations pertaining to issues such as contract disputes, product liability, patents and trademarks, advertising, governmental regulations, employment and other matters. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters, to the extent not previously provided for, will not have a material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. We are subject to federal, state and local environmental protection laws and regulations with respect to our business operations and are operating in compliance with, or taking action aimed at ensuring compliance with, these laws and regulations. We have been named a potentially responsible party under the provisions of the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or analogous state statutes, at a number of waste disposal sites. None of our compliance obligations with environmental protection laws and regulations, individually or in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. New Accounting Standards See Item 8, Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of new accounting standards and their anticipated effects on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Business Outlook Pulp and Tissue RestructuringOn January 21, 2011, we adopted a pulp and tissue restructuring plan in order to exit our remaining integrated pulp manufacturing operations and improve the underlying profitability and return on invested capital of our consumer tissue and KCP businesses. In addition, on January 24, 2012, we announced our decision to streamline our manufacturing facility in Chester, Pennsylvania to further enhance the profitability of our consumer tissue business. Estimated charges related to this additional restructuring action are expected to range from $30 million to $50 million before taxes. Both restructuring actions are expected to be substantially completed by December 31, 2012. The restructuring actions are expected to result in cumulative charges in 2011 and 2012 of approximately $550 to $600 million before tax ($385 to $420 million after tax). Cash costs are expected to account for approximately 30 to 40 percent of the total charges. As a result of these restructuring actions, versus the 2010 baseline, we expect that by 2013 annual net sales will be reduced by $250 to $300 million, and operating profit is expected to increase by at least $75 million in 2013 and at least $100 million in 2014. 2012 Operating ResultsWe expect economic conditions to remain challenging in the near term, particularly in developed markets. We plan to continue focusing on innovation and targeted growth initiatives, supporting both with strategic marketing spending. We expect that commodity cost inflation will moderate in 2012, but results will likely be negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange rates weakening against the U.S. dollar. We plan to increase our investments in research and development and selling to support further growth and improve capabilities. We will continue to manage our company with financial discipline, and expect to deliver 25Table of ContentsPART II(Continued)cost savings to offset increases in cost. We plan to return cash to stockholders through our continued program of share repurchases, and have increased the amount of our regular quarterly dividend by 6 percent for 2012. Forward Looking Statements Certain matters discussed in this Form 10 K or related documents, a portion of which are incorporated herein by reference, concerning, among other things, business outlook, including anticipated costs, scope, timing and effects of the pulp and tissue restructuring actions, cost savings, marketing, research and innovation spending, cash flow and uses of cash, capital spending, anticipated financial and operating results, share repurchases and dividends, raw material and energy costs and volatility, anticipated currency rates and exchange risk, the costs and effects of legal and regulatory compliance, market demand and economic conditions, changes in finished product selling prices, anticipated effect of acquisitions, contingencies and anticipated transactions, constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are based upon our expectations and beliefs concerning future events affecting us. There can be no assurance that these events will occur or that our results will be as estimated. Forward looking statements speak only as of the date they were made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update them.The assumptions used as a basis for the forward looking statements include many estimates that, among other things, depend on the achievement of future cost savings and projected volume increases. In addition, many factors outside our control, including the prices and availability of our raw materials, potential competitive pressures on selling prices or advertising and promotion expenses for our products, energy costs, retail trade customer actions, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as general economic and political conditions globally and in the markets in which we do business, could affect the realization of such estimates.The factors described under Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Form 10 K, or in our other SEC filings, among others, could cause our future results to differ from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf. Other factors not presently known to us or that we presently consider immaterial could also affect our business operations and financial results.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a multinational enterprise, we are exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. A variety of practices are employed to manage these risks, including operating and financing activities and, where deemed appropriate, the use of derivative instruments. Derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation. All foreign currency derivative instruments are entered into with major financial institutions. Our credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date. Credit risk with respect to the counterparties is actively monitored but is not considered significant since these transactions are executed with a diversified group of financial institutions. Presented below is a description of our risks (foreign currency risk and interest rate risk) together with a sensitivity analysis, performed annually, of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices. These analyses reflect managements view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a one year period. Also included is a description of our commodity price risk. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is managed by the systematic use of foreign currency forward and swap contracts for a portion of our exposure. The use of these instruments allows the management of transactional exposures to exchange rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset, in whole or in part, losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure. Foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. An annual test is performed to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on annual operating profit based on our foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures at the current year end. The balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliates net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the U.S. dollar. The results of these sensitivity tests are presented in the following paragraphs. 26Table of ContentsPART II(Continued)As of December 31, 2011, a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in a net pretax loss of approximately $50 million. These hypothetical losses on transactional exposures are based on the difference between the December 31, 2011 rates and the assumed rates. In the view of management, the above hypothetical losses resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Our operations in Venezuela are reported using highly inflationary accounting and their functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Changes in the value of a Venezuelan bolivar versus the U.S. dollar applied to our bolivar denominated net monetary asset position are recorded in income at the time of the change. At December 31, 2011, a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate would have resulted in a net pretax loss of approximately $13 million. There are no viable options for hedging this exposure. The translation of the balance sheets of non U.S. operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Consequently, an annual test is performed to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of non U.S. operations into U.S. dollars. These translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments (UTA) within stockholders equity. The hypothetical change in UTA is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these non U.S. operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates. The results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph.As of December 31, 2011, a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the prevailing market rates of our foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced stockholders equity by approximately $850 million. These hypothetical adjustments in UTA are based on the difference between the December 31, 2011 exchange rates and the assumed rates. In the view of management, the above UTA adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position because they would not affect our cash flow. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable and fixed rate debt composed of short and long term instruments. The objective is to maintain a cost effective mix that management deems appropriate. At December 31, 2011, the debt portfolio was composed of approximately 19 percent variable rate debt and 81 percent fixed rate debt. Two separate tests are performed to determine whether changes in interest rates would have a significant effect on our financial position or future results of operations. Both tests are based on consolidated debt levels at the time of the test. The first test estimates the effect of interest rate changes on fixed rate debt. Interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of fixed rate debt due to differences between the current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments. With respect to fixed rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2011, a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixed rate debt by about $194 million. The second test estimates the potential effect on future pretax income that would result from increased interest rates applied to our current level of variable rate debt. With respect to variable rate debt, a 10 percent increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the future results of operations or cash flows. Commodity Price Risk We are subject to commodity price risk, the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp. Selling prices of tissue products are influenced, in part, by the market price for pulp, which is determined by industry supply and demand. As previously discussed under Item 1A, Risk Factors, increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. Derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks. Our energy, manufacturing and transportation costs are affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy, energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions. As previously discussed under Item 1A, Risk Factors, there can be no assurance we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources. In addition, we are subject to price risk for utilities, primarily natural gas, which are used in our manufacturing operations. Derivative instruments are used to hedge a portion of natural gas price risk in accordance with our risk management policy.27Table of ContentsPART II(Continued)
