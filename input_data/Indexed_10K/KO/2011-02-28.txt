Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference. Most of our branded beverage products, particularly outside of North America, are manufactured, sold and distributed by independently owned and managed bottling partners. However, from time to time we acquire or take control of bottling or canning operations, often in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance. Owning such a controlling interest enables us to compensate for limited local resources; help focus the bottlers sales and marketing programs; assist in the development of the bottlers business and information systems; and establish an appropriate capital structure for the bottler. The Company owned or controlled bottling operations, other than those managed by CCR, are included in our Bottling Investments group. In line with our long term bottling strategy, we may periodically consider options for reducing our ownership interest in a Bottling Investments group bottler. One such option is to combine our bottling interests with the bottling interests of others to form strategic business alliances. Another option is to sell our interest in a bottling operation to one of our other bottling partners in which we have an equity method investment. In both of these situations, our Company continues to participate in the bottlers results of operations through our share of the strategic business alliances or equity method investees earnings or losses. 4 The following table sets forth our most significant brands in each of our major beverage categories: SPARKLING BEVERAGES* STILL BEVERAGES* Juices and Juice Drinks Coffees and Teas Waters Coca Cola Minute Maid1 Nestea teas2 Ciel1 Sprite Minute Maid Pulpy Georgia coffees3 Dasani1 Diet Coke / Coca Cola Light Hi C Sokenbicha teas3 Bonaqua / Bonaqa1 Fanta5 Simply4 Le&atilde;o / Matte Le&atilde;o teas7 Ice Dew8 Coca Cola Zero / Coke Zero Dobriy6 Dogadan teas10 Kinley11 Schweppes12 del Valle9 glac&eacute;au smartwater4 Thums Up13 Cappy1 Fresca Barqs14 Energy Drinks Other Still Beverages Sports Drinks Lift burn glac&eacute;au vitaminwater Powerade1 Pop18 Relentless15 FUZE16 Aquarius17 Inca Kola19 NOS4 Kuat20 Full Throttle4 * Includes, for each brand, all flavor variations and line extensions. Unless otherwise indicated in a footnote below, products under the brands are sold in markets across two or more geographic operating groups. 1 In some markets, certain products sold under this brand are sparkling beverages. 2 Nestea products are distributed in the United States under a sublicense from a subsidiary of Nestl&eacute; S.A., and in various other markets worldwide through Beverage Partners Worldwide ("BPW"), the Companys joint venture with Nestl&eacute; S.A.

Consumer demand can vary from one locale to another and can change over time within a single locale. Employing our business strategy, and with special focus on core brands, our Company seeks to build its existing brands and, at the same time, to broaden its historical family of brands, products and services in order to create and satisfy consumer demand locale by locale. During 2010, our Company introduced a variety of new brands, brand extensions and new beverage products. Among numerous examples, in the Eurasia and Africa group, new launches included new flavors of Minute Maid juice and juice drinks in India, including Minute Maid Nimbu Fresh; Maaza Milky Delite in India, a blend of mango and milk and the Companys first venture into dairy products in India; the reformulated Fanta in Russia with natural flavors and colors, and no preservatives; and Dogadan ready to drink tea in Turkey. In the Latin America group we launched del Valle Pulpy, a juice drink with real orange pulp, in Mexico; and Blak, an on premise liquid coffee concentrate sold to customers through a dispenser, also in Mexico. In the North America group, we introduced to consumers in the United States glac&eacute;au vitaminwater zero, an extension of our popular glac&eacute;au vitaminwater products with zero calories per serving; and Sokenbicha, a line of brewed unsweetened teas blended with natural botanicals, which are popular in Japan. In the Europe group, new launches included Coca Cola Zero Caffeine Free in France, the first caffeine free variant of the Coca Cola Zero brand sold in Europe; and Bonaqua Lemon Lime in the Czech Republic. In the Pacific group, in China we launched Minute Maid 10 Score V, a juice drink fortified with vitamins, and, through BPW, launched Yuan Ye, a new jasmine flavor variant of its ready to drink tea beverage; and we extended the footprint of Minute Maid Pulpy, a juice drink with real bits of fruit pulp, with launches in Singapore and Malaysia. In furtherance of our commitments to sustainability and innovation, during 2010 we expanded our launch of our innovative PlantBottle packaging, a polyethylene terephthalate ("PET") bottle made partially from plant based material that, like our existing PET bottles, is 100 percent recyclable. PlantBottle packaging was introduced in Japan, Mexico, Brazil, Norway, Sweden, Chile and China (at the Shanghai Expo). Also in 2010, we expanded the footprint of our innovative Coca Cola Freestyle fountain dispenser to more than 400 customer locations across 20 markets in the United States. Coca Cola Freestyle provides consumers with a greater choice of brands, with more than 100 different regular and low calorie branded beverages, including a variety of still beverages. We measure the volume of Company beverage products sold in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and (2) concentrate sales. As used in this report, "unit case" means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight ounce servings); and "unit case volume" means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners (the "Coca Cola system") to customers. Unit case volume primarily consists of beverage products bearing Company trademarks. Also included in unit case volume are certain products licensed to, or distributed by, our Company, and brands owned by Coca Cola system bottlers for which our Company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive economic benefit. In addition, unit case volume includes sales by joint ventures in which the Company has an equity interest. We believe unit case volume is one of the measures of the underlying strength of the Coca Cola system because it measures trends at the consumer level. The unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the Company from its bottling partners and distributors. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates and syrups (in all cases expressed in equivalent unit cases) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. Unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period. Factors such as seasonality, bottlers inventory practices, supply point changes, timing of price increases, new product introductions and changes in product mix can impact unit case volume and concentrate sales volume and can create differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. In addition to the items mentioned above, the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures, in which the Company has an equity interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates or syrups, may give rise to differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. Distribution System and Bottlers Agreements We make our branded beverage products available to consumers in more than 200 countries through our network of Company owned or controlled bottling and distribution operations, bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers the worlds largest beverage distribution system. Consumers enjoy finished beverage products bearing our trademarks at a rate of approximately 1.7 billion servings each day. We continue to expand our marketing presence and increase our unit case volume in developed, developing and emerging markets. Our strong and stable system helps us to 6 capture growth by manufacturing, distributing and marketing existing, enhanced and new innovative products to our consumers throughout the world. The Coca Cola system sold approximately 25.5 billion, 24.4 billion and 23.7 billion unit cases of our products in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Sparkling beverages represented approximately 76 percent, 77 percent and 78 percent of our worldwide unit case volume for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Trademark Coca Cola Beverages accounted for approximately 50 percent, 51 percent and 51 percent of our worldwide unit case volume for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In 2010, unit case volume in the United States ("U.S. unit case volume") represented approximately 20 percent of the Companys worldwide unit case volume. Of the U.S. unit case volume for 2010, approximately 71 percent was attributable to sparkling beverages and approximately 29 percent to still beverages. Trademark Coca Cola Beverages accounted for approximately 51 percent of U.S. unit case volume for 2010. Unit case volume outside the United States represented approximately 80 percent of the Companys worldwide unit case volume for 2010. The countries outside the United States in which our unit case volumes were the largest in 2010 were Mexico, China, Brazil and Japan, which together accounted for approximately 31 percent of our worldwide unit case volume. Of the non U.S. unit case volume for 2010, approximately 78 percent was attributable to sparkling beverages and 22 percent to still beverages. Trademark Coca Cola Beverages accounted for approximately 50 percent of non U.S. unit case volume for 2010. In our concentrate operations, we typically sell concentrates and syrups to our bottling partners, who use the concentrate to manufacture finished products which they sell to distributors and other customers. Separate contracts ("Bottlers Agreements") exist between our Company and each of our bottling partners regarding the manufacture and sale of Company products. Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the Bottlers Agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare specified Company Trademark Beverages, to package the same in authorized containers, and to distribute and sell the same in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized containers; however, we typically reserve for ourselves or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory, and (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such beverages in the territory in any other manner or form. Territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law. Being a bottler does not create a legal partnership or joint venture between us and our bottlers. Our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents. While, as described below, under most of our Bottlers Agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Companys ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of its syrups, concentrates and finished beverages is subject, both outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. Bottlers Agreements Outside the United States The Bottlers Agreements between us and our authorized bottlers outside the United States generally are of stated duration, subject in some cases to possible extensions or renewals of the term of the contract. Generally, these contracts are subject to termination by the Company following the occurrence of certain designated events. These events include defined events of default and certain changes in ownership or control of the bottler. In certain parts of the world outside the United States, we have not granted comprehensive beverage production rights to the bottlers. In such instances, we or our authorized suppliers sell Company Trademark Beverages to the bottlers for sale and distribution throughout the designated territory, often on a nonexclusive basis. Most of the Bottlers Agreements in force between us and bottlers outside the United States authorize the bottlers to manufacture and distribute fountain syrups, usually on a nonexclusive basis. 7 Our Company generally has complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to bottlers outside the United States. In some instances, however, we have agreed or may in the future agree with a bottler with respect to concentrate pricing on a prospective basis for specified time periods. In some markets, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned incentives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers always changing needs and tastes, we worked with our bottling partners to develop and implement an incidence based pricing model for sparkling and still beverages. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products are sold and package mix. Outside the United States, in most cases, we have no obligation to provide marketing support to the bottlers. Nevertheless, we may, at our discretion, contribute toward bottler expenditures for advertising and marketing. We may also elect to undertake independent or cooperative advertising and marketing activities. Bottlers Agreements Within the United States Based on unit case volume for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2010 (the first quarter of operation following our acquisition of CCEs North American business), CCR, our bottling and customer service organization for North America, manufactures, sells and distributes approximately 88 percent of our unit case volume in the United States. The discussion below regarding the terms of Bottlers Agreements and other contracts relates to Bottlers Agreements and contracts for territories in the United States that are not covered by CCR. In the United States, with certain very limited exceptions, the Bottlers Agreements for Trademark Coca Cola Beverages and other cola flavored beverages have no stated expiration date. Our standard contracts for other sparkling beverage flavors and for still beverages are of stated duration, subject to bottler renewal rights. The Bottlers Agreements in the United States are subject to termination by the Company for nonperformance or upon the occurrence of certain defined events of default that may vary from contract to contract. Under the terms of the Bottlers Agreements, bottlers in the United States are authorized to manufacture and distribute Company Trademark Beverages in bottles and cans. However, these bottlers generally are not authorized to manufacture fountain syrups. Rather, in the United States, our Company manufactures and sells fountain syrups to authorized fountain wholesalers (including certain authorized bottlers) and some fountain retailers. These wholesalers in turn sell the syrups or deliver them on our behalf to restaurants and other retailers. Certain of the Bottlers Agreements for cola flavored sparkling beverages in effect in the United States give us complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups for Company Trademark Beverages. In some instances, we have agreed or may in the future agree with a bottler with respect to concentrate pricing on a prospective basis for specified time periods. Certain Bottlers Agreements, entered into prior to 1987, provide for concentrates or syrups for certain Trademark Coca Cola Beverages and other cola flavored Company Trademark Beverages to be priced pursuant to a stated formula. In 2010, bottlers accounting for approximately 3.6 percent of total unit case volume in the United States have contracts for certain Trademark Coca Cola Beverages and other cola flavored Company Trademark Beverages with pricing formulas that generally provide for a baseline price. This baseline price may be adjusted periodically by the Company, up to a maximum indexed ceiling price, and is adjusted quarterly based upon changes in certain sugar or sweetener prices, as applicable. In 2010, bottlers accounting for approximately 0.1 percent of total unit case volume in the United States operate under our oldest form of contract, which provides for a fixed price for Coca Cola syrup used in bottles and cans. This price is subject to quarterly adjustments to reflect changes in the quoted price of sugar. We have standard contracts with bottlers in the United States for the sale of concentrates and syrups for non cola flavored sparkling beverages and certain still beverages in bottles and cans, and, in certain cases, for the sale of finished still beverages in bottles and cans. All of these standard contracts give the Company complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale. In an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned incentives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers always changing needs and tastes, we worked with bottling partners that produce and distribute most of our non CCR unit case volume in the United States to develop and implement an incidence based pricing model, primarily for sparkling beverages. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished 8 products are sold and package mix. We expect to use an incidence based pricing model in 2011 with bottlers that produce and distribute most of our non CCR unit case volume in the United States. Under most of our Bottlers Agreements and other standard beverage contracts with bottlers in the United States, our Company has no obligation to participate with bottlers in expenditures for advertising and marketing. Nevertheless, at our discretion, we may contribute toward such expenditures and undertake independent or cooperative advertising and marketing activities. Some U.S. Bottlers Agreements entered into prior to 1987 impose certain marketing obligations on us with respect to certain Company Trademark Beverages. Promotions and Marketing Programs In addition to conducting our own independent advertising and marketing activities, we may provide promotional and marketing services or funds to our bottlers. In most cases, we do this on a discretionary basis under the terms of commitment letters or agreements, even though we are not obligated to do so under the terms of the bottling or distribution agreements between our Company and the bottlers. Also, on a discretionary basis in most cases, our Company may develop and introduce new products, packages and equipment to assist its bottlers. Likewise, in many instances, we provide promotional and marketing services and or funds and or dispensing equipment and repair services to fountain and bottle/can retailers, typically pursuant to marketing agreements. The aggregate amount of funds provided by our Company to bottlers, resellers or other customers of our Companys products, principally for participation in promotional and marketing programs, was approximately $5.0 billion in 2010. Significant Equity Method Investments We make equity investments in selected bottling operations with the intention of maximizing the strength and efficiency of the Coca Cola systems production, distribution and marketing capabilities around the world. These investments are intended to result in increases in unit case volume, net revenues and profits at the bottler level, which in turn generate increased concentrate sales for our Companys concentrate and syrup business. When this occurs, both we and our bottling partners benefit from long term growth in volume, improved cash flows and increased shareowner value. In cases where our investments in bottlers represent noncontrolling interests, our intention is to provide expertise and resources to strengthen those businesses. When our equity investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee bottlers operating and financial policies, we account for the investment under the equity method, and we sometimes refer to such a bottler as an "equity method investee bottler" or "equity method investee." Our significant equity method investee bottlers include the following: Coca Cola Hellenic Bottling Company S.A. ("Coca Cola Hellenic"). Our ownership interest in Coca Cola Hellenic was approximately 23 percent at December 31, 2010. Coca Cola Hellenic has bottling and distribution rights, through direct ownership or joint ventures, in Armenia, Austria, Belarus, Bosnia Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, Nigeria, Northern Ireland, Poland, Republic of Ireland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Ukraine. Coca Cola Hellenic estimates that the area in these 28 countries which it serves through its bottling and distribution rights has a combined population of 560 million people. In 2010, Coca Cola Hellenics net sales of beverage products were approximately $8.8 billion. In 2010, approximately 43 percent of the unit case volume of Coca Cola Hellenic consisted of Trademark Coca Cola Beverages; approximately 52 percent of its unit case volume consisted of other Company Trademark Beverages; and approximately 5 percent of its unit case volume consisted of beverage products of Coca Cola Hellenic or other companies. Coca Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. ("Coca Cola FEMSA"). Our ownership interest in Coca Cola FEMSA was approximately 32 percent at December 31, 2010. Coca Cola FEMSA is a Mexican holding company with bottling subsidiaries in a substantial part of central Mexico, including Mexico City and southeastern Mexico; greater S&atilde;o Paulo, Campinas, Santos, the state of Matto Grosso do Sul, part of the state of Minas Gerais and part of the state of Goias in Brazil; central Guatemala; most of Colombia; all of Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Panama and Venezuela; and greater Buenos Aires, Argentina. Coca Cola FEMSA estimates that the territories in which it markets beverage products contain approximately 45 percent of the population of Mexico, 23 percent of the population of Brazil, 99 percent of the population of Colombia, 36 percent of the population of Guatemala, 100 percent of the populations of Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Panama and Venezuela, and 30 percent of the population of Argentina. In 2010, Coca Cola FEMSAs net 9 sales of beverage products were approximately $8.1 billion. In 2010, approximately 62 percent of the unit case volume of Coca Cola FEMSA consisted of Trademark Coca Cola Beverages; approximately 37 percent of its unit case volume consisted of other Company Trademark Beverages; and less than 1 percent of its unit case volume consisted of beverage products of Coca Cola FEMSA or other companies. Coca Cola Amatil Limited ("Coca Cola Amatil"). Our ownership interest in Coca Cola Amatil was approximately 30 percent at December 31, 2010. Coca Cola Amatil has bottling and distribution rights, through direct ownership or joint ventures, in Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. Coca Cola Amatil estimates that the territories in which it markets beverage products contain 100 percent of the populations of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Papua New Guinea, and 98 percent of the population of Indonesia. In 2010, Coca Cola Amatils net sales of beverage products were approximately $3.7 billion. In 2010, approximately 47 percent of the unit case volume of Coca Cola Amatil consisted of Trademark Coca Cola Beverages; approximately 41 percent of its unit case volume consisted of other Company Trademark Beverages; and approximately 12 percent of its unit case volume consisted of beverage products of Coca Cola Amatil or other companies. Seasonality Sales of our ready to drink nonalcoholic beverages are somewhat seasonal, with the second and third calendar quarters accounting for the highest sales volumes. The volume of sales in the beverages business may be affected by weather conditions. Competition Our Company competes in the nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry. The nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry is highly competitive, consisting of numerous companies. These include companies that, like our Company, compete in multiple geographic areas, as well as firms that are primarily regional or local in operation. Competitive products include numerous nonalcoholic sparkling beverages; various water products, including packaged, flavored and enhanced waters; juices and nectars; fruit drinks and dilutables (including syrups and powdered drinks); coffees and teas; energy and sports and other performance enhancing drinks; dairy based drinks; functional beverages; and various other nonalcoholic beverages. These competitive beverages are sold to consumers in both ready to drink and other than ready to drink form. In many of the countries in which we do business, including the United States, PepsiCo, Inc., is one of our primary competitors. Other significant competitors include, but are not limited to, Nestl&eacute;, Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc., Groupe Danone, Kraft Foods Inc. and Unilever. In certain markets, our competition includes beer companies. We also compete against numerous regional and local companies and, in some markets, against retailers that have developed their own store or private label beverage brands. Competitive factors impacting our business include, but are not limited to, pricing, advertising, sales promotion programs, product innovation, increased efficiency in production techniques, the introduction of new packaging, new vending and dispensing equipment, and brand and trademark development and protection. Our competitive strengths include leading brands with a high level of consumer acceptance; a worldwide network of bottlers and distributors of Company products; sophisticated marketing capabilities; and a talented group of dedicated associates. Our competitive challenges include strong competition in all geographic regions and, in many countries, a concentrated retail sector with powerful buyers able to freely choose among Company products, products of competitive beverage suppliers and individual retailers own store or private label beverage brands. Raw Materials Water is a main ingredient in substantially all of our products. While historically we have not experienced significant water supply difficulties, water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and our Company recognizes water availability, quality and the sustainability of that natural resource for both our operations and also the communities where we operate as one of the key challenges facing our business. In addition to water, the principal raw materials used in our business are nutritive and non nutritive sweeteners. In the United States, the principal nutritive sweetener is high fructose corn syrup ("HFCS"), a form of sugar, which is available from numerous domestic sources and is historically subject to fluctuations in its market price. The principal nutritive sweetener used by our business outside the United States is sucrose, another form of sugar, which is also 10 available from numerous sources and is historically subject to fluctuations in its market price. Our Company generally has not experienced any difficulties in obtaining its requirements for nutritive sweeteners. In the United States, we purchase HFCS to meet our and our bottlers requirements with the assistance of Coca Cola Bottlers Sales & Services Company LLC ("CCBSS"). CCBSS is a limited liability company that is owned by authorized Coca Cola bottlers doing business in the United States. Among other things, CCBSS provides procurement services to our Company for the purchase of various goods and services in the United States, including HFCS. The principal non nutritive sweeteners we use in our business are aspartame, acesulfame potassium, saccharin, cyclamate and sucralose. Generally, these raw materials are readily available from numerous sources. However, our Company purchases aspartame, an important non nutritive sweetener that is used alone or in combination with other important non nutritive sweeteners such as saccharin or acesulfame potassium in our low calorie sparkling beverage products, primarily from The NutraSweet Company and Ajinomoto Co., Inc., which we consider to be our primary sources for the supply of this product. We currently purchase acesulfame potassium from Nutrinova Nutrition Specialties & Food Ingredients GmbH, which we consider to be our primary source for the supply of this product, and from two additional suppliers. Our Company generally has not experienced any difficulties in obtaining its requirements for non nutritive sweeteners. Our Company sells a number of products sweetened with sucralose, a non nutritive sweetener. We work closely with Tate & Lyle, our primary sucralose supplier, to maintain continuity of supply, and we do not anticipate difficulties in obtaining our requirements. We also purchase Truvia, a non nutritive natural sweetener made with rebiana, which is derived from the stevia plant, from Cargill under a multi year agreement, and we do not anticipate any supply issues with this ingredient. With regard to juice and juice drink products, citrus fruit, particularly orange juice concentrate, is our principal raw material. The citrus industry is subject to the variability of weather conditions. In particular, freezing weather or hurricanes in central Florida may result in shortages and higher prices for orange juice concentrate throughout the industry. Due to our ability to also source orange juice concentrate from the Southern Hemisphere (particularly from Brazil), we normally have an adequate supply of orange juice concentrate that meets our Companys standards. Our Company owned or consolidated bottling and canning operations and our finished products business also purchase various other raw materials including, but not limited to, PET resin, preforms and bottles; glass and aluminum bottles; aluminum and steel cans; plastic closures; aseptic fiber packaging; labels; cartons; cases; post mix packaging; and carbon dioxide. We generally purchase these raw materials from multiple suppliers and historically have not experienced material shortages. Patents, Copyrights, Trade Secrets and Trademarks Our Company owns numerous patents, copyrights and trade secrets, as well as substantial know how and technology, which we collectively refer to in this report as "technology." This technology generally relates to our Companys products and the processes for their production; the packages used for our products; the design and operation of various processes and equipment used in our business; and certain quality assurance software. Some of the technology is licensed to suppliers and other parties. Our sparkling beverage and other beverage formulae are among the important trade secrets of our Company. We own numerous trademarks that are very important to our business. Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are in use and or their registrations are properly maintained. Pursuant to our Bottlers Agreements, we authorize our bottlers to use applicable Company trademarks in connection with their manufacture, sale and distribution of Company products. In addition, we grant licenses to third parties from time to time to use certain of our trademarks in conjunction with certain merchandise and food products. Governmental Regulation Our Company is required to comply, and it is our policy to comply, with applicable laws in the numerous countries throughout the world in which we do business. In many jurisdictions, compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us, and our operations may come under special scrutiny by competition law authorities due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions. 11  The production, distribution and sale in the United States of many of our Companys products are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; the Federal Trade Commission Act; the Lanham Act; state consumer protection laws; federal, state and local workplace health and safety laws; various federal, state and local environmental protection laws; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. Outside the United States, the production, distribution and sale of our many products and related operations are also subject to numerous similar and other statutes and regulations. A California law, known as Proposition 65, requires that a warning appear on any product sold in California that contains a substance that, in the view of the state, causes cancer or birth defects. The state maintains lists of these substances. Proposition 65 exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products in California because it recognizes no generally applicable quantitative thresholds below which a warning is not required. Consequently, the detection of even a trace amount of a listed substance can subject an affected product to the requirement of a warning label. One or more substances that are currently on the Proposition 65 lists, or that may be added in the future, can be detected in Company products at low levels that are safe. However, Proposition 65 does not require a warning if the manufacturer of a product can demonstrate that the use of the product in question exposes consumers to a daily quantity of a listed substance: that is below a "safe harbor" that may be established; that is naturally occurring; that is the result of necessary cooking; or that is subject to another applicable exemption. One of the two listed substances that can presently be detected in a Company product has been shown to be naturally occurring. As to the other, the state has proposed, but not yet finally established, an inappropriately low safe harbor level that is still subject to public comment and to potential legal challenge. Bottlers of our beverage products presently offer and use nonrefillable, recyclable containers in the United States and various other markets around the world. Some of these bottlers also offer and use refillable containers, which are also recyclable. Legal requirements apply in various jurisdictions in the United States and overseas requiring that deposits or certain ecotaxes or fees be charged for the sale, marketing and use of certain nonrefillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other types of statutes and regulations relating to beverage container deposits, recycling, ecotaxes and or product stewardship also apply in various jurisdictions in the United States and overseas. We anticipate that additional, similar legal requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future at local, state and federal levels, both in the United States and elsewhere. All of our Companys facilities and other operations in the United States and elsewhere around the world are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations, including those relating to the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater. Our policy is to comply with all such legal requirements. Compliance with these provisions has not had, and we do not expect such compliance to have, any material adverse effect on our Companys capital expenditures, net income or competitive position. Employees We refer to our employees as "associates." As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, our Company had approximately 139,600 and 92,800 associates, respectively, of which approximately 4,900 and 17,900, respectively, were employed by consolidated variable interest entities ("VIEs"). The increase in the total number of associates in 2010 was primarily due to the impact of our acquisition of CCEs North American business, partially offset by the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE and the deconsolidation of certain entities due to the Companys adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB"). As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, our Company had approximately 70,400 and 11,700 associates, respectively, located in the United States, including Puerto Rico, of which approximately 720 and 190, respectively, were employed by consolidated VIEs. Our Company, through its divisions and subsidiaries, has entered into numerous collective bargaining agreements. As of December 31, 2010, approximately 18,600 associates in North America were covered by collective bargaining 12 agreements. These agreements usually have terms of three to five years. We currently expect that we will be able to renegotiate such agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire. The Company believes that its relations with its associates are generally satisfactory. Securities Exchange Act Reports The Company maintains a website at the following address: www.thecoca colacompany.com. The information on the Companys website is not incorporated by reference in this annual report on Form 10 K. We make available on or through our website certain reports and amendments to those reports that we file with or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). These include our annual reports on Form 10 K, our quarterly reports on Form 10 Q and our current reports on Form 8 K. We make this information available on our website free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file the information with, or furnish it to, the SEC.  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods. Obesity and other health concerns may reduce demand for some of our products. Consumers, public health officials and government officials are becoming increasingly concerned about the public health consequences associated with obesity, particularly among young people. In addition, some researchers, health advocates and dietary guidelines are encouraging consumers to reduce consumption of sugar sweetened beverages, including those sweetened with HFCS or other nutritive sweeteners. Increasing public concern about these issues; possible new taxes and governmental regulations concerning the marketing, labeling or availability of our beverages; and negative publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against us or other companies in our industry relating to the marketing, labeling or sale of sugar sweetened beverages may reduce demand for our beverages, which could affect our profitability. Water scarcity and poor quality could negatively impact the Coca Cola systems production costs and capacity. Water is the main ingredient in substantially all of our products. It is also a limited resource in many parts of the world, facing unprecedented challenges from overexploitation, increasing pollution, poor management and climate change. As demand for water continues to increase around the world, and as water becomes scarcer and the quality of available water deteriorates, our system may incur increasing production costs or face capacity constraints which could adversely affect our profitability or net operating revenues in the long run. Changes in the nonalcoholic beverages business environment could impact our financial results. The nonalcoholic beverages business environment is rapidly evolving as a result of, among other things, changes in consumer preferences, including changes based on health and nutrition considerations and obesity concerns; shifting consumer tastes and needs; changes in consumer lifestyles; and competitive product and pricing pressures. In addition, our industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in the retail channel, particularly in Europe and the United States. If we are unable to successfully adapt to this rapidly changing environment, our share of sales, volume growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected. If we fail to realize a significant portion of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of CCEs North American business, the value of your investment in our Company may be adversely affected. On October 2, 2010, we acquired CCEs North American bottling and distribution operations. We believe that the acquisition will enable us to evolve our entire business in North America, including the acquired operations, to more profitably deliver our valuable brands in the largest nonalcoholic ready to drink beverage market in the world. When we 13 determined to make the acquisition, we believed that the transaction would, among other things, enhance our ability to create a more fully integrated and adaptable supply chain in the North American market to allow our combined North American business to more efficiently and effectively operate our distribution chain in the North American territories and enhance revenue opportunities; create a unified operating system in North America which will address the unique needs of the North American market; strategically position us to better market and distribute our products in North America; improve efficiencies by streamlining operations and reducing or eliminating the costs, expenses, management time and resources associated with interactions and negotiations between the previously separate organizations; allow us to optimize and improve the efficiencies of manufacturing and logistics operations in North America through economies of scale and geography; generate significant operational synergies; facilitate and increase the pace of innovation and new product introduction in North America; and optimize our operating model and improve the strategic planning process, increasing management focus and streamlining decision making. While we believe that the anticipated benefits, including our estimated operational synergies, are achievable, it is possible that we may not be able to realize some or even a significant portion of such benefits or operational synergies, or may not be able to achieve them within the anticipated time frame. If we are unable to successfully integrate our North American businesses with the acquired CCE North American business and to realize a significant portion of the anticipated benefits or operational synergies, or if it takes us significantly longer than expected to realize such benefits or operational synergies, our future results of operations may be adversely affected and we may not be able to meet investors expectations or achieve our long term growth objectives, which could negatively affect the value of your investment in our Company. We may incur higher than expected costs in connection with the integration of the acquired CCE North American business, which could hurt our financial performance in future periods. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant costs and expenses in connection with the integration of the North American businesses we owned prior to the CCE transaction with the acquired CCE North American business. While we believe that our estimates of integration costs and expenses are reasonable, we cannot assure you that our actual costs and expenses will not be significantly higher than our current estimates or that we will not incur significant unanticipated integration costs and expenses in the future. If we underestimated or incur significant unanticipated integration costs and expenses, our future financial results could suffer. Our indebtedness following completion of the acquisition of CCEs North American business is substantially greater than our historical level of indebtedness, which will increase our borrowing costs and interest expense in future periods and, therefore, may adversely affect our financial performance. As a result of the CCE transaction, we assumed approximately $7.9 billion of debt from CCE. As a result of the substantial increase in our indebtedness, our borrowing costs and interest expense in future periods will be higher than in the past. The increased indebtedness and higher borrowing costs and interest expense may reduce amounts available for dividends, stock repurchases, capital expenditures and acquisitions, and may cause rating agencies to downgrade our debt, all of which could have adverse effects on our future financial performance. Our pension expense has substantially increased as a result of the acquisition of CCEs North American business and we may incur multi employer plan withdrawal liabilities in the future, which could negatively impact our financial performance. Our total pension expense for 2010 was $176 million. In 2011, we expect our total pension expense to be approximately $240 million, with most of the expected increase due to the impact of our acquisition of CCEs North American business. In addition, as a result of the acquisition of CCEs North American business, the Company currently participates in various multi employer pension plans in the United States. Our pension expense for U.S. multi employer plans totaled $9 million in 2010. The plans we participate in have contractual arrangements that extend into 2015. If, in the future, we choose to withdraw from these plans, we will likely need to record withdrawal liabilities, some of which may be material and could negatively impact our financial performance in the applicable periods. Continuing uncertainty in the credit and equity market conditions may adversely affect our financial performance. The global credit markets experienced unprecedented disruptions during late 2008 and early 2009. While credit market conditions have improved somewhat since the crisis, the improvements have not been uniform. The cost and availability of credit vary by market and are subject to changes in the global or regional economic environment. If the current uncertain conditions in the credit markets continue or worsen, our ability to access credit markets on favorable terms 14 may be negatively affected, which could increase our cost of borrowing. In addition, the current uncertain credit market conditions may make it more difficult for our bottling partners to access financing on terms comparable to those available prior to the global credit crisis, which would affect the Coca Cola systems profitability as well as our share of the income of bottling partners in which we have equity method investments. The current uncertain global credit market conditions and their actual or perceived effects on our and our major bottling partners results of operations and financial condition, along with the current unfavorable economic environment in the United States and much of the world, may increase the likelihood that the major independent credit agencies will downgrade our credit ratings, which could have a negative effect on our borrowing costs. The significant decline in the equity markets and in the valuation of other assets precipitated by the global credit crisis and related financial system instability affected the value of our pension plan assets. In spite of improving asset values in late 2009 and 2010, the fair value of our plan assets remains lower than pre crisis levels, and this could lead to higher pension expense in the future. In addition, some of the major financial institutions remain fragile, and the counterparty risk associated with our existing derivative financial instruments remains higher than pre crisis levels. Therefore, we may be unable to secure creditworthy counterparties for derivative transactions in the future or may incur higher than anticipated costs in our hedging activities. The decrease in availability of consumer credit resulting from the financial crisis, as well as general unfavorable economic conditions, may also cause consumers to reduce their discretionary spending, which would reduce the demand for our beverages and negatively affect our net revenues and the Coca Cola systems profitability. Increased competition could hurt our business. The nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry is highly competitive. We compete with major international beverage companies that, like our Company, operate in multiple geographic areas, as well as numerous companies that are primarily local in operation. In many countries in which we do business, including the United States, PepsiCo, Inc., is a primary competitor. Other significant competitors include, but are not limited to, Nestl&eacute;, Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc., Groupe Danone, Kraft Foods Inc. and Unilever. In certain markets, our competition includes major beer companies. Our beverage products also compete against local or regional brands as well as against store or private label brands developed by retailers, some of which are Coca Cola system customers. Our ability to gain or maintain share of sales or gross margins in the global market or in various local markets may be limited as a result of actions by competitors. If we are unable to expand our operations in developing and emerging markets, our growth rate could be negatively affected. Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in developing and emerging markets, which in turn depends on economic and political conditions in those markets and on our ability to acquire or form strategic business alliances with local bottlers and to make necessary infrastructure enhancements to production facilities, distribution networks, sales equipment and technology. Moreover, the supply of our products in developing and emerging markets must match consumers demand for those products. Due to product price, limited purchasing power and cultural differences, there can be no assurance that our products will be accepted in any particular developing or emerging market. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results. We earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the euro, the Japanese yen, the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso. In 2010, we used 74 functional currencies in addition to the U.S. dollar and derived approximately $24.5 billion of net operating revenues from operations outside the United States. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies will affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, unexpected and dramatic devaluations of currencies in developing or emerging markets, such as the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar, could negatively affect the value of our earnings from, and of the assets located in, those markets. Because of the geographic diversity of our operations, weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time. We also use derivative financial 15 instruments to further reduce our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations. However, we cannot assure you that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries, would not materially affect our financial results. If interest rates increase, our net income could be negatively affected. We maintain levels of debt that we consider prudent based on our cash flows, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. We use debt financing to lower our cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners equity. This exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. When appropriate, we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to interest rate risks. We cannot assure you, however, that our financial risk management program will be successful in reducing the risks inherent in exposures to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, our exposure to fluctuating interest rates has increased as a result of the indebtedness we assumed in connection with the acquisition of CCEs North American business. Our interest expense may also be affected by our credit ratings. In assessing our credit strength, credit rating agencies consider our capital structure and financial policies as well as the aggregate balance sheet and other financial information for the Company. In addition, some credit rating agencies also consider financial information for certain major bottlers. It is our expectation that the credit rating agencies will continue using this methodology. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure; our major bottlers financial performance; changes in the credit rating agencies methodology in assessing our credit strength; the credit agencies perception of the impact of the continuing unfavorable credit conditions on our or our major bottlers current or future financial performance and financial condition; or for any other reason, our cost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if the credit ratings of certain bottlers in which we have equity method investments were to be downgraded, such bottlers interest expense could increase, which would reduce our equity income. We rely on our bottling partners for a significant portion of our business. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our bottling partners, our business could suffer. We generate a significant portion of our net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to independent bottling partners. As independent companies, our bottling partners, some of which are publicly traded companies, make their own business decisions that may not always align with our interests. In addition, many of our bottling partners have the right to manufacture or distribute their own products or certain products of other beverage companies. If we are unable to provide an appropriate mix of incentives to our bottling partners through a combination of pricing and marketing and advertising support, they may take actions that, while maximizing their own short term profits, may be detrimental to our Company or our brands, or they may devote more of their energy and resources to business opportunities or products other than those of the Company. Such actions could, in the long run, have an adverse effect on our profitability. If our bottling partners financial condition deteriorates, our business and financial results could be affected. We derive a significant portion of our net operating revenues from sales of concentrates and syrups to our bottling partners and, therefore, the success of our business depends on our bottling partners financial strength and profitability. While under our bottling partners agreements we generally have the right to unilaterally change the prices we charge for our concentrates and syrups, our ability to do so may be materially limited by our bottling partners financial condition and their ability to pass price increases along to their customers. In addition, we have investments in certain of our bottling partners, which we account for under the equity method, and our operating results include our proportionate share of such bottling partners income or loss. Our bottling partners financial condition is affected in large part by conditions and events that are beyond our and their control, including competitive and general market conditions in the territories in which they operate, the availability of capital and other financing resources on reasonable terms, loss of major customers, or disruptions of bottling operations that may be caused by strikes, work stoppages, labor unrest or natural disasters. A deterioration of the financial condition or results of operations of one or more of our major bottling partners could adversely affect our net operating revenues from sales of concentrates and syrups; could result in a decrease in our equity income; and could negatively affect the carrying values of our investments in bottling partners, resulting in asset write offs. 16  Increases in income tax rates or changes in income tax laws could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. We are subject to income tax in the United States and in numerous other jurisdictions in which we generate net operating revenues. Increases in income tax rates could reduce our after tax income from affected jurisdictions. In addition, there have been proposals to reform U.S. tax laws that could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. We earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will pass, several of the proposals being considered, if enacted into law, could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow. Increased or new indirect taxes in the United States or in one or more of our other major markets could negatively affect our business. Our business operations are subject to numerous duties or taxes that are not based on income, sometimes referred to as "indirect taxes," including import duties, excise taxes, sales or value added taxes, property taxes and payroll taxes, in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including indirect taxes imposed by state and local governments. In addition, in early 2009, as part of the proposed health care reform legislation, the United States Congress considered imposing a federal excise tax on beverages sweetened with sugar, HFCS or other nutritive sweeteners to offset part of the cost of implementing the proposed legislation. The proposed federal excise tax would have applied to our sparkling, juice and juice drink and sports beverages. While this proposal was not included in the health care legislation signed into law in March 2010, there is no assurance that similar proposals will not be reintroduced in the future. In addition, as federal, state and local governments experience significant budget deficits, some lawmakers have proposed singling out beverages among a plethora of revenue raising items. Increases in or the imposition of new indirect taxes on our business operations or products would increase the cost of products or, to the extent levied directly on consumers, make our products less affordable. If we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, or we or our bottling partners experience strikes, work stoppages or labor unrest, our business could suffer. Many of our associates at our key manufacturing locations and bottling plants are covered by collective bargaining agreements. With the acquisition of CCEs North American business on October 2, 2010, the number of our associates in North America represented by labor unions has substantially increased to approximately 18,600 as of December 31, 2010. If we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, our labor costs could increase, which would affect our profit margins. In addition, many of our bottling partners employees are represented by labor unions. Strikes, work stoppages or other forms of labor unrest at any of our major manufacturing facilities or at our or our major bottlers plants could impair our ability to supply concentrates and syrups to our bottling partners or our bottlers ability to supply finished beverages to customers, which would reduce our revenues and could expose us to customer claims. Increase in the cost, disruption of supply or shortage of energy could affect our profitability. CCR, our North America bottling and customer service organization, and our Company owned or controlled bottlers operate a large fleet of trucks and other motor vehicles to distribute and deliver beverage products to customers. In addition, we use a significant amount of electricity, natural gas and other energy sources to operate our concentrate plants and the bottling plants and distribution facilities operated by CCR and our Company owned or controlled bottlers. An increase in the price, disruption of supply or shortage of fuel and other energy sources in North America, in other countries in which we have concentrate plants or in any of the major markets in which our Company owned or controlled bottlers operate that may be caused by increasing demand or by events such as natural disasters, power outages or the like would increase our operating costs and negatively impact our profitability. Our bottling partners also operate large fleets of trucks and other motor vehicles to distribute and deliver beverage products to their own customers and use a significant amount of electricity, natural gas and other energy sources to operate their own bottling plants and distribution facilities. Increases in the price, disruption of supply or shortage of fuel and other energy sources in any of the major markets in which our bottling partners operate would increase the affected bottling partners operating costs and could indirectly negatively impact our results of operations. 17 Increase in the cost, disruption of supply or shortage of ingredients or packaging materials could harm our business. We and our bottling partners use various ingredients in our business, including HFCS, sucrose, aspartame, saccharin, acesulfame potassium, sucralose, ascorbic acid, citric acid, phosphoric acid and orange and other fruit juice concentrates, as well as packaging materials such as PET for bottles and aluminum for cans. The prices for these ingredients and packaging materials fluctuate depending on market conditions. Substantial increases in the prices of our or our bottling partners ingredients and packaging materials, to the extent they cannot be recouped through increases in the prices of finished beverage products, would increase our and the Coca Cola systems operating costs and could reduce our profitability. Increases in the prices of our finished products resulting from higher ingredient and packaging material costs could affect affordability in some markets and reduce Coca Cola system sales. In addition, some of these ingredients, such as aspartame, acesulfame potassium, sucralose, saccharin and ascorbic acid, as well as some of the packaging containers, such as aluminum cans, are available from a limited number of suppliers, some of which are located in countries experiencing political or other risks. We cannot assure you that we and our bottling partners will be able to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with these suppliers. An increase in the cost, a sustained interruption in the supply, or a shortage of some of these ingredients, packaging materials or cans and other containers that may be caused by a deterioration of our or our bottling partners relationships with suppliers; by supplier quality and reliability issues; or by events such as natural disasters, power outages, labor strikes, political uncertainties or governmental instability, or the like, could negatively impact our net revenues and profits. Because manufacturing and bottling operations are heavy users of ingredients and packaging materials, our Companys direct exposure to the risk of an increase in the cost, disruption of supply or shortage of ingredients or packaging materials has increased as a result of our acquisition of CCEs North American business. Changes in laws and regulations relating to beverage containers and packaging could increase our costs and reduce demand for our products. We and our bottlers currently offer nonrefillable, recyclable containers in the United States and in various other markets around the world. Legal requirements have been enacted in various jurisdictions in the United States and overseas requiring that deposits or certain ecotaxes or fees be charged for the sale, marketing and use of certain nonrefillable beverage containers. Other proposals relating to beverage container deposits, recycling, ecotax and or product stewardship have been introduced in various jurisdictions in the United States and overseas, and we anticipate that similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at local, state and federal levels, both in the United States and elsewhere. Consumers increased concerns and changing attitudes about solid waste streams and environmental responsibility and related publicity could result in the adoption of such legislation or regulations. If these types of requirements are adopted and implemented on a large scale in any of the major markets in which we operate, they could affect our costs or require changes in our distribution model, which could reduce our net operating revenues or profitability. Significant additional labeling or warning requirements may inhibit sales of affected products. Various jurisdictions may seek to adopt significant additional product labeling or warning requirements relating to the content or perceived adverse health consequences of certain of our products. If these types of requirements become applicable to one or more of our major products under current or future environmental or health laws or regulations, they may inhibit sales of such products. One such law, which is in effect in California and is generally known as Proposition 65, requires that a warning appear on any product sold in California that contains a substance that, in the view of the state, causes cancer or birth defects. The state maintains lists of these substances. This law exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products in California because it recognizes no generally applicable quantitative thresholds below which a warning is not required. Consequently, the detection of even a trace amount of a listed substance can subject an affected product to the requirement of a warning label. One or more substances that are currently on the Proposition 65 lists, or that may be added in the future, can be detected in Company products at low levels that are safe. However, Proposition 65 does not require a warning if the manufacturer of a product can demonstrate that the use of the product in question exposes consumers to a daily quantity of a listed substance that is below a "safe harbor" threshold that may be established, is naturally occurring, is the result of necessary cooking, or is subject to another applicable exception. One of the two listed substances that can presently be detected in a Company product has been shown to be naturally occurring. As to the other, the state has proposed, but not yet finally established, an inappropriately low safe harbor level that is still subject to public comment 18 and to potential legal challenge. If we were required to add warning labels under Proposition 65 on one or more of our beverage products produced for sale in California, the resulting consumer reaction to the warnings and possible adverse publicity could negatively affect our sales both in California and in other markets. Unfavorable general economic conditions in the United States or in other major markets could negatively impact our financial performance. Unfavorable general economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the United States or in one or more of our other major markets, could negatively affect the affordability of, and consumer demand for, some of our beverages. Under difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products or by shifting away from our beverages to lower priced products offered by other companies, including private label brands. Softer consumer demand for our beverages in the United States or in other major markets could reduce the Coca Cola systems profitability and could negatively affect our financial performance. Unfavorable economic and political conditions in international markets could hurt our business. We derive a significant portion of our net operating revenues from sales of our products in international markets. In 2010, our operations outside the United States accounted for approximately $24.5 billion of our net operating revenues. Unfavorable economic and political conditions in certain of our international markets, including civil unrest and governmental changes, could undermine consumer confidence and reduce consumers purchasing power, thereby reducing demand for our products. In addition, product boycotts resulting from political activism could reduce demand for our products, while restrictions on our ability to transfer earnings or capital across borders which may be imposed or expanded as a result of political and economic instability could impact our profitability. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentences, the unfavorable business environment in Venezuela, the current unstable economic and political conditions and civil unrest and political activism in the Middle East, India, Pakistan or the Philippines, the civil unrest and potential instability in Egypt and other countries in North Africa; the unstable situation in Iraq or the continuation or escalation of terrorist activities could adversely impact our international business. Litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation. We are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings. We evaluate these litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we establish reserves and or disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. We caution you that actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from those envisioned by our current assessments and estimates. In addition, we have bottling and other business operations in markets with high risk legal compliance environments. Our policies and procedures require strict compliance by our associates and agents with all United States and local laws and regulations applicable to our business operations, including those prohibiting improper payments to government officials. Nonetheless, we cannot assure you that our policies, procedures and related training programs will always ensure full compliance by our associates and agents with all applicable legal requirements. Improper conduct by our associates or agents could damage our reputation in the United States and internationally or lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines, as well as disgorgement of profits. Adverse weather conditions could reduce the demand for our products. The sales of our products are influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. Unusually cold or rainy weather during the summer months may have a temporary effect on the demand for our products and contribute to lower sales, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for such periods. If we are unable to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation, our business may suffer. Our success depends on our ability to maintain brand image for our existing products and effectively build up brand image for new products and brand extensions. We cannot assure you, however, that additional expenditures and our continuing commitment to advertising and marketing will have the desired impact on our products brand image and on 19 consumer preferences. Product quality issues, actual or perceived, or allegations of product contamination, even when false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of the affected brands and may cause consumers to choose other products. Allegations of product contamination, even if untrue, may require us from time to time to recall a beverage or other product from all of the markets in which the affected production was distributed. Product recalls could negatively affect our profitability and brand image. In some emerging markets, the production and sale of counterfeit or "spurious" products, which we and our bottling partners may not be able to fully combat, may damage the image and reputation of our products. Also, adverse publicity surrounding obesity and health concerns related to our products, water usage, labor relations and the like, and campaigns by activists attempting to connect our system to environmental issues, water shortages or workplace or human rights violations in certain countries in which we operate, could negatively affect our Companys overall reputation and our products acceptance by consumers. Changes in, or failure to comply with, the laws and regulations applicable to our products or our business operations could increase our costs or reduce our net operating revenues. Our Companys business is subject to various laws and regulations in the numerous countries throughout the world in which we do business, including laws and regulations relating to competition, product safety, advertising and labeling, container deposits, recycling or stewardship, the protection of the environment, and employment and labor practices. In the United States, the production, distribution and sale of many of our products are subject to, among others, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Lanham Act, state consumer protection laws, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, various environmental statutes, as well as various state and local statutes and regulations. Outside the United States, the production, distribution, sale, advertising and labeling of many of our products are also subject to various laws and regulations. Changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof, including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change or to limit or eliminate the use of bisphenol A, or BPA (an odorless, tasteless food grade chemical commonly used in the food and beverage industries as a component in the coating of the interior of cans), may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us and our bottling partners, which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products, which could affect our net operating revenues. In addition, failure to comply with environmental, health or safety requirements and other applicable laws or regulations could result in the assessment of damages, the imposition of penalties, suspension of production, changes to equipment or processes or a cessation of operations at our or our bottling partners facilities, as well as damage to our and the Coca Cola systems image and reputation, all of which could harm our and the Coca Cola systems profitability. Changes in accounting standards could affect our reported financial results. New accounting standards or pronouncements that may become applicable to our Company from time to time, or changes in the interpretation of existing standards and pronouncements, could have a significant effect on our reported results for the affected periods. If we are not able to achieve our overall long term goals, the value of an investment in our Company could be negatively affected. We have established and publicly announced certain long term growth objectives. These objectives were based on our evaluation of our growth prospects, which are generally based on volume and sales potential of many product types, some of which are more profitable than others, and on an assessment of the potential price and product mix. There can be no assurance that we will achieve the required volume or revenue growth or the mix of products necessary to achieve our long term growth objectives. If we are unable to protect our information technology infrastructure against service interruptions, data corruption, cyber based attacks or network security breaches, our operations could be disrupted. We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement and supply chain, manufacturing, distribution and invoicing and collection of payments for concentrate or finished products. We use enterprise information technology systems to record, process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax 20 requirements. In addition, we depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and electronic communications among our locations around the world and between Company personnel and our bottlers and other customers and suppliers. Our information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. In addition, security breaches could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we may lose revenue and profits as a result of our inability to timely manufacture, distribute, invoice and collect payments for concentrate or finished products, and could experience delays in reporting our financial results. In addition, if we are unable to prevent security breaches, we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to us or to our bottling partners, customers or suppliers. We may be required to recognize additional impairment charges which could materially affect our financial results. We assess our goodwill, trademarks and other intangible assets as well as our other long lived assets as and when required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States to determine whether they are impaired and, if they are, we record appropriate impairment charges. Our equity method investees also perform impairment tests, and we record our proportionate share of impairment charges recorded by them adjusted, as appropriate, for the impact of items such as basis differences, deferred taxes and deferred gains. For example, in 2010 we recorded charges of approximately $41 million to other income (loss) net related to other than temporary impairments of available for sale securities and an equity method investment; in 2009 we recorded charges of approximately $40 million related to asset impairments due to a change in the expected useful life of an intangible asset and a change in disposal strategy related to a building that is no longer occupied, and charges of approximately $27 million to other income (loss) net due to an other than temporary decline in the fair value of a cost method investment; and in 2008 we recorded charges of approximately $1.6 billion to equity income (loss) net, representing our proportionate share of impairment charges recorded by CCE, and a charge of approximately $81 million to other income (loss) net related to other than temporary declines in the fair value of certain available for sale securities. It is possible that we may be required to record significant impairment charges or our proportionate share of significant charges recorded by equity investees in the future and, if we do so, our operating or equity income could be materially adversely affected. If we do not successfully integrate and manage our Company owned or controlled bottling operations, our results could suffer. From time to time we acquire or take control of bottling operations, often in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance. We may incur unforeseen liabilities and obligations in connection with acquiring, taking control of or managing bottling operations and may encounter unexpected difficulties and costs in restructuring and integrating them into our Companys operating and internal control structures. We may also experience delays in extending our Companys internal control over financial reporting to newly acquired or controlled bottling operations, which may increase the risk of failure to prevent misstatements in such operations financial records and in our consolidated financial statements. In 2010, net operating revenues generated by our Bottling Investments group (which includes Company owned or controlled bottling operations other than those managed by CCR) represented approximately 23 percent of our Companys consolidated net operating revenues. Our financial performance depends in large part on how well we can manage and improve the performance of Company owned or controlled bottling operations. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to achieve our strategic and financial objectives for such bottling operations. If we are unable to achieve such objectives, our consolidated results could be negatively affected. Climate change may negatively affect our business. There is increasing concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions as a result of changing weather patterns may limit availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities, such as sugarcane, corn, beets, citrus, coffee and tea, which are important ingredients for our products. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our 21 supply chain or impact demand for our products. Climate change may also exacerbate water scarcity and cause a further deterioration of water quality in affected regions, which could limit water availability for our systems bottling operations. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long term adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Global or regional catastrophic events could impact our operations and financial results. Because of our global presence and worldwide operations, our business can be affected by large scale terrorist acts, especially those directed against the United States or other major industrialized countries; the outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities; major natural disasters; or widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases such as H1N1 influenza, avian influenza or severe acute respiratory syndrome (generally known as SARS). Such events could impair our ability to manage our business around the world, could disrupt our supply of raw materials, and could impact production, transportation and delivery of concentrates, syrups and finished products. In addition, such events could cause disruption of regional or global economic activity, which can affect consumers purchasing power in the affected areas and, therefore, reduce demand for our products.  ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable.  ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our worldwide headquarters is located on a 35 acre office complex in Atlanta, Georgia. The complex includes the approximately 621,000 square foot headquarters building and an approximately 870,000 square foot building in which CCNAs and CCRs main offices are located. The complex also includes several other buildings, including the approximately 264,000 square foot Coca Cola Plaza building, technical and engineering facilities, a learning center and a reception center. We also own an office and retail building at 711 Fifth Avenue in New York, New York. These properties are primarily included in the Corporate operating segment. We own or lease additional facilities, real estate and office space throughout the world which we use for administrative, manufacturing, processing, packaging, packing, storage, warehousing, distribution and retail operations. These properties are generally included in the geographic operating segment in which they are located. In North America, as of December 31, 2010, we owned 65 beverage production facilities, 10 principal beverage concentrate and or syrup manufacturing plants, one facility that manufactures juice concentrates for foodservice use and four bottled water facilities; we leased one bottled water facility and one beverage production facility; and we operated 299 principal beverage distribution warehouses of which 112 are leased and the rest are owned. Also included in the North America operating segment is a portion of the Atlanta office complex. Additionally, as of December 31, 2010, our Company owned and operated 20 principal beverage concentrate manufacturing plants outside of North America, of which four are included in the Eurasia and Africa operating segment, three are included in the Europe operating segment, five are included in the Latin America operating segment, and eight are included in the Pacific operating segment. We own or hold a majority interest in or otherwise consolidate under applicable accounting rules bottling operations that, as of December 31, 2010, owned 98 principal beverage bottling and canning plants located throughout the world. These plants are included in the Bottling Investments operating segment. Management believes that our Companys facilities for the production of our products are suitable and adequate, that they are being appropriately utilized in line with past experience, and that they have sufficient production capacity for their present intended purposes. The extent of utilization of such facilities varies based upon seasonal demand for our products. However, management believes that additional production can be obtained at the existing facilities by adding personnel and capital equipment and, at some facilities, by adding shifts of personnel or expanding the facilities. We continuously review our anticipated requirements for facilities and, on the basis of that review, may from time to time acquire additional facilities and or dispose of existing facilities. 22   ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company is involved in various legal proceedings, including the proceedings specifically discussed below. Management of the Company believes that any liability to the Company that may arise as a result of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole. CCE Shareowners Litigation Delaware Shortly following the announcement of the agreement for the Companys acquisition of CCEs North American operations, purported shareowners of CCE filed five substantially identical putative class action lawsuits in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against CCE, the members of the Board of Directors of CCE and the Company. These lawsuits were subsequently consolidated into one action styled In Re CCE Shareholders Litigation (Consolidated C.A. No. 5291 VCN). On March 31, 2010, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. On June 25, 2010, the plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint. In the amended consolidated complaint, the plaintiffs allege, among other things, that CCE, CCEs directors and the Company have violated Delaware law by not submitting the sale of CCEs North American operations to a separate vote of CCEs shareowners; and that CCEs directors breached their fiduciary duties to CCE and its shareowners by approving the transaction for grossly inadequate consideration, and that the Company aided and abetted such breach. The plaintiffs further allege that by virtue of its stock ownership in CCE, representation on the Board of Directors of CCE and various agreements and business relationships with CCE, the Company dominated and controlled CCE during the relevant period and therefore had a fiduciary duty to CCEs public shareowners which the Company breached because, among other things, the transaction is not entirely fair and that both CCE and the Company failed to adequately disclose certain aspects of the transaction, the disclosure of which would have been necessary to fully inform a decision to vote for or against same. In the amended consolidated complaint, the plaintiffs seek a judgment enjoining the closing of the transaction and declaring the transaction unlawful and unenforceable (this request for relief has become moot upon the closing of the CCE transaction on October 2, 2010), and ordering rescission, directing defendants to account for all damages, profits, special benefits and unjust enrichment, awarding the costs and disbursements of the action, including reasonable attorneys fees, accountants and experts fees, costs and expenses, and granting such other relief as the court deems just and proper. On or about July 15, 2010, the Company, CCE and the other defendants filed separate answers to the amended consolidated complaint. On September 3, 2010, the parties to the consolidated Georgia litigation described below executed a memorandum of understanding (the "MOU") containing the terms for the parties agreement in principle to settle the lawsuits. On January 14, 2011, the parties to the consolidated Delaware litigation and the consolidated Georgia litigation entered into a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise and Settlement (the "Settlement Stipulation") to resolve, subject to court approval, the consolidated Delaware litigation and the consolidated Georgia litigation. A preliminary approval hearing on the settlement has been set for March 3, 2011, and the final approval hearing for June 8, 2011. Pursuant to the Settlement Stipulation, the parties in the consolidated Delaware litigation will use their best efforts to obtain the dismissal with prejudice of the consolidated Delaware litigation within five business days of the final approval of the settlement by the Georgia court. The Company believes that the allegations in the consolidated Delaware litigation are without merit and, in the event such litigation is not dismissed as contemplated by the MOU, intends to defend vigorously its interests. CCE Shareowners Litigation Georgia Shortly following the announcement of the agreement for the Companys acquisition of CCEs North American operations, purported shareowners of CCE filed three putative class action lawsuits in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia against the Company, CCE and the members of the Board of Directors of CCE. These lawsuits were subsequently consolidated into one action styled In Re The Coca Cola Company Shareholder Litigation (Civil Action No. 2010cv182035). On May 17, 2010, the consolidated action was transferred to the Business Case Division of the Fulton County Superior Court. 23 On or about June 3, 2010, an amended consolidated complaint was filed. On July 6, 2010, the Company and all other defendants answered the amended consolidated complaint and filed motions to dismiss the amended consolidated complaint and for an order staying discovery. On July 6, 2010, the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification. In the amended consolidated complaint, the plaintiffs allege, among other things, that by virtue of its stock ownership in and business dealings with CCE, the Company controlled and dominated CCE during the relevant period and therefore owed to CCE a duty of entire fairness and a duty not to misuse its control of CCE for its own ends which the Company allegedly breached because, among other things, the transaction is not entirely fair; and that the Company, CCE and CCEs directors have violated Delaware law by not submitting the transaction to a separate vote of CCEs shareowners. In the amended consolidated complaint, the plaintiffs seek a judgment enjoining the closing of the proposed transaction and declaring the proposed transaction void (this request for relief has become moot upon the closing of the CCE transaction on October 2, 2010), and ordering rescission, requiring disgorgement of profits, awarding damages, awarding reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, and granting such other relief as the court deems just and proper. Pursuant to the above referenced MOU, and in consideration for the settlement of the consolidated Delaware litigation and the consolidated Georgia litigation, prior to executing the Settlement Stipulation, the parties to the CCE transaction made certain amendments to the merger agreement and certain supplemental disclosures in connection with the proxy statement sent to the CCE shareowners soliciting approval of the merger. The settlement contemplated by the Settlement Stipulation is subject to court approval and, if approved, would result in the dismissal with prejudice of the consolidated Georgia litigation and the release by the plaintiff class of all claims under federal and state law that were or could have been asserted in the consolidated Georgia litigation or the consolidated Delaware litigation or which arise out of or relate to the transactions contemplated by the merger. A preliminary approval hearing on the settlement has been set for March 3, 2011, and the final approval hearing for June 8, 2011. In addition, pursuant to the Settlement Stipulation, the parties in the consolidated Delaware litigation will use their best efforts to obtain the dismissal with prejudice of the consolidated Delaware litigation described above within five business days of the final approval of the settlement by the Georgia court. The Company believes that the allegations in the consolidated Georgia litigation are without merit and if the settlement is not approved by the Georgia court, intends to defend vigorously its interests. Aqua Chem Litigation On December 20, 2002, the Company filed a lawsuit (The Coca Cola Company v. Aqua Chem, Inc., Civil Action No. 2002CV631 50) in the Superior Court, Fulton County, Georgia (the "Georgia Case"), seeking a declaratory judgment that the Company has no obligation to its former subsidiary, Aqua Chem, Inc., now known as Cleaver Brooks, Inc. ("Aqua Chem"), for any past, present or future liabilities or expenses in connection with any claims or lawsuits against Aqua Chem. Subsequent to the Companys filing but on the same day, Aqua Chem filed a lawsuit (Aqua Chem, Inc. v. The Coca Cola Company, Civil Action No. 02CV012179) in the Circuit Court, Civil Division of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin (the "Wisconsin Case"). In the Wisconsin Case, Aqua Chem sought a declaratory judgment that the Company is responsible for all liabilities and expenses not covered by insurance in connection with certain of Aqua Chems general and product liability claims arising from occurrences prior to the Companys sale of Aqua Chem in 1981, and a judgment for breach of contract in an amount exceeding $9 million for costs incurred by Aqua Chem to date in connection with such claims. The Wisconsin Case initially was stayed, pending final resolution of the Georgia Case, and later was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice by Aqua Chem. The Company owned Aqua Chem from 1970 to 1981. During that time, the Company purchased over $400 million of insurance coverage, which also insures Aqua Chem for some of its prior and future costs for certain product liability and other claims. The Company sold Aqua Chem to Lyonnaise American Holding, Inc., in 1981 under the terms of a stock sale agreement. The 1981 agreement, and a subsequent 1983 settlement agreement, outlined the parties rights and obligations concerning past and future claims and lawsuits involving Aqua Chem. Cleaver Brooks, a division of Aqua Chem, manufactured boilers, some of which contained asbestos gaskets. Aqua Chem was first named as a defendant in asbestos lawsuits in or around 1985 and currently has approximately 40,000 claims pending against it. The parties agreed in 2004 to stay the Georgia Case pending the outcome of insurance coverage litigation filed by certain Aqua Chem insurers on March 26, 2004. In the coverage action, five plaintiff insurance companies filed suit 24 (Century Indemnity Company, et al. v. Aqua Chem, Inc., The Coca Cola Company, et al., Case No. 04CV002852) in the Circuit Court, Civil Division of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, against the Company, Aqua Chem and 16 insurance companies. Several of the policies that were the subject of the coverage action had been issued to the Company during the period (1970 to 1981) when the Company owned Aqua Chem. The complaint sought a determination of the respective rights and obligations under the insurance policies issued with regard to asbestos related claims against Aqua Chem. The action also sought a monetary judgment reimbursing any amounts paid by the plaintiffs in excess of their obligations. Two of the insurers, one with a $15 million policy limit and one with a $25 million policy limit, asserted cross claims against the Company, alleging that the Company and or its insurers are responsible for Aqua Chems asbestos liabilities before any obligation is triggered on the part of the cross claimant insurers to pay for such costs under their policies. Aqua Chem and the Company filed and obtained a partial summary judgment determination in the coverage action that the insurers for Aqua Chem and the Company were jointly and severally liable for coverage amounts, but reserving judgment on other defenses that might apply. During the course of the Wisconsin coverage litigation, Aqua Chem and the Company reached settlements with several of the insurers, including plaintiffs, who have paid or will pay funds into an escrow account for payment of costs arising from the asbestos claims against Aqua Chem. On July 24, 2007, the Wisconsin trial court entered a final declaratory judgment regarding the rights and obligations of the parties under the insurance policies issued by the remaining defendant insurers, which judgment was not appealed. The judgment directs, among other things, that each insurer whose policy is triggered is jointly and severally liable for 100 percent of Aqua Chems losses up to policy limits. The Company and Aqua Chem have continued to pursue and obtain coverage agreements for the asbestos related claims against Aqua Chem with those insurance companies that did not settle in the Wisconsin coverage litigation. The courts judgment concluded the Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation. The Georgia Case remains subject to the stay agreed to in 2004. Chapman On June 30, 2005, Maryann Chapman filed a purported shareholder derivative action (Chapman v. Isdell, et al.) in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia, alleging violations of state law by certain individual current and former members of the Board of Directors of the Company and senior management, including breaches of fiduciary duties, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment, between January 2003 and the date of filing of the complaint that have caused substantial losses to the Company and other damages, such as to its reputation and goodwill. The defendants named in the lawsuit include Neville Isdell, Douglas Daft, Gary Fayard, Ronald Allen, Cathleen Black, Warren Buffett, Herbert Allen, Barry Diller, Donald McHenry, Sam Nunn, James Robinson, Peter Ueberroth, James Williams, Donald Keough, Maria Lagomasino, Pedro Reinhard, Robert Nardelli and Susan Bennett King. The Company is also named a nominal defendant. The complaint further alleges that the September 2004 earnings warning issued by the Company resulted from factors known by the individual defendants as early as January 2003 that were not adequately disclosed to the investing public until the earnings warning. The factors cited in the complaint include (i) a flawed business strategy and a business model that was not working; (ii) a workforce so depleted by layoffs that it was unable to properly react to changing market conditions; (iii) impaired relationships with key bottlers; and (iv) the fact that the foregoing conditions would lead to diminished earnings. The plaintiff, purportedly on behalf of the Company, seeks damages in an unspecified amount, extraordinary equitable and or injunctive relief, restitution and disgorgement of profits, reimbursement for costs and disbursements of the action, and such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper. The Companys motion to dismiss the complaint and the plaintiffs response were filed and fully briefed. The Court heard oral argument on the Companys motion to dismiss on June 6, 2006. Following the hearing, the Court took the matter under advisement and the parties are awaiting a ruling. There were no material developments in this case during 2010. The Company intends to vigorously defend its interests in this matter. 25  ITEM 4. [REMOVED AND RESERVED]  ITEM X.

We own or license and market more than 500 nonalcoholic beverage brands, primarily sparkling beverages but also a variety of still beverages such as waters, enhanced waters, juices and juice drinks, ready to drink teas and coffees, and energy and sports drinks. Along with Coca Cola, which is recognized as the worlds most valuable brand, we own and market four of the worlds top five nonalcoholic sparkling beverage brands, including Diet Coke, Fanta and Sprite. Finished beverage products bearing our trademarks, sold in the United States since 1886, are now sold in more than 200 countries. We make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of Company owned or controlled bottling and distribution operations, bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers the worlds largest beverage distribution system. Of the approximately 55 billion beverage servings of all types consumed worldwide every day, beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us account for approximately 1.7 billion. We believe that our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide variety of choices to meet their desires, needs and lifestyle choices. Our success further depends on the ability of our people to execute effectively, every day. Our goal is to use our Companys assets our brands, financial strength, unrivaled distribution system, global reach and the talent and strong commitment of our management and associates to become more competitive and to accelerate growth in a manner that creates value for our shareowners. Our Company markets, manufactures and sells: beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as "beverage bases," and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our "concentrate business" or "concentrate operations"); and finished sparkling and still beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our "finished products business" or "finished products operations"). Generally, finished products operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations. In our concentrate operations, we typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to authorized bottling and canning operations (to which we typically refer as our "bottlers" or our "bottling partners"). Our bottling partners either combine the concentrates with sweeteners (depending on the product), still water and or sparkling water or combine the syrups with sparkling water to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us such as cans and refillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through wholesalers or other bottlers. Outside the United States, we also sell concentrates for fountain beverages to our bottling partners who are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, which they sell to fountain retailers such as restaurants and convenience stores which use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. Our finished products operations consist primarily of the production, sales and distribution operations managed by CCR and our Company owned or controlled bottling and distribution operations. CCR is included in our North America operating segment, and our Company owned or controlled bottling and distribution operations are included in our Bottling Investments operating segment. Our finished products operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling beverages and a variety of still beverages, such as juices and juice drinks, energy and sports drinks, ready to drink teas and coffees, and certain water products, to retailers or to distributors, wholesalers and bottling partners who distribute them to retailers. In addition, in the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers such as restaurants and convenience stores who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. In the United States, we authorize wholesalers to resell our fountain syrups through nonexclusive appointments that neither restrict us in setting the prices at which we sell fountain syrups to the wholesalers nor restrict the territories in which the wholesalers may resell in the United States. 34 The following table sets forth the percentage of total net operating revenues related to concentrate operations and finished products operations, respectively: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Concentrate operations1 51 % 54 % 54 % Finished products operations2 49 3 46 46 Net operating revenues 100 % 100 % 100 % 1 Includes concentrates sold by the Company to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of fountain syrups.

The following table sets forth the percentage of total worldwide unit case volume related to concentrate operations and finished products operations, respectively: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Concentrate operations1 76 % 78 % 77 % Finished products operations2 24 3 22 23 Total worldwide unit case volume 100 % 100 % 100 % 1 Includes unit case volume related to concentrates sold by the Company to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of fountain syrups. The bottlers then typically sell the fountain syrups to wholesalers or directly to fountain retailers. 2 Includes unit case volume related to fountain syrups manufactured by the Company, including consolidated bottling operations, and sold to fountain retailers or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. 3 Includes unit case volume related to the acquired CCE North American business from October 2, 2010. Acquisition of CCEs North American Business and Related Transactions Pursuant to the terms of the business separation and merger agreement entered into on February 25, 2010, as amended (the "merger agreement"), on October 2, 2010 (the "acquisition date"), we acquired CCEs North American business, consisting of CCEs production, sales and distribution operations in the United States, Canada, the British Virgin Islands, the United States Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands, and a substantial majority of CCEs corporate segment. We believe this acquisition will result in an evolved franchise system that will enable us to better serve the unique needs of the North American market. The creation of a unified operating system will strategically position us to better market and distribute our nonalcoholic beverage brands in North America. Under the terms of the merger agreement, the Company acquired the 67 percent of CCEs North American business that was not already owned by the Company for consideration that included: (1) the Companys 33 percent indirect ownership interest in CCEs European operations; (2) cash consideration; and (3) replacement awards issued to certain current and former employees of CCEs North American and corporate operations. At closing, CCE shareowners other than the Company exchanged their CCE common stock for common stock in a new entity, which was renamed Coca Cola Enterprises, Inc. (which is referred to herein as "New CCE") and which continues to hold the European operations held by CCE prior to the acquisition. At closing, New CCE became 100 percent owned by shareowners that held shares of common stock of CCE immediately prior to the closing, other than the Company. As a result of this transaction, the Company does not own any interest in New CCE. As of October 1, 2010, our Company owned approximately 33 percent of the outstanding common stock of CCE. Based on the closing price of CCEs common stock on the last day of trading prior to the acquisition date, the fair value of our investment in CCE was approximately $5,373 million, which reflected the fair value of our ownership in both CCEs North American business and its European operations. We remeasured our equity interest in CCE to fair value upon 35 the close of the transaction. As a result, we recognized a gain of approximately $4,978 million, which was classified in the line item other income (loss) net in our consolidated statement of income. The gain included a $137 million reclassification adjustment related to foreign currency translation gains recognized upon the disposal of our indirect investment in CCEs European operations. The Company relinquished its indirect ownership interest in CCEs European operations to New CCE as part of the consideration to acquire the 67 percent of CCEs North American business that was not already owned by the Company. Although the CCE transaction was structured to be primarily cashless, under the terms of the merger agreement, we agreed to assume approximately $8.9 billion of CCE debt. In the event that the actual CCE debt on the acquisition date was less than the agreed amount, we agreed to make a cash payment to New CCE for the difference. As of the acquisition date, the debt assumed by the Company was approximately $7.9 billion. The total cash consideration paid to New CCE as part of the transaction was approximately $1.3 billion, which included approximately $1.0 billion related to the debt shortfall. In contemplation of the closing of our acquisition of CCEs North American business, we reached an agreement with DPS to distribute certain DPS brands in territories where DPS brands had been distributed by CCE prior to the CCE transaction. Under the terms of our agreement with DPS, concurrently with the closing of the CCE transaction, we entered into license agreements with DPS to distribute Dr Pepper trademark brands in the U.S., Canada Dry in the Northeast U.S., and Canada Dry and C Plus in Canada, and we made a net one time cash payment of $715 million to DPS. Under the license agreements, the Company agreed to meet certain performance obligations to distribute DPS products in retail and foodservice accounts and vending machines. The license agreements have initial terms of 20 years, with automatic 20 year renewal periods unless otherwise terminated under the terms of the agreements. The license agreements replaced agreements between DPS and CCE existing immediately prior to the completion of the CCE transaction. In addition, we entered into an agreement with DPS to include Dr Pepper and Diet Dr Pepper in our Coca Cola Freestyle fountain dispensers in certain outlets throughout the United States. The Coca Cola Freestyle agreement has a term of 20 years. On October 2, 2010, we sold all of our ownership interests in our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE for approximately $0.9 billion in cash. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of CCEs North American business, we granted to New CCE the right to acquire our majority interest in our German bottler at any time from 18 to 39 months after February 25, 2010, at the then current fair value and subject to terms and conditions as mutually agreed. The Nonalcoholic Beverages Segment of the Commercial Beverages Industry We operate in the highly competitive nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry. We face strong competition from numerous other general and specialty beverage companies. We, along with other beverage companies, are affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, cost to manufacture and distribute products, consumer spending, economic conditions, availability and quality of water, consumer preferences, inflation, political climate, local and national laws and regulations, foreign currency exchange fluctuations, fuel prices and weather patterns. Our Objective Our objective is to use our formidable assets brands, financial strength, unrivaled distribution system, global reach, and a strong commitment by our management and associates worldwide to achieve long term sustainable growth. Our vision for sustainable growth includes the following: People: Being a great place to work where people are inspired to be the best they can be. Portfolio: Bringing to the world a portfolio of beverage brands that anticipates and satisfies peoples desires and needs. Partners: Nurturing a winning network of partners and building mutual loyalty. Planet: Being a responsible global citizen that makes a difference. Profit: Maximizing return to shareowners while being mindful of our overall responsibilities. Productivity: Managing our people, time and money for greatest effectiveness. 36 Strategic Priorities We have four strategic priorities designed to create long term sustainable growth for our Company and the Coca Cola system and value for our shareowners. These strategic priorities are driving global beverage leadership; accelerating innovation; leveraging our balanced geographic portfolio; and leading the Coca Cola system for growth. To enable the entire Coca Cola system so that we can deliver on these strategic priorities, we must further enhance our core capabilities of consumer marketing; commercial leadership; franchise leadership; and bottling and distribution operations. Core Capabilities Consumer Marketing Marketing investments are designed to enhance consumer awareness of and increase consumer preference for our brands. This produces long term growth in unit case volume, per capita consumption and our share of worldwide nonalcoholic beverage sales. Through our relationships with our bottling partners and those who sell our products in the marketplace, we create and implement integrated marketing programs, both globally and locally, that are designed to heighten consumer awareness of and product appeal for our brands. In developing a strategy for a Company brand, we conduct product and packaging research, establish brand positioning, develop precise consumer communications and solicit consumer feedback. Our integrated marketing activities include, but are not limited to, advertising, point of sale merchandising and sales promotions. We have disciplined marketing strategies that focus on driving volume in emerging markets, increasing our brand value in developing markets and growing profit in our most developed markets. In emerging markets, we are investing in infrastructure programs that drive volume through increased access to consumers. In developing markets, where consumer access has largely been established, our focus is on differentiating our brands. In our most developed markets, we continue to invest in brands and infrastructure programs, but at a slower rate than revenue growth. We are focused on affordability and ensuring we are communicating the appropriate message based on the current economic environment. Commercial Leadership The Coca Cola system has millions of customers around the world who sell or serve our products directly to consumers. We focus on enhancing value for our customers and providing solutions to grow their beverage businesses. Our approach includes understanding each customers business and needs, whether that customer is a sophisticated retailer in a developed market or a kiosk owner in an emerging market. We focus on ensuring that our customers have the right product and package offerings and the right promotional tools to deliver enhanced value to themselves and the Company. We are constantly looking to build new beverage consumption occasions in our customers outlets through unique and innovative consumer experiences, product availability and delivery systems, and beverage merchandising and displays. We participate in joint brand building initiatives with our customers in order to drive customer preference for our brands. Through our commercial leadership initiatives, we embed ourselves further into our retail customers businesses while developing strategies for better execution at the point of sale. Franchise Leadership We must continue to improve our franchise leadership capabilities to give our Company and our bottling partners the ability to grow together through shared values, aligned incentives and a sense of urgency and flexibility that supports consumers always changing needs and tastes. The financial health and success of our bottling partners are critical components of the Companys success. We work with our bottling partners to identify system requirements that enable us to quickly achieve scale and efficiencies, and we share best practices throughout the bottling system. Our system leadership allows us to leverage recent acquisitions to expand our volume base and enhance margins. With our bottling partners, we work to produce differentiated beverages and packages that are appropriate for the right channels and consumers. We also design business models for sparkling and still beverages in specific markets to ensure that we appropriately share the value created by these beverages with our bottling partners. We will continue to build a supply chain network that leverages the size and scale of the Coca Cola system to gain a competitive advantage. 37 Bottling and Distribution Operations While most of our Company beverage products are manufactured, sold and distributed by independently owned and managed bottling partners, the Company has had a significant increase in the number of consolidated bottling and distribution operations over the last several years. We often acquire bottlers in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance. Owning such a controlling interest enables us to compensate for limited local resources; help focus the bottlers sales and marketing programs; assist in the development of the bottlers business and information systems; and establish an appropriate capital structure for the bottler. As a Company we have a long history of providing world class customer service, demonstrating leadership in the marketplace and leveraging the talent of our global workforce. In addition, we have an experienced bottler management team. All of these factors are critical to build upon as we manage our growing bottling and distribution operations. The Company has a deep commitment to continuously improving our business. This includes our efforts to develop innovative packaging and merchandising solutions which help drive demand for our beverages and meet the growing needs of our consumers. As we further transform the way we go to market the Company continues to seek out ways to be more efficient. Challenges and Risks Being a global company provides unique opportunities for our Company. Challenges and risks accompany those opportunities. Our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of the nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry and our Company. Of these, four key challenges and risks are discussed below. Obesity and Inactive Lifestyles. Increasing concern among consumers, public health professionals and government agencies of the potential health problems associated with obesity and inactive lifestyles represents a significant challenge to our industry. We recognize that obesity is a complex public health problem. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line, which includes a wide selection of diet and light beverages, juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and water products. Our commitment also includes adhering to responsible policies in schools and in the marketplace; supporting programs to encourage physical activity and promote nutrition education; and continuously meeting changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. We are committed to playing an appropriate role in helping address this issue in cooperation with governments, educators and consumers through science based solutions and programs. Water Quality and Quantity. Water quality and quantity is an issue that increasingly requires our Companys attention and collaboration with the nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry, governments, nongovernmental organizations and communities where we operate. Water is the main ingredient in substantially all of our products. It is also a limited natural resource facing unprecedented challenges from overexploitation, increasing pollution and poor management. Our Company is in an excellent position to share the water related knowledge we have developed in the communities we serve water resource management, water treatment, wastewater treatment systems, and models for working with communities and partners in addressing water and sanitation needs. We are actively engaged in assessing the specific water related risks that we and many of our bottling partners face and have implemented a formal water risk management program. We are working with our global partners to develop water sustainability projects. We are actively encouraging improved water efficiency and conservation efforts throughout our system. As demand for water continues to increase around the world, we expect commitment and continued action on our part will be crucial in the successful long term stewardship of this critical natural resource. Evolving Consumer Preferences. Consumers want more choices. We are impacted by shifting consumer demographics and needs, on the go lifestyles, aging populations in developed markets and consumers who are empowered with more information than ever. We are committed to generating new avenues for growth through our core brands with a focus on diet and light products. We are also committed to continuing to expand the variety of choices we provide to consumers to meet their needs, desires and lifestyle choices. 38 Increased Competition and Capabilities in the Marketplace. Our Company is facing strong competition from some well established global companies and many local participants. We must continue to selectively expand into other profitable segments of the nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry and strengthen our capabilities in marketing and innovation in order to maintain our brand loyalty and market share. All four of these challenges and risks obesity and inactive lifestyles, water quality and quantity, evolving consumer preferences, and increased competition and capabilities in the marketplace have the potential to have a material adverse effect on the nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry and on our Company; however, we believe our Company is well positioned to appropriately address these challenges and risks. See also "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in Part I of this report for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following: Basis of Presentation Principles of Consolidation Purchase Accounting for Acquisitions Recoverability of Noncurrent Assets Pension Plan Valuations Revenue Recognition Income Taxes Contingencies Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Companys Board of Directors. While our estimates and assumptions are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions. For a discussion of the Companys significant accounting policies, refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Basis of Presentation Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from estimates and assumptions. Furthermore, when testing assets for impairment in future periods, if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur, impairment charges may result. We use the equity method to account for investments in companies if our investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the investee. Our consolidated net income includes our Companys proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies. The carrying values of our equity method investments are increased or decreased by our proportionate share of the net income or loss and other comprehensive income (loss) ("OCI") of these companies. The carrying values of our equity method investments are also decreased by dividends we receive from the investees. Our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy making decisions and material intercompany transactions. 39  We eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions, including the intercompany transactions with consolidated VIEs and the intercompany portion of transactions with equity method investees. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States provide entities the option to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value, with the change in fair value being included in the determination of net income. The Company has currently chosen not to elect the fair value option; and therefore, we only measure assets and liabilities at fair value if required under other accounting guidance. Certain amounts in the prior years consolidated financial statements and notes have been revised to conform to the current year presentation. Principles of Consolidation Our Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest as well as VIEs for which our Company is the primary beneficiary. Generally, we consolidate only business enterprises that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest. However, there are situations in which consolidation is required even though the usual condition of consolidation (ownership of a majority voting interest) does not apply. Generally, this occurs when an entity holds an interest in another business enterprise that was achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship between such entitys voting interests in, and its exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of, the other business enterprise. This disproportionate relationship results in what is known as a variable interest, and the entity in which we have the variable interest is referred to as a VIE. An enterprise must consolidate a VIE if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary has both (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance, and (b) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Our Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling and container manufacturing operations, for which we were not determined to be the primary beneficiary. Our variable interests in these VIEs primarily relate to profit guarantees or subordinated financial support. Refer to Note 11. Although these financial arrangements resulted in us holding variable interests in these entities, the majority of these arrangements did not empower us to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance. Our Companys investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs totaled approximately $1,274 million and $624 million as of December 31, 2010, and 2009, respectively, representing our maximum exposures to loss. The Companys investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs were not significant to the Companys consolidated financial statements. In addition, our Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling and container manufacturing operations, for which we were determined to be the primary beneficiary. Our Companys investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs totaled approximately $191 million and $84 million as of December 31, 2010, and 2009, respectively, representing our maximum exposures to loss. The assets and liabilities of VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary were not significant to the Companys consolidated financial statements. Creditors of our VIEs do not have recourse against the general credit of the Company, regardless of whether they are accounted for as consolidated entities. The information presented above reflects the impact of the Companys adoption of accounting guidance issued by the FASB related to VIEs in June 2009. This accounting guidance resulted in a change in our accounting policy effective January 1, 2010. Among other things, the guidance requires more qualitative than quantitative analyses to determine the primary beneficiary of a VIE, requires continuous assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, enhances disclosures about an enterprises involvement with a VIE, and amends certain guidance for determining whether an entity is a VIE. Beginning January 1, 2010, we deconsolidated certain entities as a result of this change in accounting policy. These entities are primarily bottling operations and had previously been consolidated due to certain loan guarantees and or other financial support given by the Company. These financial arrangements, although not significant to our consolidated financial statements, resulted in a disproportionate relationship between our voting interests in these entities and our exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of the entities. As a result, we determined that we held a majority of the variable interests in these entities and, therefore, were deemed to be the primary beneficiary 40 in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States as of December 31, 2009. Although these financial arrangements resulted in us holding a majority of the variable interests in these VIEs, the majority of these arrangements did not empower us to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance. Consequently, subsequent to the change in accounting policy, the Company deconsolidated the majority of these VIEs. The entities that have been deconsolidated accounted for less than 1 percent of net income attributable to shareowners of The Coca Cola Company in 2009, and we have accounted for these entities under the equity method of accounting since January 1, 2010. Although the deconsolidation of these entities impacted individual line items in our consolidated financial statements, the impact on net income attributable to shareowners of The Coca Cola Company in future periods will be nominal. The equity method of accounting is intended to be a single line consolidation and, therefore, generally should result in the same net income attributable to the investor as would be the case if the investee had been consolidated. The main impact on our consolidated financial statements in 2010 was that, instead of these entities results of operations and balance sheets affecting our consolidated line items, our proportionate share of net income or loss from these entities was reported in equity income (loss) net, in our consolidated income statements, and our investment in these entities was reported as equity method investments in our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to the heading "Structural Changes and New License Agreements" for additional information. Purchase Accounting for Acquisitions The Company adopted new guidance issued by the FASB on January 1, 2009, which changed the application of the acquisition method of accounting in a business combination and also modified the way assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized on a prospective basis. In general, the acquisition method of accounting requires companies to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition. We estimate fair value using the exit price approach which is defined as the price that would be received if we sold an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly market. The value of an exit price is determined from the viewpoint of all market participants as a whole and may result in the Company valuing assets at a fair value that is not reflective of our intended use of the assets. Any amount of the purchase price paid that is in excess of the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded in the line item goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets. Managements judgment is used to determine the estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives for property, plant and equipment and amortization periods for intangible assets, and can materially affect the Companys results of operations. Transaction costs, as well as costs to reorganize acquired companies, are expensed as incurred in the Companys consolidated statements of income. In 2010, we acquired CCEs North American business and recorded total assets of approximately $22.2 billion as of the acquisition date. The assets we acquired included a material amount of intangible assets that are subject to the significant estimates described above. Our acquisition accounting is not complete and adjustments may be recorded in future periods as appraisals for intangible assets and certain fixed assets are completed. Refer to the heading "Recoverability of Noncurrent Assets," below, and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to this acquisition. Recoverability of Noncurrent Assets We perform recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. For certain assets, recoverability and or impairment tests are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For other assets, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently, if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. Our equity method investees also perform such recoverability and or impairment tests. If an impairment charge was recorded by one of our equity method investees, the Company would record its proportionate share of such charge as a reduction of equity income (loss) net in our consolidated income statements. However, the actual amount we record with respect to our proportionate share of such charges may be impacted by items such as basis differences, deferred taxes and deferred gains. 41 Managements assessments of the recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets involve critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management judgment, include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management must estimate include, among others, the economic life of the asset, sales volume, prices, inflation, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates and capital spending. These factors are even more difficult to predict when global financial markets are highly volatile. The estimates we use when assessing the recoverability of noncurrent assets are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. When performing impairment tests, we estimate the fair values of the assets using managements best assumptions, which we believe would be consistent with what a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. Estimates and assumptions used in these tests are evaluated and updated as appropriate. The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. If other assumptions and estimates had been used when these tests were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. As mentioned above, these factors do not change in isolation; and therefore, we do not believe it is practicable to present the impact of changing a single factor. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future periods, future impairment charges could result. Our Company faces many uncertainties and risks related to various economic, political and regulatory environments in the countries in which we operate, particularly in developing or emerging markets. Refer to the heading "Our Business Challenges and Risks," above, and "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in Part I of this report. As a result, management must make numerous assumptions which involve a significant amount of judgment when completing recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets in various regions around the world. Investments in Equity and Debt Securities The carrying values of our investments in equity securities are determined using the equity method, the cost method or the fair value method. Refer to the heading "Basis of Presentation," above, for information related to how the carrying values of our equity method investments are determined. We account for investments in companies that we do not control or account for under the equity method either at fair value or under the cost method, as applicable. Investments in equity securities are carried at fair value, if the fair value of the security is readily determinable. Equity investments carried at fair value are classified as either trading or available for sale securities. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities and realized gains and losses on available for sale securities are included in net income. Unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, on available for sale securities are included in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI"). Trading securities are reported as either marketable securities or other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Securities classified as available for sale are reported as either marketable securities or other investments in our consolidated balance sheets, depending on the length of time we intend to hold the investment. Investments in equity securities that do not qualify for fair value accounting are accounted for under the cost method. In accordance with the cost method, our initial investment is recorded at cost and we record dividend income when applicable dividends are declared. Cost method investments are reported as other investments in our consolidated balance sheets. Our investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. Investments in debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held to maturity. Investments in debt securities that are not classified as held to maturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available for sale. The following table presents the carrying values of our investments in equity and debt securities (in millions): December 31, 2010 Carrying Value Percentage of Total Assets Equity method investments $ 6,954 10 % Securities classified as available for sale 485 * Securities classified as trading 209 * Cost method investments 159 * Securities classified as held to maturity 111 * Total $ 7,918 11 % * Accounts for less than 1 percent of the Companys total assets. 42 Investments classified as trading securities are not assessed for impairment, since they are carried at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. We review our investments in equity and debt securities that are accounted for using the equity method or cost method or that are classified as available for sale or held to maturity each reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment. When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to our cost basis in the investment. We also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which our cost basis has exceeded the fair value in the prior period. The fair values of most of our Companys investments in publicly traded companies are often readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded companies, managements assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds and appraisals, as appropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or estimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in developing and emerging markets, may impact the determination of fair value. In the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. If management determines the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Managements assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is based on, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis, the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, and our intent and ability to retain the investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. As of December 31, 2010, unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities were approximately $267 million and $5 million, respectively. Management assessed each individual investment with unrealized losses to determine if the decline in fair value was other than temporary. Based on these assessments, management determined that the decline in fair value of each of these investments was temporary in nature. We will continue to monitor these investments in future periods. Refer to Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2010, the Company recognized other than temporary impairments of $41 million related to certain available for sale securities and an equity method investment. These impairment charges were recorded in other income (loss) net and impacted the Bottling Investments and Corporate operating segments. Refer to Note 16 and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2009, the Company recorded a charge of approximately $27 million in other income (loss) net as a result of an other than temporary decline in the fair value of a cost method investment. As of December 31, 2008, the estimated fair value of this investment approximated the Companys carrying value in the investment. However, in 2009, the Company was informed by the investee of its intent to reorganize its capital structure in 2009, which resulted in the Companys shares in the investee being canceled. As a result, the Company determined that the decline in fair value of this cost method investment was other than temporary. This impairment charge impacted the Corporate operating segment. Refer to Note 16 and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had several investments classified as available for sale securities in which our cost basis exceeded the fair value of the investment, each of which initially occurred between the end of the second quarter and the beginning of the third quarter of 2008. Management determined that the decline in fair value of each investment was other than temporary, and the Company recognized impairment charges of approximately $81 million during the fourth quarter of 2008. These impairment charges were recorded to other income (loss) net in the consolidated statement of income. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 43 The following table presents the difference between calculated fair values, based on quoted closing prices of publicly traded shares, and our Companys cost basis in publicly traded bottlers accounted for as equity method investments (in millions): December 31, 2010 Fair Value Carrying Value Difference Coca Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. $ 4,740 $ 1,315 $ 3,425 Coca Cola Amatil Limited 2,322 948 1,374 Coca Cola Hellenic Bottling Company S.A. 2,204 1,336 868 Coca Cola Icecek A.S. 692 183 509 Coca Cola Embonor S.A. 480 284 196 Grupo Continental, S.A.B. 439 175 264 Embotelladoras Coca Cola Polar S.A. 160 96 64 Coca Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated 138 83 55 $ 11,175 $ 4,420 $ 6,755 Other Assets Our Company invests in infrastructure programs with our bottlers that are directed at strengthening our bottling system and increasing unit case volume. Additionally, our Company advances payments to certain customers to fund future marketing activities intended to generate profitable volume and expenses such payments over the periods benefited. Advance payments are also made to certain customers for distribution rights. Payments under these programs are generally capitalized and reported in the line items prepaid expenses and other assets or other assets, as appropriate, in our consolidated balance sheets. When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. In 2010, as a result of our acquisition of CCEs North American business, the Company recorded a charge of $265 million related to preexisting relationships. The charge was primarily related to the write off of our investment in infrastructure programs with CCE. Our investment in these infrastructure programs with CCE did not meet the criteria to be recognized as an asset subsequent to the acquisition. Refer to Note 2 and Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Property, Plant and Equipment As of December 31, 2010, the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment, net of depreciation, was approximately $14,727 million, or 20 percent of our total assets. Certain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment should be assessed, including, among others, a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in the business climate in a particular market, or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses or projected future losses. When such events or changes in circumstances are present, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset (or asset group) and its eventual disposition. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of property, plant and equipment, including appraisals and discounted cash flow models, which are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use. 44  Goodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets Intangible assets are classified into one of three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill. For intangible assets with definite lives, tests for impairment must be performed if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill, tests for impairment must be performed at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. The following table presents the carrying values of intangible assets included in our consolidated balance sheet (in millions): December 31, 2010 Carrying Value Percentage of Total Assets Goodwill $ 11,665 16 % Bottlers franchise rights with indefinite lives 7,511 10 Trademarks with indefinite lives 6,356 9 Definite lived intangible assets, net 1,264 2 Other intangible assets not subject to amortization 113 * Total $ 26,909 37 % * Accounts for less than 1 percent of the Companys total assets. When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of definite lived intangible assets may not be recoverable, management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of these assets, including discounted cash flow models, which are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use. We test intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, including trademarks, franchise rights and goodwill, for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. Our Company performs these annual impairment reviews as of the first day of our third fiscal quarter. We use a variety of methodologies in conducting impairment assessments of indefinite lived intangible assets, including, but not limited to, discounted cash flow models, which are based on the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use. For indefinite lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segments. Our operating segments are primarily based on geographic responsibility, which is consistent with the way management runs our business. Our operating segments are subdivided into smaller geographic regions or territories that we sometimes refer to as business units. These business units are also our reporting units. The Bottling Investments operating segment includes all Company owned or consolidated bottling operations, regardless of geographic location, except for bottling operations managed by CCR, which are included in our North America operating segment. Generally, each Company owned or consolidated bottling operation within our Bottling Investments operating segment is its own reporting unit. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination. In 2010, the Company combined several reporting units within our Europe operating segment. In addition, we also combined several reporting units within our Pacific operating segment. These changes were the result of the Companys productivity initiatives. The goodwill impairment test consists of a two step process, if necessary. The first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. We typically use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. The assumptions used in these models are consistent with those we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the second step of the impairment test must be performed in order to determine the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the 45 carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. Intangible assets acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, primarily due to the fact that they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and macroeconomic conditions present at the time of acquisition. Consequently, if operating results and or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate shortly after an acquisition, it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets. A deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models, but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the estimated cost of capital and or discount rates. Additionally, as discussed above, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. As a result, the cost of capital and or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends, regardless of whether our Companys actual cost of capital has changed. Therefore, if the cost of capital and or discount rates change, our Company may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset or assets in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to, or greater than, our previously forecasted amounts. As of our most recent annual impairment review, the Company had no significant impairments of its intangible assets, individually or in the aggregate. In addition, as of December 31, 2010, we did not have any reporting units with a material amount of goodwill for which it is reasonably likely that they will fail step one of a goodwill impairment test in the near term. However, if macroeconomic conditions worsen, it is possible that we may experience significant impairments of some of our intangible assets, which would require us to recognize impairment charges. Management will continue to monitor the fair value of our intangible assets in future periods. In 2010, we acquired CCEs North American business, which resulted in the Company recording $13,878 million of intangible assets, including goodwill. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The acquired intangible assets included $5,705 million of bottler franchise rights, which consisted of $5,100 million of franchise rights with indefinite lives and $605 million of franchise rights with definite lives. The franchise rights with indefinite lives represent franchise rights that had previously provided CCE with exclusive and perpetual rights to manufacture and or distribute certain beverages in specified territories. The franchise rights with definite lives relate to franchise rights that had previously provided CCE with exclusive rights to manufacture and or distribute certain beverages in specified territories for a finite period of time and, therefore, have been classified as definite lived intangible assets. The bottler franchise rights acquired by the Company in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business include the contractual rights previously impaired by CCE. In 2008, CCE recorded pretax impairment charges of approximately $7.6 billion ($4.9 billion after tax), which reduced the carrying value of CCEs North American franchise rights to zero. The decline in the estimated fair value of CCEs North American franchise rights was the result of several factors including, but not limited to, (1) challenging macroeconomic conditions which contributed to lower than anticipated volume for higher margin packages and certain higher margin beverage categories; (2) increases in raw material costs including significant increases in aluminum, HFCS and resin; (3) increased delivery costs as a result of higher fuel costs; (4) a dramatic increase in market debt rates, which impacted the capital charge; and (5) a significant decline in the funded status of CCEs defined benefit pension plans. Similar factors may also potentially result in future impairments. In 2008, the Companys proportionate share of these impairment charges recorded by CCE was approximately $1.6 billion, which we recorded to equity income (loss) net. Refer to the heading "Operations Review Equity Income (Loss) Net" and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company recorded $7,746 million of goodwill in connection with this acquisition, which is not tax deductible and has been assigned to the North America operating segment. This goodwill is primarily related to synergistic value created from having a unified operating system that will strategically position us to better market and distribute our nonalcoholic beverage brands in North America. It also includes certain other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, such as an assembled workforce. In 2009, the Company recognized a $23 million impairment charge due to a change in the expected useful life of an intangible asset, which was previously determined to have an indefinite life. Refer to the heading "Operations Review Other Operating Charges," and Note 16 and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 46 Hyperinflationary Economies Our Company conducts business in more than 200 countries, some of which have been deemed to be hyperinflationary economies due to excessively high inflation rates in recent years. These economies create financial exposure to the Company. Venezuela was deemed to be a hyperinflationary economy subsequent to December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2009, two main exchange rate mechanisms existed in Venezuela. The first exchange rate mechanism is known as the official rate of exchange ("official rate"), which is set by the Venezuelan government. In order to utilize the official rate, entities must seek approval from the government operated Foreign Exchange Administration Board ("CADIVI"). As of December 31, 2009, the official rate set by the Venezuelan government was 2.15 bolivars per U.S. dollar. The second exchange rate mechanism was known as the parallel rate, which in some circumstances provided entities with a more liquid exchange through the use of a series of transactions via a broker. Subsequent to December 31, 2009, Venezuela was determined to be a hyperinflationary economy, and the Venezuelan government devalued the bolivar by resetting the official rate to 2.6 bolivars per U.S. dollar for essential goods and 4.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar for nonessential goods. In accordance with hyperinflationary accounting under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, our local subsidiary was required to use the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. As a result, we remeasured the net assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary using the official rate for nonessential goods of 4.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar. During the first quarter of 2010, we recorded a loss of approximately $103 million related to the remeasurement of our Venezuelan subsidiarys net assets. The loss was recorded in the line item other income (loss) net in our consolidated statement of income. We classified the impact of the remeasurement loss in the line item effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated statement of cash flows. In early June 2010, the Venezuelan government introduced a newly regulated foreign currency exchange system known as the Transaction System for Foreign Currency Denominated Securities ("SITME"). This new system, which is subject to annual limits, replaced the parallel market whereby entities domiciled in Venezuela are able to exchange their bolivar to U.S. dollars through authorized financial institutions (commercial banks, savings and lending institutions, etc.). In December 2010, the Venezuelan government announced that it was eliminating the official rate of 2.6 bolivars per U.S. dollar for essential goods. As a result, there are only two exchange rates available for remeasuring bolivar denominated transactions as of December 31, 2010, the official rate of 4.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar for nonessential goods and the SITME rate. As discussed above, the Company has remeasured the net assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary using the official rate for nonessential goods of 4.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar since January 1, 2010. Therefore, the elimination of the official rate for essential goods had no impact on the remeasurement of the net assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary. We continue to use the official exchange rate for nonessential goods to remeasure the financial statements of our Venezuelan subsidiary. If the official exchange rate devalues further, it would result in our Company recognizing additional foreign currency exchange losses in our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2010, our Venezuelan subsidiary held monetary assets of approximately $200 million. In addition to the foreign currency exchange exposure related to our Venezuelan subsidiarys net assets, we also sell concentrate to our bottling partner in Venezuela from outside the country. These sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Some of our concentrate sales were approved by the CADIVI to receive the official rate for essential goods of 2.6 bolivars per U.S. dollar prior to the elimination of the official rate for essential goods in December 2010. Prior to the elimination of the official rate for essential goods, our bottling partner in Venezuela was able to convert bolivars to U.S. dollars to settle our receivables related to sales approved by the CADIVI. Therefore, as of December 31, 2010, our receivable balance related to concentrate sales that had been approved by the CADIVI was not significant. If we are unable to utilize a government approved exchange rate mechanism for future concentrate sales to our bottling partner in Venezuela, the amount of receivables related to these sales will increase. In addition, we have certain intangible assets associated with products sold in Venezuela. If we are unable to utilize a government approved exchange rate mechanism for concentrate sales, or if the bolivar further devalues, it could result in the impairment of these intangible assets. As of December 31, 2010, the carrying value of our accounts receivable from our bottling partner in Venezuela and intangible assets associated with products sold in Venezuela was approximately $135 million. The revenues and cash flows associated with concentrate sales to our bottling partner in Venezuela in 2011 are not anticipated to be significant to the Companys consolidated financial statements. 47 Pension Plan Valuations Our Company sponsors and or contributes to pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans covering substantially all U.S. employees. We also sponsor nonqualified, unfunded defined benefit pension plans for certain associates and participate in multi employer pension plans in the United States. In addition, our Company and its subsidiaries have various pension plans and other forms of postretirement arrangements outside the United States. Management is required to make certain critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions used to determine our pension expense and related obligation. We believe the most critical assumptions are related to (1) the discount rate used to determine the present value of the liabilities and (2) the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. All of our actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually. Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension expense and related obligation. At each measurement date, we determine the discount rate by reference to rates of high quality, long term corporate bonds that mature in a pattern similar to the future payments we anticipate making under the plans. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the weighted average discount rate used to compute our benefit obligation was 5.5 percent and 5.75 percent, respectively. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based upon the long term outlook of our investment strategy as well as our historical returns and volatilities for each asset class. We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of our long term rates. Our pension plan investment objective is to ensure all our plans have sufficient funds to meet their benefit obligations when they become due. As a result, the Company periodically revises asset allocations, where appropriate, to improve returns and manage risk. The weighted average expected long term rate of return used to calculate our net periodic benefit cost was 8.0 percent in both 2010 and 2009. In 2010, the Companys total pension expense was $176 million. In 2011, we expect our total pension expense to be approximately $240 million. The expected increase is primarily due to the impact of our acquisition of CCEs North American business. The estimated impact of an additional 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate on our 2011 pension expense is an increase to our pension expense of approximately $21 million. Additionally, the estimated impact of a 50 basis point decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets on our 2011 pension expense is an increase to our pension expense of approximately $20 million. The sensitivity information provided above is based only on changes to the actuarial assumptions used for our U.S. pension plans. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our pension plans and related actuarial assumptions. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of products has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. For our Company, this generally means that we recognize revenue when title to our products is transferred to our bottling partners, resellers or other customers. Title usually transfers upon shipment to or receipt at our customers locations, as determined by the specific sales terms of each transaction. Our sales terms do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing defects on our part. Our customers can earn certain incentives, which are included in deductions from revenue, a component of net operating revenues in the consolidated statements of income. These incentives include, but are not limited to, cash discounts, funds for promotional and marketing activities, volume based incentive programs and support for infrastructure programs. Refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The aggregate deductions from revenue recorded by the Company in relation to these programs, including amortization expense on infrastructure programs, were approximately $5.0 billion, $4.5 billion and $4.4 billion in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In preparing the financial statements, management must make estimates related to the contractual terms, customer performance and sales volume to determine the total amounts recorded as deductions from revenue. Management also considers past results in making such estimates. The actual amounts ultimately paid may be different from our estimates. Such differences are recorded once they have been determined, and have historically not been significant. 48  Income Taxes Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain based upon one of the following: (1) the tax position is not "more likely than not" to be sustained, (2) the tax position is "more likely than not" to be sustained, but for a lesser amount, or (3) the tax position is "more likely than not" to be sustained, but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken. For purposes of evaluating whether or not a tax position is uncertain, (1) we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information, (2) the technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position, and (3) each tax position is evaluated without considerations of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax positions taken. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the "more likely than not" recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is "more likely than not" to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. Tax law requires items to be included in the tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements. As a result, the annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our tax return (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. The tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year and manner in which the differences are expected to reverse. Based on the evaluation of all available information, the Company recognizes future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not. We evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results, the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, taxable income in prior carryback years (if permitted) and the availability of tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is required to be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that the Company will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset. As of December 31, 2010, the Companys valuation allowances on deferred tax assets were $950 million and are primarily related to uncertainties regarding the future realization of recorded tax benefits on tax loss carryforwards generated in various jurisdictions. Current evidence does not suggest we will realize sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (e.g., capital gain versus ordinary income) within the carryforward period to allow us to realize these deferred tax benefits. If we were to identify and implement tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or generate sufficient income of the appropriate character in these jurisdictions in the future, it could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense. The Company believes that it will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets. The Company does not record a U.S. deferred tax liability for the excess of the book basis over the tax basis of its investments in foreign corporations to the extent that the basis difference results from earnings that meet the indefinite reversal criteria. This criteria is met if the foreign subsidiary has invested, or will invest, the undistributed earnings indefinitely. The decision as to the amount of undistributed earnings that the Company intends to maintain in non U.S. subsidiaries takes into account items including, but is not limited to, forecasts and budgets of financial needs of cash for working capital, liquidity plans, capital improvement programs, merger and acquisition plans, and planned loans to other non U.S. subsidiaries. The Company also evaluates its expected cash requirements in the United States. Other 49 factors that can influence that determination are local restrictions on remittances (for example, in some countries a central bank application and approval are required in order for the Companys local country subsidiary to pay a dividend), economic stability, and asset risk. As of December 31, 2010, undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries that met the indefinite reversal criteria amounted to $20.8 billion. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Companys effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23.5 percent to 24.5 percent in 2011. This estimated tax rate does not reflect the impact of any unusual or special items that may affect our tax rate in 2011. Contingencies Our Company is subject to various claims and contingencies, mostly related to legal proceedings and tax matters (both income taxes and indirect taxes). Due to their nature, such legal proceedings and tax matters involve inherent uncertainties including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties and governmental actions. Management assesses the probability of loss for such contingencies and accrues a liability and or discloses the relevant circumstances, as appropriate. Management believes that any liability to the Company that may arise as a result of currently pending legal proceedings, tax matters or other contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company taken as a whole. Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Standards and Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting standards and pronouncements. Operations Review Our organizational structure as of December 31, 2010, consisted of the following operating segments, the first six of which are sometimes referred to as "operating groups" or "groups": Eurasia and Africa; Europe; Latin America; North America; Pacific; Bottling Investments; and Corporate. For further information regarding our operating segments, refer to Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements In order to continually improve upon the Companys operating performance, from time to time, we engage in buying and selling ownership interests in bottling partners and other manufacturing operations. In addition, we also acquire brands or enter into license agreements for certain brands to supplement our beverage offerings. These items impact our operating results and certain key metrics used by management in assessing the Companys performance. Unit case volume growth is a key metric used by management to evaluate the Companys performance because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. The Companys unit case volume represents the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers and, therefore, reflects unit case volume for consolidated and unconsolidated bottlers. Refer to the heading "Beverage Volume," below. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates and syrups (in all cases expressed in equivalent unit cases) sold by, or used in finished products sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. Refer to the heading "Beverage Volume," below. Our Bottling Investments segment and our other finished products operations, including those managed by CCR, typically generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling beverages and a variety of still beverages, such as juices and juice drinks, energy and sports drinks, ready to drink teas and coffees, and certain water products, to retailers or to distributors, wholesalers and bottling partners who distribute them to retailers. In addition, in the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers such as restaurants and convenience stores who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. For these finished products operations, we recognize the associated concentrate sales volume at the time the unit case or unit case equivalent is sold to the customer. Our concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to authorized bottling and canning operations. For these concentrate operations, we recognize concentrate revenue and concentrate 50 sales volume when we sell concentrate to the authorized unconsolidated bottling and canning operations and we typically report unit case volume when finished products manufactured from the concentrates and syrups are sold to the customer. When we analyze our net operating revenues we generally consider the following four factors: (1) volume growth (unit case volume or concentrate sales volume, as appropriate), (2) structural changes, (3) changes in price, product and geographic mix and (4) foreign currency fluctuations. Refer to the heading "Net Operating Revenues," below. "Structural changes" generally refers to acquisitions or dispositions of bottling, distribution or canning operations and consolidation or deconsolidation of bottling and distribution entities for accounting purposes. Typically, structural changes do not impact the Companys unit case volume on a consolidated basis or at the geographic operating segment level. We recognize unit case volume for all sales of Company beverage products regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any. However, our Bottling Investments operating segment is generally impacted by structural changes because it only includes the unit case volume of consolidated bottlers. The Company sells concentrates and syrups to both consolidated and unconsolidated bottling partners. The ownership structure of our bottling partners impacts the timing of recognizing concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our consolidated bottling partners, we are not able to recognize the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume until the bottling partner has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a customer. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our unconsolidated bottling partners, we recognize the concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume when the concentrates or syrups are sold to the bottling partner. The subsequent sale of the finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a customer does not impact the timing of recognizing the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume. "Acquired brands" refers to brands acquired during the current year. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to acquired brands in periods prior to the closing of the transaction. Therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume from the sale of these brands is incremental to prior year volume. We do not generally consider acquired brands to be structural changes. "License agreements" refers to brands not owned by the Company, but for which we hold certain rights, generally including, but not limited to, distribution rights, and we derive an economic benefit from the ultimate sale of these brands. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to these brands in periods prior to the beginning of the term of the license agreement. Therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume from the sale of these brands is incremental to prior year volume. We do not generally consider new license agreements to be structural changes. The following significant transactions and agreements impacted the Companys 2010 operating results: on October 2, 2010, in legally separate transactions, we acquired CCEs North American business and entered into a license agreement with DPS; on October 2, 2010, we sold all of our ownership interests in our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE; and on January 1, 2010, we deconsolidated certain entities, primarily bottling operations, as a result of the Companys adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. The impact that each of the aforementioned items had on the Companys consolidated financial statements is discussed throughout this report, as appropriate. The sections below are intended to provide an overview of the impact these items had on our 2010 operating results and are expected to have on key metrics used by management. Acquisition of CCEs North American Business and the DPS License Agreements Immediately prior to the October 2, 2010 completion of our acquisition of CCEs North American business, the Company owned 33 percent of CCEs outstanding common stock. This ownership represented our indirect ownership interest in both CCEs North American business and its European operations. On October 2, 2010, the Company acquired the remaining 67 percent of CCEs North American business not already owned by the Company for consideration that included the Companys indirect ownership interest in CCEs European operations. As a result of this transaction, the Company now owns 100 percent of CCEs North American business and does not own any interest in New CCEs European operations. Refer to the heading "Our Business General," above, and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the acquisition. 51  The operating results of CCEs North American business are included in our consolidated financial statements effective October 2, 2010. The operating results of New CCE had no direct impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements, since we have no ownership interest in this entity. CCEs North American business contributed net revenues of approximately $3,637 million and net losses of approximately $122 million from October 2, 2010 through December 31, 2010. Furthermore, the Company recorded total assets as a result of the acquisition of $22.2 billion. Refer to the heading "Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position," below, for additional information related to the impact the acquisition had on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. On October 2, 2010, the Company also entered into an agreement with DPS to distribute certain DPS brands in territories where these brands were distributed by CCE prior to our acquisition of CCEs North American business. The license agreements replaced agreements between DPS and CCE existing immediately prior to the completion of our acquisition of CCEs North American business. Refer to the heading "Our Business General," above, and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to these new license agreements. Prior to the acquisition of CCEs North American business and entering into the DPS license agreements, the Companys North America operating segment was predominantly a concentrate operation. As a result of the acquisition of CCEs North American business and the DPS license agreements, the North America operating segment is now predominantly a finished products operation. Generally, finished products operations produce higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins and operating margins compared to concentrate operations. Refer to "Item 1. Business Products and Brands," for additional discussion of the differences between the Companys concentrate operations and our finished products operations. These transactions resulted in higher net operating revenues, but lower gross profit margins and operating margins for the North America operating segment and our consolidated operating results. Prior to the acquisition of CCEs North American business, the Company reported unit case volume for the sale of Company beverage products sold by CCE. After the transaction closing, we reported unit case volume of Company beverage products just as we had prior to the transaction. Prior to the acquisition of CCEs North American business, the Company recognized concentrate sales volume at the time we sold the concentrate to CCE. Upon the closing of the transaction, we do not recognize the concentrate sales volume until CCR has sold finished products manufactured from concentrate to a customer. The DPS license agreements impact both the Companys unit case and concentrate sales volume. Sales made pursuant to these license agreements represent acquired volume and are incremental unit case volume and concentrate sales volume to the Company. Prior to entering into the license agreements, the Company did not include the DPS brands as unit case volume or concentrate sales volume, as these brands were not Company beverage products. As mentioned above, we do not normally consider new license agreements to be structural changes. However, in the case of the DPS license agreements, given their correlation to our acquisition of CCEs North American business, we have included the impact of these license agreements as a structural change when explaining our 2010 financial results. Since we have determined it is appropriate to include the impact of the DPS license agreements as a structural change, the total revenues attributable to CCEs North American business, including DPS, recognized by the Company since the date of acquisition are considered a structural change. Prior to the acquisition, we recognized the revenues and profits associated with concentrate sales when the concentrate was sold to CCE, excluding the portion that was deemed to be intercompany due to our previous ownership interest in CCE. However, subsequent to the acquisition, the Company will not recognize the revenues and profits associated with concentrate sold to CCEs North American business until the finished products manufactured from those concentrates are sold. For example, in 2010, most of our pre Easter concentrate sales to CCE impacted our first quarter operating results. In 2011, we anticipate that most of our Easter related finished product sales will likely impact our second quarter operating results. Likewise, in 2010, most of our pre July 4th concentrate sales to CCE impacted our second quarter operating results. In 2011, the impact of the July 4th holiday related finished product sales will likely impact our third quarter operating results. As a result of this transaction, the Company does not have an indirect ownership interest in New CCEs European operations. Therefore, we are no longer required to defer the portion of revenues and profits associated with concentrate sales to New CCE. 52 In 2010, the gross profit for our North America operating segment was negatively impacted by $235 million, primarily due to the elimination of gross profit in inventory on intercompany sales and an inventory fair value adjustment as a result of the acquisition. Refer to the headings "Gross Profit Margin" and "Operating Income and Operating Margin." The acquisition of CCEs North American business has resulted in a significant adjustment to our overall cost structure, especially in North America. We estimate that approximately 35 percent of our total cost of goods in 2011 will be comprised of both the raw material and conversion costs associated with the following inputs: (1) sweeteners, (2) metals, (3) juices and (4) PET. The bulk of these costs will reside within our North America and Bottling Investments operating segments. We anticipate the underlying commodities related to these inputs will continue to face upward pressure; and therefore, we have increased our hedging activities related to certain commodities in order to mitigate a portion of the price risk associated with forecasted purchases. Many of the derivative financial instruments used by the Company to mitigate the risk associated with these commodity exposures do not qualify for hedge accounting. As a result, the change in fair value of these derivative instruments will be included as a component of net income each reporting period. Refer to the heading "Gross Profit Margin," below, and Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our commodity hedging activity. The acquisition of CCEs North American business increased the Companys selling, general and administrative expenses in 2010, primarily due to delivery related expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses are typically higher, as a percentage of net operating revenues, for finished products operations compared to concentrate operations. Selling, general and administrative expenses were also negatively impacted by the amortization of definite lived intangible assets acquired in the acquisition. The Company recorded $605 million of definite lived acquired franchise rights that are being amortized over a weighted average life of approximately 8 years, which is equal to the weighted average remaining contractual term of the acquired franchise rights. In addition, the Company recorded $380 million of customer rights that are being amortized over 20 years. We estimate the amortization expense related to these definite lived intangible assets to be approximately $100 million per year for the next several years, which will be recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Once fully integrated, we expect to generate operational synergies of at least $350 million per year. We anticipate realizing approximately $140 million to $150 million of these synergies in 2011. Refer to the heading "Other Operating Charges," below, and Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding this integration initiative. In connection with the Companys acquisition of CCEs North American business, we assumed $7,602 million of long term debt, which had an estimated fair value of $9,345 million as of the acquisition date. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we recorded the assumed debt at its fair value as of the acquisition date. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. On November 15, 2010, the Company issued $4,500 million of long term notes and used some of the proceeds to repurchase $2,910 million of long term debt. The Company used the remaining cash from the issuance to reduce our outstanding commercial paper balance. The repurchased debt consisted of $1,827 million of debt assumed in our acquisition of CCEs North American business and $1,083 million of the Companys debt that was outstanding prior to the acquisition. The Company recorded a charge of $342 million related to the premiums paid to repurchase the long term debt and the costs associated with the settlement of treasury rate locks issued in connection with the debt tender offer. Refer to the heading "Interest Expense," below, and Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In 2010, we recognized a gain of $4,978 million due to the remeasurement of our equity interest in CCE to fair value upon the close of the transaction. This gain was classified in the line item other income (loss) net in our consolidated statement of income. Although our 2010 operating results and certain key metrics were affected by these structural changes, we do not believe it is indicative of the impact they will have on future operating periods. Our 2011 consolidated financial statements will reflect twelve months of operating results of the acquired CCE North American business and DPS license agreements compared to three months in 2010. Therefore, we expect these structural changes to have a significant impact on our operating results and certain key metrics in 2011, when compared to 2010. Prior to the closing of this acquisition, we had accounted for our investment in CCE under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, we recorded our proportionate share of CCEs net income or loss 53 in the line item equity income (loss) net in our consolidated statements of income. However, as a result of this transaction, beginning October 2, 2010, the Company no longer records equity income or loss related to CCE; and therefore, we expect this transaction to negatively impact equity income in future periods. Refer to the heading "Equity Income (Loss) Net," below. Divestiture of Norwegian and Swedish Bottling Operations The divestiture of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations had no impact on our consolidated unit case volume and consolidated concentrate sales volume, for the same reasons discussed above in relation to our acquisition of CCEs North American business. The divestiture of these bottling operations reduced unit case volume for the Bottling Investments operating segment. In addition, the divestiture reduced net operating revenues and net income for our consolidated operating results and the Bottling Investments operating segment. However, since we divested a finished goods business, it had a positive impact on our gross profit margins and operating margins. Furthermore, the impact these divestitures had on the Companys net operating revenues was partially offset by the concentrate revenues that were recognized on sales to these bottling operations. These concentrate sales had previously been eliminated because they were intercompany transactions. The net impact to net operating revenues was included as a structural change in our analysis of changes to net operating revenues. Refer to the heading "Net Operating Revenues," below. This divestiture resulted in a gain of $597 million, which was classified in the line item other income (loss) net in our consolidated statement of income. Impact of New Accounting Guidance Beginning January 1, 2010, we deconsolidated certain entities as a result of the Companys adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. These entities are primarily bottling operations and have been accounted for under the equity method of accounting since they were deconsolidated. Refer to the heading "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Principles of Consolidation," above. The entities that have been deconsolidated as a result of this change in accounting guidance accounted for approximately 3 percent of the Companys consolidated net operating revenues and less than 1 percent of net income attributable to shareowners of The Coca Cola Company in 2009. Refer to the heading "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Principles of Consolidation," above. These entities accounted for approximately 4 percent of the Companys equity income in 2010. Refer to the heading "Equity Income (Loss) Net," below. The impact that the deconsolidation of these entities had on net operating revenues was included as a structural change. Refer to the heading "Net Operating Revenues," below. Beverage Volume We measure the volume of Company beverage products sold in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and (2) concentrate sales. As used in this report, "unit case" means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight ounce servings); and "unit case volume" means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers. Unit case volume primarily consists of beverage products bearing Company trademarks. Also included in unit case volume are certain products licensed to, or distributed by, our Company, and brands owned by Coca Cola system bottlers for which our Company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive economic benefit. In addition, unit case volume includes sales by joint ventures in which the Company has an equity interest. We believe unit case volume is one of the measures of the underlying strength of the Coca Cola system because it measures trends at the consumer level. The unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the Company from its bottling partners and distributors. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates and syrups (in all cases expressed in equivalent unit cases) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. Unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period. Factors such as seasonality, bottlers inventory practices, supply point changes, timing of price increases, new product introductions and changes in product mix can impact unit case volume and concentrate sales volume and can create differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. In addition to the items mentioned above, the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures, in which the Company has an equity interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates or syrups, may give rise to differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. 54 Information about our volume growth by operating segment is as follows: Percent Change 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Year Ended December 31, Unit Cases 1,2 Concentrate Sales Unit Cases 1,2 Concentrate Sales Worldwide 5 % 5 % 3 % 3 % Eurasia & Africa 12 % 12 % 4 % 5 % Europe (1 ) (2 ) Latin America 5 7 6 7 North America 2 2 (2 ) (2 ) Pacific 6 6 7 7 Bottling Investments (1 ) N/A 2 N/A 1 Bottling Investments operating segment data reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only. 2 Geographic segment data reflects unit case volume growth for all bottlers in the applicable geographic areas, both consolidated and unconsolidated. Unit Case Volume The Coca Cola system sold approximately 25.5 billion unit cases of our products in 2010, approximately 24.4 billion unit cases in 2009 and approximately 23.7 billion unit cases in 2008. Year Ended December 31, 2010, versus Year Ended December 31, 2009 In Eurasia and Africa, unit case volume increased 12 percent, which consisted of 10 percent growth in sparkling beverages and 21 percent growth in still beverages. The groups unit case volume growth was primarily attributable to 17 percent growth in India, which included growth of 15 percent and 23 percent in sparkling and still beverages, respectively. Indias growth in sparkling beverages was led by double digit growth in Trademarks Sprite, Thums Up and Coca Cola, which reflected the benefit of successful national marketing programs. Still beverage growth in India included the impact of 22 percent growth in our Maaza juice brand. In addition to growth in India, the groups unit case volume growth included 14 percent growth in Turkey, 8 percent growth in North and West Africa, 16 percent growth in Russia, 20 percent growth in Southern Eurasia, 12 percent growth in East and Central Africa and 5 percent growth in South Africa. The growth across the African continent was attributable to the strong performance of both sparkling and still beverages and the benefit of our FIFA World Cup activation programs. Unit case volume in Europe was even, which reflected the impact of continuing difficult macroeconomic conditions throughout certain regions in Europe. The groups unit case volume included unit case volume growth of 5 percent in France, 1 percent in Germany and 2 percent in our Nordic Business Unit. The growth in these regions was offset by unit case volume declines in other regions, including a 7 percent decline in South and Eastern Europe, primarily due to continuing macroeconomic pressures. The groups unit case volume also included unit case volume declines of 2 percent and 1 percent in Italy and Iberia, respectively. In Latin America, unit case volume increased 5 percent, which consisted of 4 percent growth in sparkling beverages and 9 percent growth in still beverages. The groups unit case volume growth was led by 11 percent growth in Brazil and 3 percent growth in Mexico. Brazils unit case volume growth was primarily due to 11 percent growth in sparkling beverages, led by 11 percent growth in Trademark Coca Cola. Mexicos unit case volume growth was impacted by adverse weather conditions. The groups unit case volume growth also included 5 percent growth in our South Latin Business Unit. All of the aforementioned markets benefited from our strong FIFA World Cup activation programs. Unit case volume in North America increased 2 percent, including 1 percent attributable to the new license agreements with DPS. The groups unit case volume growth was driven by 5 percent growth in still beverages, led by 19 percent growth in Trademark Powerade, 12 percent growth in teas and 23 percent growth in Trademark Simply. Unit case volume for sparkling beverages in North America increased 1 percent, primarily due to the sale of DPS brands under the new license agreements. Coca Cola Zero continued its strong performance in North America with 15 percent 55 growth in 2010. The groups strong marketing initiatives, including our FIFA World Cup activation programs, contributed to the unit case volume growth in North America. The volume and net operating revenues attributable to the sale of DPS brands have been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues. Refer to the heading "Net Operating Revenues," below, and "Structural Changes and New License Agreements," above. In Pacific, unit case volume increased 6 percent, which consisted of 13 percent growth in still beverages and 2 percent growth in sparkling beverages. The groups volume growth was led by 6 percent growth in China, 15 percent growth in the Philippines and 3 percent growth in Japan. Chinas volume growth included 21 percent growth in juices and juice drinks primarily due to the continued strong momentum of Minute Maid Pulpy, as well as strong growth in other still beverages including water. Tough weather conditions, including flooding in the higher per capita consumption regions, negatively impacted unit case volume in China. In the Philippines, unit case volume growth was led by 14 percent growth in Trademark Coca Cola. In Japan, the unit case volume growth was driven by successful in market activations, strong innovation and favorable weather conditions. Included in Japans unit case volume growth was 5 percent growth in Trademark Coca Cola, primarily due to strong FIFA World Cup activation programs and our Coca Cola Summer Promotion. Japans unit case volume growth also benefited from 17 percent growth in sports drinks. Unit case volume for Bottling Investments decreased 1 percent, primarily due to the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of the Companys adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. These entities are primarily bottling operations and have been accounted for under the equity method of accounting since they were deconsolidated on January 1, 2010. Refer to the heading "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Principles of Consolidation" and "Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements." The deconsolidation of these entities negatively impacted the unit case volume for Bottling Investments by approximately 9 percent. Unit case volume for Bottling Investments was also negatively impacted by the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE. The unfavorable impact of the aforementioned items was partially offset by growth in markets where we own or otherwise consolidate the bottling operations. Unit case volume grew 6 percent in China, 17 percent in India, 15 percent in the Philippines and 1 percent in Germany. The Companys consolidated bottling operations account for approximately 33 percent, 66 percent, 100 percent and 100 percent of the unit case volume in China, India, the Philippines and Germany, respectively. Year Ended December 31, 2009, versus Year Ended December 31, 2008 In Eurasia and Africa, unit case volume increased 4 percent, which consisted of 3 percent growth in sparkling beverages and 8 percent growth in still beverages. The groups unit case volume growth was primarily attributable to 31 percent growth in India, led by 32 percent growth in sparkling beverages. The sparkling beverages growth in India was largely due to double digit growth in Trademarks Thums Up, Sprite, Fanta and Coca Cola. Still beverages in India grew 28 percent, driven by double digit growth in Trademark Maaza. The group also benefited from 6 percent volume growth in North and West Africa and 10 percent volume growth in East and Central Africa. The groups unit case volume growth also included the impact of a 14 percent volume decline in Russia, primarily due to a challenging economic environment. In addition, South Africa and Turkey each experienced a 1 percent unit case volume decline. Unit case volume in Europe decreased 1 percent, primarily attributable to difficult macroeconomic conditions throughout most of Europe. These difficult macroeconomic conditions impacted a number of key markets and contributed to unit case volume declines of 8 percent in South and Eastern Europe, 4 percent in Iberia and 2 percent in Germany. The volume declines in these markets were partially offset by 6 percent unit case volume growth in France and 4 percent growth in Great Britain. The unit case volume growth in both France and Great Britain was led by Trademark Coca Cola. In Latin America, unit case volume increased 6 percent, which consisted of 3 percent growth in sparkling beverages and 24 percent growth in still beverages. The group benefited from strong volume growth in key markets, including 6 percent in Mexico, 4 percent in Brazil, 2 percent in Argentina and double digit growth in Colombia. Acquisitions contributed 1 percentage point of the groups total unit case volume growth. The groups sparkling beverage volume growth was primarily attributable to 4 percent growth in brand Coca Cola. The successful integration of Jugos del Valle, S.A.B. de C.V. ("Jugos del Valle") drove still beverage volume growth. 56 Unit case volume in North America decreased 2 percent, which reflected the impact of a difficult U.S. economic environment and a competitive pricing environment. The effect of the economic environment and pricing environment was partially offset by the impact of strong customer and consumer programs. North Americas unit case volume decline consisted of a 3 percent decline in sparkling beverages, partially offset by 1 percent growth in still beverages. The decline in sparkling beverages was partly attributable to the significant price increase taken by bottlers in the fourth quarter of 2008. The decline was partially offset by the continued strong performance of Coca Cola Zero, which had unit case volume growth of 19 percent. Still beverage unit case volume growth was primarily due to the strong performance of Fuze Beverage, LLC ("Fuze"), Trademark Simply and tea. The unit case volume growth in still beverages was reduced by a double digit volume decline in the North American water businesses, including Trademark Dasani, primarily due to the slowing water category and the Companys decision to not pursue unprofitable volume opportunities in bulk water/case packs in North America. In Pacific, unit case volume increased 7 percent, which consisted of growth in sparkling and still beverages of 6 percent and 8 percent, respectively. Sparkling beverage growth in Pacific included 14 percent growth in Trademark Sprite and 5 percent growth in Trademark Coca Cola. The groups volume growth was led by 16 percent growth in China, which reflected 11 percent growth in sparkling beverages and 30 percent growth in still beverages. Chinas sparkling beverage volume growth was led by double digit growth in Trademark Sprite and 6 percent growth in Trademark Coca Cola. Chinas still beverage volume growth was led by double digit growth in Minute Maid. The unit case volume growth in China was partially offset by a 2 percent volume decline in Japan, primarily due to the continued severe economic challenges and unfavorable weather conditions during what are traditionally high volume months. Sparkling beverage volume in Japan was even, while still beverages declined 3 percent. The decline in still beverages included the impact of a 5 percent volume decline in Aquarius and a 3 percent decline in Georgia Coffee. Due to the weak economy, Georgia Coffee was negatively impacted by shifts away from the at work vending channel. The groups volume increase also included a 1 percent increase in the Philippines. Unit case volume for Bottling Investments increased 2 percent, primarily due to the impact of unit case volume growth of 16 percent in China, 31 percent in India and 1 percent in the Philippines. The Companys consolidated bottling operations account for approximately 33 percent, 65 percent and 100 percent of the unit case volume in China, India and the Philippines, respectively. The favorable impact of unit case volume in these markets was partially offset by the sale of certain bottling operations during 2008, including Refrigerantes Minas Gerais Ltda. ("Remil"), a bottler in Brazil, and the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in Coca Cola Beverages Pakistan Ltd. ("Coca Cola Pakistan"), which resulted in its deconsolidation. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, Germanys unit case volume declined 2 percent. The Companys consolidated bottling operations account for 100 percent of the unit case volume in Germany. Concentrate Sales Volume In 2010, concentrate sales volume and unit case volume both grew 5 percent compared to 2009. In 2009, concentrate sales volume and unit case volume both grew 3 percent compared to 2008. The differences between concentrate sales volume and unit case volume growth rates for individual operating segments in 2010 and 2009 were primarily due to the timing of concentrate shipments and the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the Company has an equity interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates, syrups, beverage bases or powders. 57 Analysis of Consolidated Statements of Income Percent Change Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 (In millions except percentages and per share data) NET OPERATING REVENUES $ 35,119 $ 30,990 $ 31,944 13 % (3 )% Cost of goods sold 12,693 11,088 11,374 14 (3 ) GROSS PROFIT 22,426 19,902 20,570 13 (3 ) GROSS PROFIT MARGIN 63.9 % 64.2 % 64.4 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 13,158 11,358 11,774 16 (4 ) Other operating charges 819 313 350 * * OPERATING INCOME 8,449 8,231 8,446 3 (3 ) OPERATING MARGIN 24.1 % 26.6 % 26.4 % Interest income 317 249 333 27 (25 ) Interest expense 733 355 438 106 (19 ) Equity income (loss) net 1,025 781 (874 ) 31 * Other income (loss) net 5,185 40 39 * * INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 14,243 8,946 7,506 59 19 Income taxes 2,384 2,040 1,632 17 25 Effective tax rate 16.7 % 22.8 % 21.7 % CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME 11,859 6,906 5,874 72 18 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 50 82 67 (39 ) 22 NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO SHAREOWNERS OF THE COCA COLA COMPANY $ 11,809 $ 6,824 $ 5,807 73 % 18 % NET INCOME PER SHARE1 Basic net income per share $ 5.12 $ 2.95 $ 2.51 74 % 18 % Diluted net income per share $ 5.06 $ 2.93 $ 2.49 73 % 18 % * Calculation is not meaningful. 1 Basic net income per share and diluted net income per share are calculated based on net income attributable to shareowners of The Coca Cola Company. 58 Net Operating Revenues Year Ended December 31, 2010, versus Year Ended December 31, 2009 Net operating revenues increased by $4,129 million, or 13 percent.

Refer to the heading "Beverage Volume," above, for additional information related to changes in our unit case and concentrate sales volume. Refer to the heading "Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements," above, for additional information related to significant structural changes. Price, product and geographic mix had a favorable 1 percent impact on consolidated net operating revenues. Price, product and geographic mix for our operating segments was impacted by a variety of factors and events including, but not limited to, the following: consolidated results were unfavorably impacted by geographic mix as a result of growth in our emerging and developing markets. The growth in our emerging and developing markets resulted in unfavorable geographic mix due to the fact that the revenue per unit sold in these markets is generally less than in developed markets; Eurasia and Africa was negatively impacted by unfavorable geographic mix due to the growth in emerging and developing markets such as India and Russia. The revenue per unit sold in these markets is generally less than in developed markets; Latin America was favorably impacted by pricing in a number of our key markets and the impact of still beverages growing faster than sparkling beverages; Pacific was negatively impacted by unfavorable geographic mix due to the growth in emerging and developing markets such as China and the Philippines. The revenue per unit sold in these markets is generally less than in developed markets. 59  The favorable impact of currency fluctuations increased net operating revenues by approximately 2 percent. The favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was primarily due to a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Brazilian real, South African rand and Australian dollar, which had a favorable impact on the Eurasia and Africa, Latin America, Pacific and Bottling Investments operating segments. The favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to the aforementioned currencies was partially offset by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the euro and British pound, which had an unfavorable impact on the Europe and Bottling Investments operating segments. Refer to the heading "Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position Foreign Exchange." Year Ended December 31, 2009, versus Year Ended December 31, 2008 Net operating revenues decreased by $954 million, or 3 percent.

Our Bottling Investments operating segment data reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only. Refer to the heading "Beverage Volume," above. Refer to the heading "Beverage Volume," above, for additional information related to changes in our unit case and concentrate sales volume. Structural changes accounted for approximately 1 percent of the decrease in net operating revenues. This decrease was primarily attributable to the sale of certain bottling operations during 2008, including Remil and a portion of our ownership interest in Coca Cola Pakistan, which resulted in its deconsolidation. Refer to the heading "Operations Review Other Income (Loss) Net" and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Price, product and geographic mix had a net zero percent impact on consolidated net operating revenues. Price, product and geographic mix for our operating segments was impacted by a variety of factors and events including, but not limited to, the following: consolidated results were unfavorably impacted by shifts in our marketing and media spend strategies. The shift in our marketing and media spend strategies was primarily due to spending more marketing dollars toward in store activations, loyalty points programs and point of sale marketing. Many of these strategies impact net revenues instead of marketing expenses. Refer to the heading "Selling, General and Administrative Expenses," below; consolidated results were unfavorably impacted by geographic mix as a result of growth in our emerging and developing markets. The growth in our emerging and developing markets resulted in unfavorable geographic mix due to the fact that the revenue per unit sold in these markets is generally less than in developed markets; Latin America benefited from the successful integration of Jugos del Valle. Refer to the heading "Beverage Volume," above; 60 North America was favorably impacted by the growth of our still beverage volume, primarily due to the strong performance of Fuze, Trademark Simply and tea. Refer to the heading "Beverage Volume," above; Pacific was negatively impacted by unfavorable geographic mix due to the growth in emerging and developing markets such as China and a decline in Japan, a developed market. Refer to the heading "Beverage Volume," above. The revenue per unit sold in emerging and developing markets is generally less than in developed markets. The Pacific operating segment was also unfavorably impacted by shifts away from the at work vending channel in our Japanese business. The unfavorable impact of currency fluctuations decreased net operating revenues by approximately 5 percent. The unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to most foreign currencies, including the euro, South African rand, British pound, Brazilian real, Mexican peso and Australian dollar, which had an unfavorable impact on the Eurasia and Africa, Europe, Latin America, Pacific and Bottling Investments operating segments. The unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the aforementioned currencies was partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen, which had a favorable impact on the Pacific operating segment. Refer to the heading "Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position Foreign Exchange." Net Operating Revenues by Operating Segment Information about our net operating revenues by operating segment as a percentage of Company net operating revenues is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Eurasia & Africa 6.9 % 6.4 % 6.7 % Europe 12.6 13.9 15.0 Latin America 11.0 12.0 11.3 North America 31.7 26.4 25.7 Pacific 14.1 14.6 13.7 Bottling Investments 23.4 26.4 27.3 Corporate 0.3 0.3 0.3 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % The percentage contribution of each operating segment has changed due to net operating revenues in certain operating segments growing at a faster rate compared to the other operating segments. Net operating revenue growth rates are impacted by sales volume, structural changes, price and product/geographic mix, and foreign currency fluctuations. In 2010, the percentage of the Companys net operating revenues contributed by our North America operating segment increased by 5.3 percent, primarily due to our acquisition of CCEs North American business and sales related to our new license agreements with DPS. In 2011, we expect the percentage contribution by our North America operating segment to increase from 2010 due to the full year impact of these structural items. During the fourth quarter of 2010, the first quarter of operation following our acquisition of CCEs North American business and the new license agreements with DPS, our North America operating segment contributed 45.8 percent of the Companys net operating revenues. Although the fourth quarter of 2010 may not be indicative of the full year 2011 percentage contribution, it provides trend information related to the potential future impact of these structural changes. In addition, in 2010, the percentage of the Companys net operating revenues contributed by our Bottling Investments operating segment decreased by 3.0 percent, primarily due to the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of the Companys adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB and the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE. Refer to the heading "Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements," above. The size and timing of structural changes are not consistent from period to period. As a result, anticipating the impact of such events on future net operating revenues, and other financial statement line items, usually is not possible. We expect structural changes to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements in future periods. 61 Gross Profit Margin Year Ended December 31, 2010, versus Year Ended December 31, 2009 Our gross profit margin decreased to 63.9 percent from 64.2 percent. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of our acquisition of CCEs North American business, partially offset by favorable geographic mix, product mix, the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations and the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of the Companys adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. Refer to the heading "Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements," above, for additional information regarding the impact of our acquisition of CCEs North American business, the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations and the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of the Companys adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. The favorable geographic mix was primarily due to many of our emerging markets recovering from the global recession at a quicker pace than our developed markets. Although this shift in geographic mix has a negative impact on net operating revenues, it generally has a favorable impact on our gross profit margin due to the correlated impact it has on our product mix. The product mix in the majority of our emerging and developing markets is more heavily skewed toward our sparkling beverage products, which generally yield a higher gross profit margin compared to our still beverages and finished products. Refer to the heading "Net Operating Revenues," above. In 2011, we expect our gross profit margin to decline due to the full year impact of consolidating CCEs North American business, as well as an increase in commodity costs. The acquisition of CCEs North American business has resulted in a significant adjustment to our overall cost structure, especially in North America. Finished products operations typically have lower gross profit margins and the additional commodity risk could lead to higher raw material costs in 2011. Subsequent to this transaction, approximately 35 percent of our consolidated cost of goods sold is comprised of the raw material and conversion cost associated with the following inputs: (1) sweeteners, (2) metals, (3) juices and (4) PET. The majority of these costs are incurred by our North America and Bottling Investments operating segments. We anticipate that the cost of underlying commodities related to these inputs will continue to face upward pressure. We expect the full year 2011 impact of increased commodity costs on our total company results to range between $300 million and $400 million. Upon the close of our acquisition of CCEs North American business, we increased our hedging activities related to certain commodities in order to mitigate a portion of the price risk associated with forecasted purchases. Many of the derivative financial instruments used by the Company to mitigate the risk associated with these commodity exposures do not qualify for hedge accounting. As a result, the change in fair value of these derivative instruments will be included as a component of net income each reporting period. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Year Ended December 31, 2009, versus Year Ended December 31, 2008 Our gross profit margin decreased to 64.2 percent in 2009 from 64.4 percent in 2008, primarily due to foreign currency fluctuations, the growth of our finished products operations, unfavorable geographic mix as a result of growth in our emerging and developing markets, our current focus to drive greater affordability initiatives across many key markets, and unfavorable channel and product mix in certain key markets. The unfavorable impact of the previously mentioned items was partially offset by the favorable impact of price increases in certain markets, lower costs related to several key commodities and the sale of certain bottling operations in 2008. Generally, bottling and finished products operations produce higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins compared to concentrate and syrup operations. Bottling operations sold in 2008 included Remil and a portion of our ownership interest in Coca Cola Pakistan, which resulted in its deconsolidation. Refer to the heading "Other Income (Loss) Net," below, and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 62  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The following table sets forth the significant components of selling, general and administrative expenses (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Stock based compensation expense $ 380 $ 241 $ 266 Advertising expenses 2,917 2,791 2,998 Bottling and distribution expenses 3,902 2,627 2,815 Other operating expenses 5,959 5,699 5,695 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 13,158 $ 11,358 $ 11,774 Year Ended December 31, 2010, versus Year Ended December 31, 2009 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $1,800 million, or 16 percent. Foreign currency fluctuations increased selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately 1 percent. The increase in stock based compensation was primarily related to higher payouts tied to performance in conjunction with our long term incentive compensation programs and the impact of modifications made to certain replacement performance share unit awards issued by the Company in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business. The Company modified primarily all of these replacement performance share unit awards to eliminate the remaining holding period, which resulted in approximately $74 million of accelerated expense in the fourth quarter of 2010. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in advertising expenses reflected the Companys continued investment in our brands and building market execution capabilities. The increase in bottling and distribution expenses was primarily related to the impact of our acquisition of CCEs North American business and our continued investments in our other bottling operations. The unfavorable impact of these items was partially offset by the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of the Companys adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. These entities are primarily bottling operations and accounted for approximately 2 percent of the Companys consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses in 2009. Bottling and distribution expenses were also reduced due to the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE. Refer to the heading "Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements," above, for additional information related to significant structural changes. In 2011, our pension expense is expected to increase by approximately $60 million compared to 2010. The anticipated increase is primarily due to the impact of our acquisition of CCEs North American business and a decrease in our discount rate compared to 2010. The expected unfavorable impact of these items will be partially offset by the expected favorable impact of approximately $800 million of anticipated contributions to various plans in 2011, of which approximately $750 million was contributed in the first quarter of 2011. Approximately half of the anticipated 2011 contributions will be allocated to our primary U.S. pension plans. Refer to the heading "Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position" for information related to these contributions. Refer to the heading "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Pension Plan Valuations," and Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the discount rates used by the Company. As of December 31, 2010, we had $457 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share based compensation arrangements granted under our plans. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.7 years as stock based compensation expense. This expected cost does not include the impact of any future stock based compensation awards. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Year Ended December 31, 2009, versus Year Ended December 31, 2008 Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $416 million, or 4 percent. The decrease was primarily attributable to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, which decreased selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately 4 percent. Advertising expenses were impacted by shifts in our marketing and media spend strategies, primarily due to spending more marketing dollars toward in store activations, loyalty points programs and point of sale marketing. Many of these strategies impact net operating revenues instead of marketing expenses. Refer to the heading "Net Operating Revenues," above. The decrease in bottling and distribution expenses was primarily attributable to the full year impact of certain bottling operations sold in 2008. Bottling operations sold in 2008 included Remil and a 63 portion of our ownership interest in Coca Cola Pakistan, which resulted in its deconsolidation. Other operating expenses reflects the impact of an increase in pension costs and higher short term incentive costs, partially offset by savings generated from the Companys ongoing productivity initiatives. The increase in our pension expense was primarily attributable to the significant decline in the value of our pension plan assets precipitated by the credit crisis and financial system instability in 2008. As a result of this decline, along with a decrease in the discount rate, our 2009 pension costs increased by $103 million. Other Operating Charges Other operating charges incurred by operating segment were as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Eurasia & Africa $ 7 $ 4 $ 1 Europe 50 7 Latin America 1 North America 133 31 56 Pacific 22 1 Bottling Investments 122 141 46 Corporate 485 129 246 Total $ 819 $ 313 $ 350 In 2010, the Company incurred other operating charges of approximately $819 million, which consisted of $478 million associated with the Companys productivity, integration and restructuring initiatives, $250 million related to charitable contributions, $81 million due to transaction costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business and the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE and $10 million of charges related to bottling activities in Eurasia. The Companys integration activities include costs associated with the integration of CCEs North American business, as well as the integration of 18 German bottling and distribution operations acquired in 2007. The charitable contributions were primarily attributable to a cash donation to The Coca Cola Foundation. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the transaction costs. In 2010, the Company began an integration initiative related to our acquisition of CCEs North American business, which resulted in total expenses of $135 million. These expenses were primarily related to both internal and external costs associated with the development and design of our future operating framework. These charges impacted the North America and Corporate operating segments. Our acquisition of CCEs North American business closed on October 2, 2010. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe this acquisition will result in an evolved franchise system that will enable us to better serve the unique needs of the North American market. The creation of a unified operating system will strategically position us to better market and distribute our nonalcoholic beverage brands in North America. We are reconfiguring our manufacturing, supply chain and logistics operations to achieve cost reductions over time. Once fully integrated, we expect to generate operational synergies of at least $350 million per year. We anticipate that these operational synergies will be phased in over the next four years, and that we will begin to fully realize the annual benefit from these synergies in the fourth year. We currently expect to realize approximately $140 million to $150 million of these synergies in 2011. Upon completion of the CCE transaction, we combined the management of the acquired North American business with the management of our existing foodservice business, Minute Maid and Odwalla juice businesses, North America supply chain operations and Company owned bottling operations in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, into a unified bottling and customer service organization called CCR. In addition, we reshaped our remaining CCNA operations into an organization that primarily provides franchise leadership and consumer marketing and innovation for the North American market. As a result of the transaction and related reorganization, our North American businesses operate as aligned and agile organizations with distinct capabilities, responsibilities and strengths. The Company currently expects the total cost of these integration initiatives to be approximately $425 million and anticipates recognizing these charges over the next three years. 64 The Companys integration initiatives include costs related to the integration of 18 German bottling and distribution operations acquired in 2007. The Company began these integration initiatives in 2008 and has incurred total pretax expenses of approximately $225 million since they commenced. The expenses recorded in connection with these integration activities have been primarily due to involuntary terminations. The Company is currently reviewing other integration and restructuring opportunities within the German bottling and distribution operations, which if implemented will result in additional charges in future periods. However, as of December 31, 2010, the Company had not finalized any additional plans. Refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to this integration initiative. The Company has recognized costs of approximately $352 million related to our ongoing productivity initiatives since they commenced in the first quarter of 2008. The Company is targeting $500 million in annualized savings from productivity initiatives by the end of 2011 to provide additional flexibility to invest for growth. The savings are expected to be generated in a number of areas and include aggressively managing operating expenses supported by lean techniques, redesigning key processes to drive standardization and effectiveness, better leveraging our size and scale, and driving savings in indirect costs through the implementation of a "procure to pay" program. In realizing these savings, the Company expects to incur total costs of approximately $500 million by the end of 2011. The Company believes we are on track to achieve our $500 million target in annualized savings by the end of 2011. Refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the Companys ongoing productivity initiatives. In 2009, the Company incurred other operating charges of $313 million, which consisted of $273 million related to the Companys productivity, integration and restructuring initiatives and $40 million due to asset impairments. Refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our productivity, integration and restructuring initiatives. The impairment charges were related to a $23 million impairment of an intangible asset and a $17 million impairment of a building. The impairment of the intangible asset was due to a change in the expected useful life of the asset, which was previously determined to have an indefinite life. The $17 million impairment was due to a change in disposal strategy related to a building that is no longer occupied. The Company had originally intended to sell the building along with the related land. However, we have determined that the maximum potential sales proceeds would likely be realized through the sale of vacant land. As a result, the building was removed. The land is not considered held for sale, primarily due to the fact that it is not probable a sale would be completed within one year. In 2008, the Company incurred other operating charges of $350 million, which consisted of $249 million due to productivity and restructuring initiatives, $63 million related to contract termination fees and $38 million due to asset impairments. Refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our productivity and restructuring initiatives. The contract termination fees were primarily the result of penalties incurred by the Company to terminate existing supply and co packer agreements. The asset impairment charges were primarily due to the write down of manufacturing lines that produced product packaging materials. 65 Operating Income and Operating Margin Information about our operating income contribution by operating segment on a percentage basis is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Eurasia & Africa 11.6 % 9.8 % 9.9 % Europe 35.2 35.8 37.6 Latin America 28.5 24.8 24.8 North America 18.0 20.7 18.8 Pacific 24.2 22.9 22.0 Bottling Investments 2.7 2.2 3.1 Corporate (20.2 ) (16.2 ) (16.2 ) Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Information about our operating margin on a consolidated basis and by operating segment is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Consolidated 24.1 % 26.6 % 26.4 % Eurasia & Africa 40.4 % 41.0 % 39.1 % Europe 67.3 68.4 66.4 Latin America 62.0 55.2 57.9 North America 13.6 20.7 19.3 Pacific 41.4 41.6 42.6 Bottling Investments 2.8 2.2 3.0 Corporate * * * * Calculation is not meaningful. As demonstrated by the tables above, the percentage contribution to operating income and operating margin by operating segment fluctuated from year to year. Operating income and operating margin by operating segment were influenced by a variety of factors and events including the following: In 2010, foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted consolidated operating income by approximately 3 percent. The favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was primarily due to a weaker U.S. dollar compared to most foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Brazilian real, South African rand and Australian dollar, which had a favorable impact on the Eurasia and Africa, Latin America, Pacific and Bottling Investments operating segments. The favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to the aforementioned currencies was partially offset by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the euro and British pound, which had an unfavorable impact on the Europe and Bottling Investments operating segments. Refer to the heading "Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position Foreign Exchange." In 2010, operating income was favorably impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by approximately 7 percent for Eurasia and Africa, 3 percent for Latin America, 8 percent for Pacific and 9 percent for Bottling Investments. Operating income was unfavorably impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by approximately 1 percent for Europe. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates had a nominal impact on operating income for North America and Corporate. In 2010, our consolidated operating margin was favorably impacted by geographic mix. The favorable geographic mix was primarily due to many of our emerging markets recovering from the global recession at a quicker pace than our developed markets. Although this shift in geographic mix has a negative impact on net operating revenues, it generally has a favorable impact on our gross profit margin and operating margin due to the correlated impact it has on our product mix. The product mix in the majority of our emerging and developing markets is more heavily skewed toward products in our sparkling beverage portfolio, which generally yield a higher gross profit margin compared to our still beverages and finished products. 66 In 2010, our consolidated operating margin was favorably impacted by the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of the Companys adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. These entities are primarily bottling operations and have been accounted for under the equity method of accounting since they were deconsolidated on January 1, 2010. Generally, bottling and finished products operations produce higher net revenues but lower operating margins compared to concentrate and syrup operations. The majority of the deconsolidated entities had previously been included in our Bottling Investments operating segment. In 2010, the operating margin for the Latin America operating segment was favorably impacted by the sale of 50 percent of our ownership interest in Le&atilde;o Junior resulting in its deconsolidation, as well as the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of the Companys adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. Price and product mix also favorably impacted Latin Americas operating income and operating margin during the year. In 2010, the operating margin for the North America operating segment was unfavorably impacted by the Companys acquisition of CCEs North American business. Generally, bottling and finished products operations have higher net operating revenues but lower operating margins when compared to concentrate and syrup operations. Refer to the heading "Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements," above. In 2010, operating income for the North America operating segment was reduced by $74 million due to the acceleration of expense associated with certain share based replacement awards issued in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2010, operating income for the North America operating segment was negatively impacted by $235 million, primarily due to the elimination of gross profit in inventory on intercompany sales and an inventory fair value adjustment as a result of our acquisition of CCEs North American business. Prior to the acquisition, we recognized the profit associated with concentrate sales when the concentrate was sold to CCE, excluding the portion that was deemed to be intercompany due to our previous ownership interest in CCE. However, subsequent to the acquisition, the Company will not recognize the profit associated with concentrate sold to CCEs legacy North American business until the finished beverage products made from those concentrates are sold. In 2010, operating income for the North America operating segment was reduced by $20 million due to the amortization of favorable supply contracts acquired in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business. In 2010, operating income was reduced by $7 million for Eurasia and Africa, $50 million for Europe, $133 million for North America, $22 million for Pacific, $122 million for Bottling Investments and $485 million for Corporate, primarily due to the Companys productivity, integration and restructuring initiatives, charitable donations, transaction costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business and the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE and other charges related to bottling activities in Eurasia. Refer to the heading "Other Operating Charges," above. In 2009, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted consolidated operating income by approximately 11 percent. The unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to most foreign currencies, including the euro, South African rand, British pound, Brazilian real, Mexican peso and Australian dollar, which had an unfavorable impact on the Eurasia and Africa, Europe, Latin America, Pacific and Bottling Investments operating segments. The unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the aforementioned currencies was partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen, which had a favorable impact on the Pacific operating segment. Refer to the heading "Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position Foreign Exchange." In 2009, operating income was unfavorably impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by approximately 15 percent for Eurasia and Africa, 11 percent for Europe, 18 percent for Latin America, 1 percent for North America, 19 percent for Bottling Investments and 4 percent for Corporate. Operating income was favorably impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by approximately 3 percent for Pacific. 67 In 2009, shifts in our marketing and media spend strategies favorably impacted the operating margin in the majority of our operating segments. The shift was primarily due to spending more marketing dollars toward in store activations, improving shelf impact, loyalty points programs and point of sale marketing. Many of these strategies are recorded as deductions from revenues instead of marketing expenses. Refer to the heading "Net Operating Revenues," above. In 2009, lower commodity prices favorably impacted North Americas operating margin. In 2009, the operating margins for the Latin America and North America operating segments were unfavorably impacted by the growth of our finished goods businesses. Generally, bottling and finished products operations produce higher net revenues but lower operating margins compared to concentrate and syrup operations. In 2009, our consolidated operating margin was favorably impacted by the sale of certain bottling operations during 2008, including Remil and a portion of our ownership interest in Coca Cola Pakistan, which resulted in its deconsolidation. Generally, bottling and finished products operations produce higher net revenues but lower operating margins compared to concentrate and syrup operations. In 2009, operating income was reduced by approximately $4 million for Eurasia and Africa, $7 million for Europe, $31 million for North America, $1 million for Pacific, $141 million for Bottling Investments and $129 million for Corporate, primarily as a result of restructuring costs, the Companys ongoing productivity initiatives and asset impairments. Refer to the heading "Other Operating Charges," above. In 2008, operating income was reduced by approximately $1 million for Eurasia and Africa, $1 million for Latin America, $56 million for North America, $46 million for Bottling Investments and $246 million for Corporate, primarily due to restructuring costs, contract termination fees, productivity initiatives and asset impairments. Refer to the heading "Other Operating Charges," above. Interest Income Year Ended December 31, 2010, versus Year Ended December 31, 2009 Interest income increased by $68 million, or 27 percent. The increase was primarily due to the impact of higher average cash and short term investment balances, partially offset by lower average interest rates. Year Ended December 31, 2009, versus Year Ended December 31, 2008 Interest income decreased by $84 million, or 25 percent. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest rates, partially offset by the impact of higher short term investment balances. Interest Expense Year Ended December 31, 2010, versus Year Ended December 31, 2009 Interest expense increased $378 million, primarily due to a $342 million charge related to the premiums paid to repurchase long term debt and the costs associated with the settlement of treasury rate locks issued in connection with the debt tender offer. The increase also reflects the impact of interest expense on debt assumed from CCE. In connection with the Companys acquisition of CCEs North American business, we assumed $266 million of short term borrowings and $7,602 million of long term debt. The estimated fair value of the long term debt was approximately $9,345 million as of the acquisition date. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we recorded the assumed debt at its fair value as of the acquisition date. On November 15, 2010, the Company issued $4,500 million of long term notes and used some of the proceeds to repurchase $2,910 million of long term debt. The remaining cash from the issuance was used to reduce our outstanding commercial paper balance. As of December 31, 2010, the carrying value of the Companys long term debt included approximately $994 million of fair value adjustments related to the debt assumed from CCE. These fair value adjustments will be amortized over a weighted average period of approximately 15 years, which is equal to the weighted average maturity of the assumed debt to which these fair value adjustments relate. The amortization of these fair value adjustments will be a reduction of interest expense in future periods, which will typically result in our interest expense being less than the actual interest paid to service the debt. Total interest paid was $422 million in 2010. 68  Year Ended December 31, 2009, versus Year Ended December 31, 2008 Interest expense decreased by $83 million, or 19 percent. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates on short term debt, partially offset by the issuance of long term debt in the first quarter of 2009. The Company elected to replace a certain amount of commercial paper and short term debt with longer term debt, which resulted in the Company issuing long term notes in the principal amounts of $900 million at a rate of 3.625 percent and $1,350 million at a rate of 4.875 percent due March 15, 2014, and March 15, 2019, respectively. The interest rates on the long term notes are higher than the interest rates on our short term debt. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, interest expense in 2008 included the impact of the reclassification of approximately $17 million of previously unrecognized gains on interest rate locks from AOCI to interest expense, which was partially offset by approximately $9 million of losses related to the portion of cash flow hedges that were deemed to be ineffective. The reclassification was the result of a discontinued cash flow hedging relationship on interest rate locks, as it was no longer probable that we would issue the long term debt for which these hedges were designated. Equity Income (Loss) Net Year Ended December 31, 2010, versus Year Ended December 31, 2009 Equity income (loss) net represents our Companys proportionate share of net income or loss from each of our equity method investments. In 2010, equity income was $1,025 million, compared to equity income of $781 million in 2009, an increase of $244 million, or 31 percent. The increase was primarily due to our proportionate share of increased net income from certain of our equity method investees; the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations; a decrease in the Companys proportionate share of asset impairments and restructuring charges recorded by equity method investees; and the impact of the Companys adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. The impact of these items was partially offset by the impact of our acquisition of CCEs North American business, which resulted in the consolidation of CCEs North American business. As a result of this transaction, the Company stopped recording equity income related to CCE beginning October 2, 2010. Refer to the heading "Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements," above. The Companys adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB resulted in the deconsolidation of certain entities. These entities are primarily bottling operations and have been accounted for under the equity method of accounting since they were deconsolidated on January 1, 2010. Refer to the heading "Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements," above. The entities that have been deconsolidated accounted for approximately 4 percent of the Companys equity income in 2010. Year Ended December 31, 2009, versus Year Ended December 31, 2008 In 2009, equity income was $781 million, compared to an equity loss of $874 million in 2008, an increase of $1,655 million. In 2008, equity income (loss) net was impacted by our proportionate share of approximately $7.6 billion of pretax charges ($4.9 billion after tax) recorded by CCE due to impairments of its North American franchise rights. The Companys proportionate share of these charges was approximately $1.6 billion. Refer to the heading "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Goodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets," and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in equity income in 2009 was also partially attributable to our proportionate share of increased net income from certain of our equity method investees, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange fluctuations and the Companys proportionate share of asset impairments and restructuring charges recorded by equity method investees. Other Income (Loss) Net Other income (loss) net includes, among other things, the impact of foreign exchange gains and losses, dividend income, rental income, gains and losses related to the disposal of property, plant and equipment, realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities, realized gains and losses on available for sale securities, other than temporary impairments of available for sale securities and the accretion of expense related to certain acquisitions. The foreign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies. The effects of the remeasurement of these assets 69 and liabilities are partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2010, other income (loss) net was income of $5,185 million, primarily related to a $4,978 million gain related to the remeasurement of our equity investment in CCE to fair value upon the close of our acquisition of CCEs North American business and a $597 million gain related to the sale of all of our ownership interests in our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE. Refer to the heading "Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements," above, and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These gains were partially offset by a $265 million charge related to preexisting relationships with CCE and foreign currency exchange losses of $148 million. The charge related to preexisting relationships was primarily due to the write off of our investment in infrastructure programs with CCE. The foreign currency exchange losses were primarily due to a charge of approximately $103 million related to the remeasurement of our Venezuelan subsidiarys net assets. Refer to the heading "Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position Foreign Exchange." In addition to the items mentioned above, other income (loss) net also included a $23 million gain on the sale of 50 percent of our investment in Le&atilde;o Junior and $48 million of charges related to other than temporary impairments and a donation of preferred shares in one of our equity investees. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2009, other income (loss) net was income of $40 million, primarily related to a realized gain of approximately $44 million on the sale of equity securities classified as available for sale, $40 million from the sale of other investments and $18 million of dividend income from cost method investments. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the gain on the sale of available for sale securities. These gains were partially offset by approximately $34 million in net foreign currency exchange losses and an other than temporary impairment charge of approximately $27 million on a cost method investment. Refer to the heading "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Investments in Equity and Debt Securities," and Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2008, other income (loss) net was income of $39 million. The Company recognized gains on divestitures of approximately $119 million, primarily related to the sale of Remil to Coca Cola FEMSA and the sale of a portion of the Companys investment in Coca Cola Pakistan to Coca Cola Icecek A.S. ("Coca Cola Icecek"). Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other income (loss) net also included approximately $24 million in net foreign currency exchange gains in 2008. The gains on divestitures and net foreign currency exchange were partially offset by other than temporary impairment charges of approximately $81 million on available for sale securities. Refer to the heading "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Investments in Equity and Debt Securities," and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other income (loss) net also included approximately $46 million of realized and unrealized losses on trading securities. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate reflects tax benefits derived from significant operations outside the United States, which are generally taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent. A change in the mix of pretax income from these various tax jurisdictions can have a significant impact on the Companys periodic effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate of approximately 16.7 percent for the year ended December 31, 2010, included the following: an approximate 27 percent combined effective tax rate on the Companys productivity, integration and restructuring initiatives, charitable donations, transaction costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business and the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE and other charges related to bottling activities in Eurasia (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); a tax benefit of $34 million related to the remeasurement of our equity investment in CCE to fair value upon our acquisition of CCEs North American business. The tax benefit reflects the impact of reversing deferred tax liabilities associated with our equity investment in CCE prior to the acquisition (refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); an approximate 37 percent effective tax rate on charges related to preexisting relationships with CCE (refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); 70 an approximate 44 percent effective tax rate on the gain related to the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE (refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); an approximate 35 percent combined effective tax rate on the elimination of gross profit in inventory on intercompany sales and an inventory fair value adjustment as a result of our acquisition of CCEs North American business (refer to the heading "Gross Profit Margin," above); an approximate 37 percent combined effective tax rate on the amortization of favorable supply contracts acquired in connection with our acquisition and mark to market gains related to non designated hedges that are associated with underlying transactions expected to occur in a future period; an approximate 38 percent effective tax rate on the acceleration of expense associated with certain share based replacement awards issued in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business (refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); an approximate 4 percent combined effective tax rate on other than temporary impairments and a donation of preferred shares in one of our equity method investees (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); an approximate 33 percent combined effective tax rate on a charge related to the premiums paid to repurchase long term debt and the costs associated with the settlement of treasury rate locks issued in connection with the debt tender offer (refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); a zero percent effective tax rate on the remeasurement of our Venezuelan subsidiarys net assets (refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); an approximate 46 percent effective tax rate on the gain from the sale of 50 percent of our investment in Le&atilde;o Junior (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); an approximate 14 percent effective tax rate on our proportionate share of unusual tax charges, asset impairments, restructuring charges, transaction costs and a remeasurement gain recorded by equity method investees (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); a tax charge of approximately $14 million related to new legislation that changed the tax treatment of Medicare Part D subsidies (refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); a net tax charge of approximately $216 million, primarily related to deferred tax expense on certain current year undistributed foreign earnings that are not considered indefinitely reinvested (refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); and a net tax charge of approximately $67 million related to amounts required to be recorded for changes to our uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties (refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our effective tax rate of approximately 22.8 percent for the year ended December 31, 2009, included the following: an approximate 17 percent combined effective tax rate on restructuring charges, productivity initiatives and asset impairments (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); an approximate 21 percent combined effective tax rate on our proportionate share of restructuring and asset impairment charges recorded by equity method investees (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); a zero percent effective tax rate on an other than temporary impairment of a cost method investment (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); a zero percent effective tax rate on realized gains on sales of available for sale securities (refer to Note 3 and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); a tax benefit of approximately $17 million due to the impact that a tax rate change had on certain deferred tax liabilities (refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); 71 a tax charge of approximately $15 million related to the recognition of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets (refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); and a net tax benefit of approximately $13 million related to amounts required to be recorded for changes to our uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties (refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our effective tax rate of approximately 21.7 percent for the year ended December 31, 2008, included the following: an approximate 20 percent combined effective tax rate on restructuring charges, other than temporary impairments of available for sale securities, contract termination fees, productivity initiatives and asset impairments recorded by the Company (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); an approximate 23 percent combined effective tax rate on our proportionate share of asset impairment and restructuring charges recorded by equity method investees, primarily related to impairment charges recorded by CCE (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); an approximate 24 percent combined effective tax rate on gains from divestitures (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); a tax charge of approximately $10 million related to the recognition of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets (refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); and a net tax benefit of approximately $5 million, primarily related to amounts required to be recorded for changes to our uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties (refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). As of December 31, 2010, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was approximately $387 million. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the net effect would be a benefit to the Companys effective tax rate of approximately $163 million, exclusive of any benefits related to interest and penalties. The remaining approximately $224 million, which was recorded as a deferred tax asset, primarily represents tax benefits that would be received in different tax jurisdictions in the event that the Company did not prevail on all uncertain tax positions. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A reconciliation of the changes in the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefit amounts is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Beginning balance of unrecognized tax benefits $ 354 $ 369 $ 643 Increases related to prior period tax positions 26 49 52 Decreases related to prior period tax positions (10 ) (28 ) (4 ) Increases due to current period tax positions 33 16 47 Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities (27 ) (254 ) Reductions as a result of a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations (1 ) (73 ) (36 ) Increase due to acquisition of CCEs North American business 6 Increases (decreases) from effects of exchange rates (21 ) 48 (79 ) Ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits $ 387 $ 354 $ 369 In 2008, agreements were reached between the U.S. government and a foreign government concerning the allocation of income between the two tax jurisdictions. Pursuant to these agreements, we made cash payments during the third quarter of 2008 that constituted payments of tax and interest. These payments were partially offset by tax credits taken in the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2008, and tax refunds and interest on refunds received in 2009. These benefits had been recorded as deferred tax assets in prior periods. The settlements did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated income statement for the year ended December 31, 2008. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The Company had approximately $112 million, $94 million and $110 million in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Of these amounts, approximately $17 million, $16 million and $14 million of benefits were recognized through tax expense in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the reversal of this accrual would also be a benefit to the Companys effective tax rate. Based on current tax laws, the Companys effective tax rate in 2011 is expected to be approximately 23.5 percent to 24.5 percent before considering the effect of any unusual or special items that may affect our tax rate in future years. 72  Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position We believe our ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths. The near term outlook for our business remains strong, and we expect to generate substantial cash flows from operations in 2011. As a result of our expected strong cash flows from operations, we have significant flexibility to meet our financial commitments. We typically fund a significant portion of our dividends, capital expenditures, contractual obligations, share repurchases and acquisitions with cash generated from operating activities. We rely on external funding for additional cash requirements. The Company does not typically raise capital through the issuance of stock. Instead, we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase our return on shareowners equity. Refer to the heading "Cash Flows from Financing Activities," below. Our debt financing includes the use of an extensive commercial paper program as part of our overall cash management strategy. The Company reviews its optimal mix of short term and long term debt regularly. On October 2, 2010, we acquired CCEs North American business. Under the terms of the merger agreement, the Company acquired the 67 percent of CCEs North American business that was not already owned by the Company for consideration that included: (1) the Companys 33 percent indirect ownership interest in CCEs European operations; (2) cash consideration; and (3) replacement awards issued to certain current and former employees of CCEs North American and corporate operations. At closing, CCE shareowners other than the Company exchanged their CCE common stock for common stock in a new entity, which was renamed Coca Cola Enterprises, Inc. (which is referred to herein as "New CCE") and which continues to hold the European operations held by CCE prior to the acquisition. At closing, New CCE became 100 percent owned by shareowners that held shares of common stock of CCE immediately prior to the closing, other than the Company. As a result of this transaction, the Company does not own any interest in New CCE. Although the CCE transaction was structured to be primarily cashless, under the terms of the merger agreement, we agreed to assume approximately $8.9 billion of CCE debt. In the event that the actual CCE debt on the acquisition date was less than the agreed amount, we agreed to make a cash payment to New CCE for the difference. As of the acquisition date, the debt assumed by the Company was approximately $7.9 billion. The total cash consideration paid to New CCE as part of the transaction was approximately $1.3 billion, which included approximately $1.0 billion related to the debt shortfall. On November 15, 2010, the Company issued $4,500 million of long term notes and used some of the proceeds to repurchase $2,910 million of long term debt. The remaining cash from the issuance was used to reduce our outstanding commercial paper balance. The Company recorded a charge of $342 million related to the premiums paid to repurchase the long term debt and the costs associated with the settlement of treasury rate locks issued in connection with the debt tender offer. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the Companys long term debt. In a concurrent transaction, we sold all of our ownership interests in our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE for approximately $0.9 billion in cash on October 2, 2010. The Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations were wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company prior to the divestiture. This divestiture was pursuant to the terms of the definitive agreement entered into on March 20, 2010. In addition, we granted New CCE the right to acquire our majority interest in CCEAG, 18 to 39 months after the date of the merger agreement, at the then current fair value and subject to terms and conditions as mutually agreed. In contemplation of the closing of our acquisition of CCEs North American business, we reached an agreement with DPS to distribute certain DPS brands in territories where DPS brands had been distributed by CCE prior to the CCE transaction. Under the terms of our agreement with DPS, concurrently with the closing of the CCE transaction, we entered into license agreements with DPS to distribute Dr Pepper trademark brands in the U.S., Canada Dry in the Northeast U.S., and Canada Dry and C Plus in Canada, and we made a net one time cash payment of $715 million to DPS. Under the license agreements, the Company agreed to meet certain performance obligations to distribute DPS products in retail and foodservice accounts and vending machines. The license agreements have initial terms of 20 years, with automatic 20 year renewal periods unless otherwise terminated under the terms of the agreements. The license agreements replaced agreements between DPS and CCE existing immediately prior to the completion of the CCE transaction. In addition, we entered into an agreement with DPS to include Dr Pepper and Diet Dr Pepper in our Coca Cola Freestyle fountain dispensers in certain outlets throughout the United States. The Coca Cola Freestyle agreement has a term of 20 years. 73 The Company contributed $77 million to our pension plans during the year ended December 31, 2010. In 2011, we expect to contribute $800 million to various plans, of which approximately $750 million was contributed in the first quarter of 2011. Approximately half of the expected 2011 contributions will be allocated to our primary U.S. pension plans. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The government in Venezuela has enacted certain monetary policies that restrict the ability of companies to pay dividends from retained earnings. As of December 31, 2010, cash held by our Venezuelan subsidiary accounted for approximately 2 percent of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance. In the first quarter of 2010 the Venezuelan government announced a currency devaluation and Venezuela was determined to be a hyperinflationary economy. As a result, our local subsidiary was required to use the U.S. dollar as its functional currency, and we recorded a net remeasurement loss of $103 million during the first quarter of 2010 in the line item other income (loss) net in our consolidated statement of income. As of December 31, 2010, our Venezuelan subsidiary held monetary assets of approximately $200 million. In addition to the foreign currency exchange exposure related to our Venezuelan subsidiarys net assets, we also sell concentrate to our bottling partner in Venezuela from outside the country. These sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Some of our concentrate sales were approved by the CADIVI to receive the official rate for essential goods of 2.6 bolivars per U.S. dollar prior to the elimination of the official rate for essential goods in December 2010. Prior to the elimination of the official rate for essential goods, our bottling partner in Venezuela was able to convert bolivars to U.S. dollars to settle our receivables related to sales approved by the CADIVI. Therefore, as of December 31, 2010, our receivable balance related to concentrate sales that had been approved by the CADIVI was not significant. If we are unable to utilize a government approved exchange rate mechanism for future concentrate sales to our bottling partner in Venezuela, the amount of receivables related to these sales will increase. In addition to the Companys cash balances and commercial paper program, we also maintain $4,850 million in lines of credit for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backup, of which approximately $4,597 million was unused and available as of December 31, 2010. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These backup lines of credit expire at various times from 2011 through 2012. These credit facilities are subject to normal banking terms and conditions. Some of the financial arrangements require compensating balances, none of which is presently significant to our Company. We have evaluated the financial stability of each bank and believe we can access the funds, if needed. Based on all the aforementioned factors, the Company believes its current liquidity position is strong, and we will continue to meet all our financial commitments for the foreseeable future. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $9,532 million, $8,186 million and $7,571 million, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities increased $1,346 million, or 16 percent, in 2010 compared to 2009. This increase was primarily attributable to increased receipts from customers, the impact of our acquisition of CCEs North American business, the favorable impact of exchange rates on operations and a decrease in contributions to our pension plans. The impact of these items was partially offset by higher tax payments in 2010. The increase in cash receipts from customers was primarily due to an increase in net operating revenues. Refer to the heading "Net Operating Revenues," above. Also, in 2009, cash flows from operating activities included the receipt of a $183 million special dividend from Coca Cola Hellenic. The Company contributed approximately $77 million to our pension plans during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $269 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. Cash flows from operating activities increased $615 million, or 8 percent, in 2009 compared to 2008. This increase was primarily attributable to lower tax payments, decreased payments to suppliers and vendors, and the receipt of a $183 million special dividend from Coca Cola Hellenic. The special dividend received from Coca Cola Hellenic was incremental to its normal quarterly dividend. We classified the receipt of this special dividend in cash flows from operating activities due to the fact that our cumulative equity in earnings from Coca Cola Hellenic exceeded the cumulative distributions received; therefore, the special dividend was deemed to be a return on our investment and not a return of our investment. The impact of these items was partially offset by increased contributions to our pension plans. The increase in contributions to our pension plans was primarily due to the decline in fair value of our pension 74 plan assets in 2008. The Company contributed approximately $269 million to our pension plans during the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to approximately $96 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Our cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities are summarized as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Purchases of short term investments $ (4,579 ) $ (2,130 ) $ Proceeds from disposals of short term investments 4,032 Acquisitions and investments (2,511 ) (300 ) (759 ) Purchases of other investments (132 ) (22 ) (240 ) Proceeds from disposals of bottling companies and other investments 972 240 479 Purchases of property, plant and equipment (2,215 ) (1,993 ) (1,968 ) Proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment 134 104 129 Other investing activities (106 ) (48 ) (4 ) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (4,405 ) $ (4,149 ) $ (2,363 ) Short term Investments In 2010, purchases of short term investments were $4,579 million, and proceeds from disposals of short term investments were $4,032 million. This activity resulted in a net cash outflow of $547 million during the year. In 2009, purchases of short term investments were $2,130 million. These short term investments are time deposits that have maturities of greater than three months but less than one year, and are classified in the line item short term investments in our consolidated balance sheets. The Company began investing in longer term time deposits during the fourth quarter of 2009 to match the maturities of short term debt issued as part of our commercial paper program. Refer to the heading "Cash Flows from Financing Activities," below. These time deposits are classified in the line item short term investments in our consolidated balance sheets. Acquisitions and Investments In 2010, the Companys acquisition and investment activities totaled $2,511 million, which was primarily related to our acquisition of CCEs North American business, DPS license agreements, our acquisition of OAO Nidan Juices ("Nidan"), a Russian juice company, and our additional investment in Fresh Trading Ltd. ("innocent"). The Company and the existing shareowners of innocent have a series of outstanding put and call options for the Company to potentially acquire the remaining shares not already owned by the Company. The put and call options are exercisable in stages between 2013 and 2014. Refer to the heading "Operations Review Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements," and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our acquisitions during the year. In 2009, our Companys acquisition and investment activities totaled $300 million. None of the acquisitions or investments was individually significant. Included in these investment activities was the acquisition of a minority interest in innocent. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our acquisitions during the year. In 2008, our Companys acquisition and investment activities totaled $759 million, which included the acquisition of brands and licenses in Denmark and Finland from Carlsberg Group Beverages for approximately $225 million. None of the other acquisitions during 2008 was individually significant. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Proceeds from Disposals of Bottling Companies and Other Investments In 2010, proceeds from disposals of bottling companies and other investments were $972 million. These proceeds were primarily related to the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE for approximately $0.9 billion and the sale of 50 percent of our investment in Le&atilde;o Junior for approximately $83 million. Refer to the 75 heading "Operations Review Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements," and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In 2008, proceeds from disposals of bottling companies and other investments included proceeds of approximately $275 million, net of the cash balance as of the disposal date, related to the sale of Remil to Coca Cola FEMSA. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchases of Property, Plant and Equipment Net Purchases of property, plant and equipment net of disposals for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were approximately $2,081 million, $1,889 million and $1,839 million, respectively. The increase in 2010 compared to 2009 and 2008 was primarily attributable to the acquisition of CCEs North American business. Refer to the heading "Operations Review Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements." Generally, bottling and finished products operations are more capital intensive compared to concentrate and syrup operations. Total capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment (including our investments in information technology) and the percentage of such totals by operating segment were as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Capital expenditures $ 2,215 $ 1,993 $ 1,968 Eurasia & Africa 2.7 % 3.5 % 3.4 % Europe 1.5 3.4 3.9 Latin America 4.2 6.2 2.9 North America 32.1 23.0 25.0 Pacific 4.6 4.6 9.0 Bottling Investments 42.5 41.4 41.6 Corporate 12.4 17.9 14.2 In 2011, our annual capital expenditures will increase as we integrate CCEs North American business and make investments to further enhance our operational effectiveness. The net result of these North America specific expenditures will result in an estimated increase of $1.0 billion to our 2011 capital expenditure program. In addition, we plan to make further strategic investments in 2011, primarily related to expanding our production and sales capabilities within our Bottling Investments operating segment. As a result, we expect our annual 2011 capital expenditures to range between $3.0 billion and $3.2 billion. We currently expect this level of capital expenditure to remain relatively constant for the next two years, but anticipate these levels to decrease over time. Other Investing Activities In 2010, other investing activities primarily related to the impact of the deconsolidation of certain entities due to the Companys adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. Refer to the heading "Operations Review Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements," and Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The cash flow impact in other investing activities primarily represents the balance of cash and cash equivalents on the deconsolidated entities balance sheets as of December 31, 2009. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Our cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities were as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Issuances of debt $ 15,251 $ 14,689 $ 4,337 Payments of debt (13,403 ) (12,326 ) (4,308 ) Issuances of stock 1,666 664 595 Purchases of stock for treasury (2,961 ) (1,518 ) (1,079 ) Dividends (4,068 ) (3,800 ) (3,521 ) Other financing activities 50 (2 ) (9 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (3,465 ) $ (2,293 ) $ (3,985 ) 76 Debt Financing Our Company maintains debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flows, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. We use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners equity. This exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. Our interest expense may also be affected by our credit ratings. As of December 31, 2010, our long term debt was rated "A+" by Standard & Poors, "Aa3" by Moodys and "A+" by Fitch. Our commercial paper program was rated "A 1" by Standard & Poors, "P 1" by Moodys and "F 1" by Fitch. In assessing our credit strength, all three agencies consider our capital structure (including the amount and maturity dates of our debt) and financial policies as well as the aggregated balance sheet and other financial information for the Company. In addition, some rating agencies also consider financial information for certain bottlers, including New CCE, Coca Cola Amatil, Coca Cola FEMSA and Coca Cola Hellenic. While the Company has no legal obligation for the debt of these bottlers, the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the Companys business model provides the Company with an incentive to keep these bottlers viable. It is our expectation that the credit rating agencies will continue using this methodology. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure, our major bottlers financial performance, changes in the credit rating agencies methodology in assessing our credit strength, or for any other reason, our cost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if certain bottlers credit ratings were to decline, the Companys share of equity income could be reduced as a result of the potential increase in interest expense for these bottlers. We monitor our financial ratios and, as indicated above, the rating agencies consider these ratios in assessing our credit ratings. Each rating agency employs a different aggregation methodology and has different thresholds for the various financial ratios. These thresholds are not necessarily permanent, nor are they always fully disclosed to our Company. Our global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the world, enabling us to raise funds at a low effective cost. This posture, coupled with active management of our mix of short term and long term debt and our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt, results in a lower overall cost of borrowing. Our debt management policies, in conjunction with our share repurchase programs and investment activity, can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets. Issuances and payments of debt included both short term and long term financing activities. On December 31, 2010, we had $4,850 million in lines of credit available for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backup, of which approximately $4,597 million was unused and available. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These backup lines of credit expire at various times from 2011 through 2012. In 2010, the Company had issuances of debt of $15,251 million, which included $1,171 million of net issuances of commercial paper and short term debt with maturities of 90 days or less and $9,503 million of issuances of commercial paper and short term debt with maturities greater than 90 days. In addition, on November 15, 2010, the Company issued $4,500 million of long term notes. The proceeds from the debt issuance were used to repurchase $2,910 million of long term debt, and the remainder was used to reduce our commercial paper balance. The long term notes issued on November 15, 2010, had the following general terms: $1,250 million total principal notes due May 15, 2012, at a variable interest rate of 3 month LIBOR plus 0.05 percent; $1,250 million total principal notes due November 15, 2013, at a fixed interest rate of 0.75 percent; $1,000 million total principal notes due November 15, 2015, at a fixed interest rate of 1.5 percent; and $1,000 million total principal notes due November 15, 2020, at a fixed interest rate of 3.15 percent. In 2010, the Company had payments of debt of $13,403 million, including the repurchased long term debt discussed above. Total payments of debt also included $9,667 million related to commercial paper and short term debt with maturities greater than 90 days. The Company recorded a charge of $342 million related to the premiums paid to repurchase the long term debt and the costs associated with the settlement of treasury rate locks issued in connection with the debt tender offer. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the Companys long term debt. 77  In 2009, the Company had issuances of debt of approximately $14,689 million and payments of debt of $12,326 million. The issuances of debt included approximately $12,397 million of issuances of commercial paper and short term debt with maturities greater than 90 days, as well as $900 million and $1,350 million of long term debt due March 15, 2014, and March 15, 2019, respectively. The payments of debt included approximately $1,861 million of net payments of commercial paper and short term debt with maturities of 90 days or less; $10,017 million related to commercial paper and short term debt with maturities greater than 90 days; and $448 million related to long term debt. The increase in issuances and payments of commercial paper with maturities of greater than 90 days was primarily due to a favorable interest rate environment on longer term commercial paper. As a result, the Company also began investing in longer term time deposits that have maturities of greater than three months. Refer to the heading "Cash Flows from Investing Activities." The issuances of debt in 2008 included approximately $4,001 million of issuances of commercial paper and short term debt with maturities of greater than 90 days, and approximately $194 million of net issuances of commercial paper and short term debt with maturities of 90 days or less. The payments of debt in 2008 included approximately $4,032 million related to commercial paper and short term debt with maturities of greater than 90 days. Issuances of Stock The issuances of stock in 2010, 2009 and 2008 primarily related to the exercise of stock options by Company employees. Share Repurchases On July 20, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a share repurchase program of up to 300 million shares of the Companys common stock. The program took effect on October 31, 2006. The table below presents annual shares repurchased and average price per share: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Number of shares repurchased (in millions) 49 26 18 Average price per share $ 63.85 $ 57.09 $ 58.01 Since the inception of our initial share repurchase program in 1984 through our current program as of December 31, 2010, we have purchased approximately 1.4 billion shares of our Companys common stock at an average price per share of $21.37. In addition to shares repurchased under the stock repurchase plans authorized by our Board of Directors, the Companys treasury stock activity also includes shares surrendered to the Company to pay the exercise price and or to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with so called stock swap exercises of employee stock options and or the vesting of restricted stock issued to employees. In 2010, we repurchased approximately $3.1 billion of our stock, of which $3.0 billion settled prior to December 31, 2010. We currently expect to repurchase an additional $2.0 billion to $2.5 billion of our stock during 2011. Dividends At its February 2011 meeting, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 7 percent, raising it to $0.47 per share, equivalent to a full year dividend of $1.88 per share in 2011. This is our 49th consecutive annual increase. Our annual common stock dividend was $1.76 per share, $1.64 per share and $1.52 per share in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The 2010 dividend represented a 7 percent increase from 2009, and the 2009 dividend represented an 8 percent increase from 2008. 78 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In accordance with the definition under SEC rules, the following qualify as off balance sheet arrangements: any obligation under certain guarantee contracts; a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets; any obligation under certain derivative instruments; and any obligation arising out of a material variable interest held by the registrant in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the registrant, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the registrant. As of December 31, 2010, we were contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties of approximately $683 million, of which approximately $336 million related to VIEs. These guarantees primarily are related to third party customers, bottlers, vendors and container manufacturing operations and have arisen through the normal course of business. These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees was individually significant. The amount represents the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make under the guarantees; however, we do not consider it probable that we will be required to satisfy these guarantees. Management concluded that the likelihood of any significant amounts being paid by our Company under these guarantees is not probable. As of December 31, 2010, we were not directly liable for the debt of any unconsolidated entity, and we did not have any retained or contingent interest in assets as defined above. Our Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had $4,850 million in lines of credit for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backup, of which $4,597 million was unused and available. While no amounts have been borrowed against these lines of credit, certain portions have been limited due to outstanding letters of credit related to collateral for claims incurred under our self insurance programs and for certain operating activities. These backup lines of credit expire at various times from 2011 through 2012. These credit facilities are subject to normal banking terms and conditions. Some of the financial arrangements require compensating balances, none of which is presently significant to our Company. 79 Aggregate Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2010, the Companys contractual obligations, including payments due by period, were as follows (in millions): Payments Due by Period Total 2011 20122013 20142015 2016 and Thereafter Short term loans and notes payable1: Commercial paper borrowings $ 7,535 $ 7,535 $ $ $ Lines of credit and other short term borrowings 565 565 Current maturities of long term debt2 1,266 1,266 Long term debt, net of current maturities2 13,076 3,800 3,392 5,884 Estimated interest payments3 7,686 696 1,282 1,027 4,681 Accrued income taxes4 273 273 Purchase obligations5 12,463 7,615 2,628 1,053 1,167 Marketing obligations6 4,557 1,652 1,691 468 746 Lease obligations 1,155 238 386 218 313 Total contractual obligations4 $ 48,576 $ 19,840 $ 9,787 $ 6,158 $ 12,791 1 Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding short term loans and notes payable. Upon payment of outstanding commercial paper, we typically issue new commercial paper. Lines of credit and other short term borrowings are expected to fluctuate depending upon current liquidity needs, especially at international subsidiaries. 2 Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding long term debt. We will consider several alternatives to settle this long term debt, including the use of cash flows from operating activities, issuance of commercial paper or issuance of other long term debt. 3 We calculated estimated interest payments for our long term fixed rate debt based on the applicable rates and payment dates. We typically expect to settle such interest payments with cash flows from operating activities and or short term borrowings. 4 Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding income taxes. As of December 31, 2010, the noncurrent portion of our income tax liability, including accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, was approximately $474 million, which was not included in the total above. At this time, the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of our income tax liability cannot be determined. In addition, any payments related to unrecognized tax benefits would be partially offset by reductions in payments in other jurisdictions. 5 Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including long term contractual obligations, open purchase orders, accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities. We expect to fund these obligations with cash flows from operating activities. 6 We expect to fund these marketing obligations with cash flows from operating activities. The total accrued benefit liability for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of December 31, 2010, was approximately $2,563 million. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This amount is impacted by, among other items, pension expense, funding levels, plan amendments, changes in plan demographics and assumptions, and the investment return on plan assets. Because the accrued liability does not represent expected liquidity needs, we did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 ("PPA") was enacted in August 2006 and established, among other things, new standards for funding of U.S. defined benefit pension plans. During 2008, the funded status of the Companys primary U.S. defined benefit pension plan declined as a result of the overall stock market decline. In early 2009, the Company contributed approximately $175 million to this plan. Subsequent to this contribution, the plan is sufficiently funded to maintain maximum flexibility as outlined in the PPA. We generally expect to fund all future contributions with cash flows from operating activities. Our international pension plans are generally funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations. In 2011, we expect to contribute approximately $800 million to various plans, of which approximately $750 million was contributed in the first quarter of 2011. Approximately half of the expected 2011 contributions will be allocated to our primary U.S. pension plans. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We did not include our estimated contributions to our various plans in the table above. As of December 31, 2010, the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. qualified pension plans was $4,837 million, and the fair value of plan assets was approximately $4,118 million. The majority of this underfunding was due to the negative impact that the recent credit crisis and financial system instability had on the value of our pension plan assets. 80 As of December 31, 2010, the projected benefit obligation of all pension plans other than the U.S. qualified pension plans was approximately $2,455 million, and the fair value of all other pension plan assets was approximately $1,379 million. The majority of this underfunding is attributable to an international pension plan for certain non U.S. employees that is unfunded due to tax law restrictions, as well as our unfunded U.S. nonqualified pension plans. These U.S. nonqualified pension plans provide, for certain associates, benefits that are not permitted to be funded through a qualified plan because of limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The expected benefit payments for these unfunded pension plans are not included in the table above. However, we anticipate annual benefit payments for these unfunded pension plans to be approximately $50 million in 2011 and remain near that level through 2030, decreasing annually thereafter. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In general, we are self insured for large portions of many different types of claims; however, we do use commercial insurance above our self insured retentions to reduce the Companys risk of catastrophic loss. Our reserves for the Companys self insured losses are estimated through actuarial procedures of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions, adjusted for our specific expectations based on our claim history. As of December 31, 2010, our self insurance reserves totaled approximately $502 million. Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We did not include estimated payments related to our self insurance reserves in the table above. Deferred income tax liabilities as of December 31, 2010, were approximately $4,279 million. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This amount is not included in the total contractual obligations table because we believe this presentation would not be meaningful. Deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective book bases, which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts. The results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods. As a result, scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading, because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs. Foreign Exchange Our international operations are subject to certain opportunities and risks, including currency fluctuations and governmental actions. We closely monitor our operations in each country and seek to adopt appropriate strategies that are responsive to changing economic and political environments, and to fluctuations in foreign currencies. We use 75 functional currencies. Due to our global operations, weakness in some of these currencies might be offset by strength in others. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, the weighted average exchange rates for foreign currencies in which the Company conducted operations (all operating currencies), and for certain individual currencies, strengthened (weakened) against the U.S. dollar as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 All operating currencies 3 % (9 )% 5 % Brazilian real 11 % (8 )% 6 % Mexican peso 6 (24 ) 0 Australian dollar 13 (8 ) 1 South African rand 11 (1 ) (18 ) British pound (2 ) (18 ) (9 ) Euro (5 ) (8 ) 9 Japanese yen 6 9 12 These percentages do not include the effects of our hedging activities and, therefore, do not reflect the actual impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on our operating results. Our foreign currency management program is designed to mitigate, over time, a portion of the impact of exchange rate changes on our net income and earnings per share. The total currency impact on operating income, including the effect of our hedging activities, was an increase of approximately 3 percent in 2010 and a decrease of approximately 11 percent in 2009. Based on the anticipated impact of hedging coverage in place, the Company expects currencies to have an even to slightly positive impact on operating income for the first quarter and full year of 2011. 81 Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies. The effects of the remeasurement of these assets and liabilities are partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are included as a component of other income (loss) net in our consolidated financial statements. Refer to the heading "Operations Review Other Income (Loss) Net." The Company recorded foreign currency losses of $148 million and $34 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company recorded a foreign currency gain of $24 million in 2008. The remeasurement loss recorded in 2010 was primarily related to our Venezuelan subsidiary. Subsequent to December 31, 2009, the Venezuelan government announced a currency devaluation, and Venezuela was determined to be a hyperinflationary economy. As a result, our local subsidiary was required to use the U.S. dollar as its functional currency and we recorded a net remeasurement loss of approximately $103 million during the first quarter of 2010, in the line item other income (loss) net in our consolidated statement of income. The Company will continue to manage its foreign currency exposure to mitigate, over time, a portion of the impact of exchange rate changes on net income and earnings per share. 82  Overview of Financial Position In 2010, the Company had a number of significant transactions and events that impacted our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to the heading "Operations Review Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements," for additional information related to these transactions and events. The most significant impact on our consolidated balance sheet was related to our acquisition of CCEs North American business, which resulted in the Company recording total assets of approximately $22.2 billion as of the acquisition date. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a preliminary allocation of the purchase price by major class of assets and liabilities. The majority of the fluctuations in individual line items in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2010, compared to our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2009, were attributable to this acquisition. The following table illustrates the change in the individual line items of the Companys consolidated balance sheet (in millions): December 31, 2010 2009 Change Cash and cash equivalents $ 8,517 $ 7,021 $ 1,496 Short term investments 2,682 2,130 552 Marketable securities 138 62 76 Trade accounts receivable net 4,430 3,758 672 Inventories 2,650 2,354 296 Prepaid expenses and other assets 3,162 2,226 936 Equity method investments 6,954 6,217 737 Other investments, principally bottling companies 631 538 93 Other assets 2,121 1,976 145 Property, plant and equipment net 14,727 9,561 5,166 Trademarks with indefinite lives 6,356 6,183 173 Bottlers franchise rights with indefinite lives 7,511 1,953 5,558 Goodwill 11,665 4,224 7,441 Other intangible assets 1,377 468 909 Total assets $ 72,921 $ 48,671 $ 24,250 Accounts payable and accrued expenses $ 8,859 $ 6,657 $ 2,202 Loans and notes payable 8,100 6,749 1,351 Current maturities of long term debt 1,276 51 1,225 Accrued income taxes 273 264 9 Long term debt 14,041 5,059 8,982 Other liabilities 4,794 2,965 1,829 Deferred income taxes 4,261 1,580 2,681 Total liabilities 41,604 23,325 18,279 Net assets $ 31,317 $ 25,346 $ 5,971 1 1 Includes a decrease in net assets of $947 million resulting from translation adjustments in various balance sheet accounts. The table above includes the impact of the following transactions and events: Property, plant and equipment net increased $5,166 million, primarily due to the $5,385 million of property, plant and equipment acquired in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business. The impact of this acquisition was partially offset by a decrease of $315 million due to the disposal of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations and a decrease of $400 million related to the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of our adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. Refer to Note 1 and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Bottlers franchise rights with indefinite lives increased $5,558 million, primarily due to the $5,100 million of indefinite lived franchise rights we reacquired in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business and $865 million related to DPS license agreements. The impact of the previously mentioned items was partially offset by the impact of the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of our adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. Goodwill increased $7,441 million, primarily due to $7,746 million of goodwill recognized in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business. The acquired goodwill was partially offset by the impact of the 83 deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of our adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB and the disposal of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations. Refer to Note 1 and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other intangible assets increased $909 million, primarily due to $605 million of definite lived franchise rights and $380 million of customer rights we acquired in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased $2,202 million, primarily due to the $1,826 million of accounts payable and accrued expenses assumed in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase also reflects additional accrued liabilities related to our stock repurchase program for shares purchased but not settled as of December 31, 2010. Loans and notes payable increased $1,351 million, primarily related to an increase in short term borrowings to fund the cash payment made in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Current maturities of long term debt increased $1,225 million, primarily related to an increase in our overall debt balance as a result of our acquisition of CCEs North American business. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Long term debt increased $8,982 million, primarily due to long term debt assumed in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business. Refer to the heading "Cash Flows from Financing Activities," above, and Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other liabilities increased $1,829 million, primarily due to pension and other postretirement liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business. The assumed liabilities consisted of benefit obligations of $3,544 million and plan assets of $2,231 million as of the acquisition date. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to pension and other postretirement plans assumed from CCE. Deferred income taxes increased $2,681 million, primarily due to deferred tax liabilities recorded on the franchise rights acquired in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices Inflation affects the way we operate in many markets around the world. In general, we believe that, over time, we are able to increase prices to counteract the majority of the inflationary effects of increasing costs and to generate sufficient cash flows to maintain our productive capability. 84   ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and other market risks. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. As a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure. Because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure, fluctuations in the value of the instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure. The Company generally hedges anticipated exposures up to 36 months in advance; however, the majority of our derivative instruments expire within 24 months or less. Virtually all of our derivatives are straightforward over the counter instruments with liquid markets. We monitor our exposure to financial market risks using several objective measurement systems. In prior years, the Company primarily used the value at risk methodology for its quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. However, with the Companys acquisition of CCEs North American business in 2010, and the related changes to our consolidated balance sheet, the Company has provided a sensitivity analysis to measure our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and commodity prices. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our hedging transactions and derivative financial instruments. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates We manage most of our foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows us to net certain exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets. In 2010, we generated approximately 70 percent of our net operating revenues from operations outside the United States; therefore, weakness in one particular currency might be offset by strengths in other currencies over time. We use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to currency fluctuations. Our Company enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases currency options (principally euro and Japanese yen) and collars to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. Additionally, we enter into forward exchange contracts to offset the earnings impact related to exchange rate fluctuations on certain monetary assets and liabilities. We also enter into forward exchange contracts as hedges of net investments in international operations. The total notional value of our foreign currency derivatives was $6.3 billion and $4.6 billion as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. This total includes derivative instruments that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting as well as economic hedges. The fair value of the contracts that qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a liability of $109 million as of December 31, 2010. At the end of 2010, we estimate that an unfavorable 10 percent change in the exchange rates would have increased our net unrealized losses by $395 million. Likewise, the fair value of the contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a liability of $79 million, and we estimate that an unfavorable 10 percent change in rates would have increased our net losses by $244 million. All losses were offset by changes in the underlying hedged item, resulting in no net material impact on earnings. Interest Rates We monitor our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt, as well as our mix of short term debt versus long term debt. From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt. Based on the Companys variable rate debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2010, a 1 percentage point increase versus the market interest rates available on December 31, 2010 would result in an additional $123 million of interest expense. However, the impact to our consolidated statement of income would have been partially offset by the increase in interest income related to higher interest rates. Commodity Prices The Company is subject to market risk with respect to commodity price fluctuations, principally related to our purchases of aluminum and plastic, sweeteners, and energy. Whenever possible, we manage our exposure to commodity risks primarily through the use of supplier pricing agreements that enable us to establish the purchase prices for certain inputs that are used in our manufacturing and distribution business. We also use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to commodity risks at times. Certain of these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, but 85 they are effective economic hedges that help the Company mitigate the price risk associated with the purchases of materials used in our manufacturing processes and the fuel used to operate our extensive vehicle fleet. Open commodity derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting had a notional value of $28 million as of December 31, 2010. These contracts had a fair value of $2 million. The potential change in fair value of these commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10 percent decrease in underlying commodity prices, would have eliminated the net unrealized gain and created an unrealized loss of $2 million. Open commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting had a notional value of $425 million as of December 31, 2010. These contracts had a fair value of $56 million. The potential change in fair value of these commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10 percent decrease in underlying commodity prices, would have reduced our net gain by $31 million. 86

We own or license and market more than 500 nonalcoholic beverage brands, primarily sparkling beverages but also a variety of still beverages such as waters, enhanced waters, juices and juice drinks, ready to drink teas and coffees, and energy and sports drinks. Along with Coca Cola, which is recognized as the worlds most valuable brand, we own and market four of the worlds top five nonalcoholic sparkling beverage brands, including Diet Coke, Fanta and Sprite. Finished beverage products bearing our trademarks, sold in the United States since 1886, are now sold in more than 200 countries. We make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of Company owned or controlled bottling and distribution operations, bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers the worlds largest beverage distribution system. Of the approximately 55 billion beverage servings of all types consumed worldwide every day, beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us account for approximately 1.7 billion. We believe that our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide variety of choices to meet their desires, needs and lifestyle choices. Our success further depends on the ability of our people to execute effectively, every day. Our goal is to use our Companys assets our brands, financial strength, unrivaled distribution system, global reach and the talent and strong commitment of our management and associates to become more competitive and to accelerate growth in a manner that creates value for our shareowners. Our Company markets, manufactures and sells: beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as "beverage bases," and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our "concentrate business" or "concentrate operations"); and finished sparkling and still beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our "finished products business" or "finished products operations"). Generally, finished products operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations. In our concentrate operations, we typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to authorized bottling and canning operations (to which we typically refer as our "bottlers" or our "bottling partners"). Our bottling partners either combine the concentrates with sweeteners (depending on the product), still water and or sparkling water or combine the syrups with sparkling water to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us such as cans and refillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through wholesalers or other bottlers. Outside the United States, we also sell concentrates for fountain beverages to our bottling partners who are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, which they sell to fountain retailers such as restaurants and convenience stores which use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. Our finished products operations consist primarily of the production, sales and distribution operations managed by CCR and our Company owned or controlled bottling and distribution operations. CCR is included in our North America operating segment, and our Company owned or controlled bottling and distribution operations are included in our Bottling Investments operating segment. Our finished products operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling beverages and a variety of still beverages, such as juices and juice drinks, energy and sports drinks, ready to drink teas and coffees, and certain water products, to retailers or to distributors, wholesalers and bottling partners who distribute them to retailers. In addition, in the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers such as restaurants and convenience stores who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. In the United States, we authorize wholesalers to resell our fountain syrups through nonexclusive appointments that neither restrict us in setting the prices at which we sell fountain syrups to the wholesalers nor restrict the territories in which the wholesalers may resell in the United States. 34 The following table sets forth the percentage of total net operating revenues related to concentrate operations and finished products operations, respectively: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Concentrate operations1 51 % 54 % 54 % Finished products operations2 49 3 46 46 Net operating revenues 100 % 100 % 100 % 1 Includes concentrates sold by the Company to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of fountain syrups.

Acquisition of CCEs North American Business and Related Transactions Pursuant to the terms of the business separation and merger agreement entered into on February 25, 2010, as amended (the "merger agreement"), on October 2, 2010 (the "acquisition date"), we acquired CCEs North American business, consisting of CCEs production, sales and distribution operations in the United States, Canada, the British Virgin Islands, the United States Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands, and a substantial majority of CCEs corporate segment. We believe this acquisition will result in an evolved franchise system that will enable us to better serve the unique needs of the North American market. The creation of a unified operating system will strategically position us to better market and distribute our nonalcoholic beverage brands in North America. Under the terms of the merger agreement, the Company acquired the 67 percent of CCEs North American business that was not already owned by the Company for consideration that included: (1) the Companys 33 percent indirect ownership interest in CCEs European operations; (2) cash consideration; and (3) replacement awards issued to certain current and former employees of CCEs North American and corporate operations. At closing, CCE shareowners other than the Company exchanged their CCE common stock for common stock in a new entity, which was renamed Coca Cola Enterprises, Inc. (which is referred to herein as "New CCE") and which continues to hold the European operations held by CCE prior to the acquisition. At closing, New CCE became 100 percent owned by shareowners that held shares of common stock of CCE immediately prior to the closing, other than the Company. As a result of this transaction, the Company does not own any interest in New CCE. As of October 1, 2010, our Company owned approximately 33 percent of the outstanding common stock of CCE. Based on the closing price of CCEs common stock on the last day of trading prior to the acquisition date, the fair value of our investment in CCE was approximately $5,373 million, which reflected the fair value of our ownership in both CCEs North American business and its European operations. We remeasured our equity interest in CCE to fair value upon 35 the close of the transaction. As a result, we recognized a gain of approximately $4,978 million, which was classified in the line item other income (loss) net in our consolidated statement of income. The gain included a $137 million reclassification adjustment related to foreign currency translation gains recognized upon the disposal of our indirect investment in CCEs European operations. The Company relinquished its indirect ownership interest in CCEs European operations to New CCE as part of the consideration to acquire the 67 percent of CCEs North American business that was not already owned by the Company. Although the CCE transaction was structured to be primarily cashless, under the terms of the merger agreement, we agreed to assume approximately $8.9 billion of CCE debt. In the event that the actual CCE debt on the acquisition date was less than the agreed amount, we agreed to make a cash payment to New CCE for the difference. As of the acquisition date, the debt assumed by the Company was approximately $7.9 billion. The total cash consideration paid to New CCE as part of the transaction was approximately $1.3 billion, which included approximately $1.0 billion related to the debt shortfall. In contemplation of the closing of our acquisition of CCEs North American business, we reached an agreement with DPS to distribute certain DPS brands in territories where DPS brands had been distributed by CCE prior to the CCE transaction. Under the terms of our agreement with DPS, concurrently with the closing of the CCE transaction, we entered into license agreements with DPS to distribute Dr Pepper trademark brands in the U.S., Canada Dry in the Northeast U.S., and Canada Dry and C Plus in Canada, and we made a net one time cash payment of $715 million to DPS. Under the license agreements, the Company agreed to meet certain performance obligations to distribute DPS products in retail and foodservice accounts and vending machines. The license agreements have initial terms of 20 years, with automatic 20 year renewal periods unless otherwise terminated under the terms of the agreements. The license agreements replaced agreements between DPS and CCE existing immediately prior to the completion of the CCE transaction. In addition, we entered into an agreement with DPS to include Dr Pepper and Diet Dr Pepper in our Coca Cola Freestyle fountain dispensers in certain outlets throughout the United States. The Coca Cola Freestyle agreement has a term of 20 years. On October 2, 2010, we sold all of our ownership interests in our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE for approximately $0.9 billion in cash. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of CCEs North American business, we granted to New CCE the right to acquire our majority interest in our German bottler at any time from 18 to 39 months after February 25, 2010, at the then current fair value and subject to terms and conditions as mutually agreed. The Nonalcoholic Beverages Segment of the Commercial Beverages Industry We operate in the highly competitive nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry. We face strong competition from numerous other general and specialty beverage companies. We, along with other beverage companies, are affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, cost to manufacture and distribute products, consumer spending, economic conditions, availability and quality of water, consumer preferences, inflation, political climate, local and national laws and regulations, foreign currency exchange fluctuations, fuel prices and weather patterns. Our Objective Our objective is to use our formidable assets brands, financial strength, unrivaled distribution system, global reach, and a strong commitment by our management and associates worldwide to achieve long term sustainable growth. Our vision for sustainable growth includes the following: People: Being a great place to work where people are inspired to be the best they can be. Portfolio: Bringing to the world a portfolio of beverage brands that anticipates and satisfies peoples desires and needs. Partners: Nurturing a winning network of partners and building mutual loyalty. Planet: Being a responsible global citizen that makes a difference. Profit: Maximizing return to shareowners while being mindful of our overall responsibilities. Productivity: Managing our people, time and money for greatest effectiveness. 36 Strategic Priorities We have four strategic priorities designed to create long term sustainable growth for our Company and the Coca Cola system and value for our shareowners. These strategic priorities are driving global beverage leadership; accelerating innovation; leveraging our balanced geographic portfolio; and leading the Coca Cola system for growth. To enable the entire Coca Cola system so that we can deliver on these strategic priorities, we must further enhance our core capabilities of consumer marketing; commercial leadership; franchise leadership; and bottling and distribution operations. Core Capabilities Consumer Marketing Marketing investments are designed to enhance consumer awareness of and increase consumer preference for our brands. This produces long term growth in unit case volume, per capita consumption and our share of worldwide nonalcoholic beverage sales. Through our relationships with our bottling partners and those who sell our products in the marketplace, we create and implement integrated marketing programs, both globally and locally, that are designed to heighten consumer awareness of and product appeal for our brands. In developing a strategy for a Company brand, we conduct product and packaging research, establish brand positioning, develop precise consumer communications and solicit consumer feedback. Our integrated marketing activities include, but are not limited to, advertising, point of sale merchandising and sales promotions. We have disciplined marketing strategies that focus on driving volume in emerging markets, increasing our brand value in developing markets and growing profit in our most developed markets. In emerging markets, we are investing in infrastructure programs that drive volume through increased access to consumers. In developing markets, where consumer access has largely been established, our focus is on differentiating our brands. In our most developed markets, we continue to invest in brands and infrastructure programs, but at a slower rate than revenue growth. We are focused on affordability and ensuring we are communicating the appropriate message based on the current economic environment. Commercial Leadership The Coca Cola system has millions of customers around the world who sell or serve our products directly to consumers. We focus on enhancing value for our customers and providing solutions to grow their beverage businesses. Our approach includes understanding each customers business and needs, whether that customer is a sophisticated retailer in a developed market or a kiosk owner in an emerging market. We focus on ensuring that our customers have the right product and package offerings and the right promotional tools to deliver enhanced value to themselves and the Company. We are constantly looking to build new beverage consumption occasions in our customers outlets through unique and innovative consumer experiences, product availability and delivery systems, and beverage merchandising and displays. We participate in joint brand building initiatives with our customers in order to drive customer preference for our brands. Through our commercial leadership initiatives, we embed ourselves further into our retail customers businesses while developing strategies for better execution at the point of sale. Franchise Leadership We must continue to improve our franchise leadership capabilities to give our Company and our bottling partners the ability to grow together through shared values, aligned incentives and a sense of urgency and flexibility that supports consumers always changing needs and tastes. The financial health and success of our bottling partners are critical components of the Companys success. We work with our bottling partners to identify system requirements that enable us to quickly achieve scale and efficiencies, and we share best practices throughout the bottling system. Our system leadership allows us to leverage recent acquisitions to expand our volume base and enhance margins. With our bottling partners, we work to produce differentiated beverages and packages that are appropriate for the right channels and consumers. We also design business models for sparkling and still beverages in specific markets to ensure that we appropriately share the value created by these beverages with our bottling partners. We will continue to build a supply chain network that leverages the size and scale of the Coca Cola system to gain a competitive advantage. 37 Bottling and Distribution Operations While most of our Company beverage products are manufactured, sold and distributed by independently owned and managed bottling partners, the Company has had a significant increase in the number of consolidated bottling and distribution operations over the last several years. We often acquire bottlers in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance. Owning such a controlling interest enables us to compensate for limited local resources; help focus the bottlers sales and marketing programs; assist in the development of the bottlers business and information systems; and establish an appropriate capital structure for the bottler. As a Company we have a long history of providing world class customer service, demonstrating leadership in the marketplace and leveraging the talent of our global workforce. In addition, we have an experienced bottler management team. All of these factors are critical to build upon as we manage our growing bottling and distribution operations. The Company has a deep commitment to continuously improving our business. This includes our efforts to develop innovative packaging and merchandising solutions which help drive demand for our beverages and meet the growing needs of our consumers. As we further transform the way we go to market the Company continues to seek out ways to be more efficient. Challenges and Risks Being a global company provides unique opportunities for our Company. Challenges and risks accompany those opportunities. Our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of the nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry and our Company. Of these, four key challenges and risks are discussed below. Obesity and Inactive Lifestyles. Increasing concern among consumers, public health professionals and government agencies of the potential health problems associated with obesity and inactive lifestyles represents a significant challenge to our industry. We recognize that obesity is a complex public health problem. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line, which includes a wide selection of diet and light beverages, juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and water products. Our commitment also includes adhering to responsible policies in schools and in the marketplace; supporting programs to encourage physical activity and promote nutrition education; and continuously meeting changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. We are committed to playing an appropriate role in helping address this issue in cooperation with governments, educators and consumers through science based solutions and programs. Water Quality and Quantity. Water quality and quantity is an issue that increasingly requires our Companys attention and collaboration with the nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry, governments, nongovernmental organizations and communities where we operate. Water is the main ingredient in substantially all of our products. It is also a limited natural resource facing unprecedented challenges from overexploitation, increasing pollution and poor management. Our Company is in an excellent position to share the water related knowledge we have developed in the communities we serve water resource management, water treatment, wastewater treatment systems, and models for working with communities and partners in addressing water and sanitation needs. We are actively engaged in assessing the specific water related risks that we and many of our bottling partners face and have implemented a formal water risk management program. We are working with our global partners to develop water sustainability projects. We are actively encouraging improved water efficiency and conservation efforts throughout our system. As demand for water continues to increase around the world, we expect commitment and continued action on our part will be crucial in the successful long term stewardship of this critical natural resource. Evolving Consumer Preferences. Consumers want more choices. We are impacted by shifting consumer demographics and needs, on the go lifestyles, aging populations in developed markets and consumers who are empowered with more information than ever. We are committed to generating new avenues for growth through our core brands with a focus on diet and light products. We are also committed to continuing to expand the variety of choices we provide to consumers to meet their needs, desires and lifestyle choices. 38 Increased Competition and Capabilities in the Marketplace. Our Company is facing strong competition from some well established global companies and many local participants. We must continue to selectively expand into other profitable segments of the nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry and strengthen our capabilities in marketing and innovation in order to maintain our brand loyalty and market share. All four of these challenges and risks obesity and inactive lifestyles, water quality and quantity, evolving consumer preferences, and increased competition and capabilities in the marketplace have the potential to have a material adverse effect on the nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry and on our Company; however, we believe our Company is well positioned to appropriately address these challenges and risks. See also "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in Part I of this report for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following: Basis of Presentation Principles of Consolidation Purchase Accounting for Acquisitions Recoverability of Noncurrent Assets Pension Plan Valuations Revenue Recognition Income Taxes Contingencies Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Companys Board of Directors. While our estimates and assumptions are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions. For a discussion of the Companys significant accounting policies, refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Basis of Presentation Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from estimates and assumptions. Furthermore, when testing assets for impairment in future periods, if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur, impairment charges may result. We use the equity method to account for investments in companies if our investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the investee. Our consolidated net income includes our Companys proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies. The carrying values of our equity method investments are increased or decreased by our proportionate share of the net income or loss and other comprehensive income (loss) ("OCI") of these companies. The carrying values of our equity method investments are also decreased by dividends we receive from the investees. Our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy making decisions and material intercompany transactions. 39  We eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions, including the intercompany transactions with consolidated VIEs and the intercompany portion of transactions with equity method investees. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States provide entities the option to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value, with the change in fair value being included in the determination of net income. The Company has currently chosen not to elect the fair value option; and therefore, we only measure assets and liabilities at fair value if required under other accounting guidance. Certain amounts in the prior years consolidated financial statements and notes have been revised to conform to the current year presentation. Principles of Consolidation Our Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest as well as VIEs for which our Company is the primary beneficiary. Generally, we consolidate only business enterprises that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest. However, there are situations in which consolidation is required even though the usual condition of consolidation (ownership of a majority voting interest) does not apply. Generally, this occurs when an entity holds an interest in another business enterprise that was achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship between such entitys voting interests in, and its exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of, the other business enterprise. This disproportionate relationship results in what is known as a variable interest, and the entity in which we have the variable interest is referred to as a VIE. An enterprise must consolidate a VIE if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary has both (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance, and (b) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Our Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling and container manufacturing operations, for which we were not determined to be the primary beneficiary. Our variable interests in these VIEs primarily relate to profit guarantees or subordinated financial support. Refer to Note 11. Although these financial arrangements resulted in us holding variable interests in these entities, the majority of these arrangements did not empower us to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance. Our Companys investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs totaled approximately $1,274 million and $624 million as of December 31, 2010, and 2009, respectively, representing our maximum exposures to loss. The Companys investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs were not significant to the Companys consolidated financial statements. In addition, our Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling and container manufacturing operations, for which we were determined to be the primary beneficiary. Our Companys investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs totaled approximately $191 million and $84 million as of December 31, 2010, and 2009, respectively, representing our maximum exposures to loss. The assets and liabilities of VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary were not significant to the Companys consolidated financial statements. Creditors of our VIEs do not have recourse against the general credit of the Company, regardless of whether they are accounted for as consolidated entities. The information presented above reflects the impact of the Companys adoption of accounting guidance issued by the FASB related to VIEs in June 2009. This accounting guidance resulted in a change in our accounting policy effective January 1, 2010. Among other things, the guidance requires more qualitative than quantitative analyses to determine the primary beneficiary of a VIE, requires continuous assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, enhances disclosures about an enterprises involvement with a VIE, and amends certain guidance for determining whether an entity is a VIE. Beginning January 1, 2010, we deconsolidated certain entities as a result of this change in accounting policy. These entities are primarily bottling operations and had previously been consolidated due to certain loan guarantees and or other financial support given by the Company. These financial arrangements, although not significant to our consolidated financial statements, resulted in a disproportionate relationship between our voting interests in these entities and our exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of the entities. As a result, we determined that we held a majority of the variable interests in these entities and, therefore, were deemed to be the primary beneficiary 40 in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States as of December 31, 2009. Although these financial arrangements resulted in us holding a majority of the variable interests in these VIEs, the majority of these arrangements did not empower us to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance. Consequently, subsequent to the change in accounting policy, the Company deconsolidated the majority of these VIEs. The entities that have been deconsolidated accounted for less than 1 percent of net income attributable to shareowners of The Coca Cola Company in 2009, and we have accounted for these entities under the equity method of accounting since January 1, 2010. Although the deconsolidation of these entities impacted individual line items in our consolidated financial statements, the impact on net income attributable to shareowners of The Coca Cola Company in future periods will be nominal. The equity method of accounting is intended to be a single line consolidation and, therefore, generally should result in the same net income attributable to the investor as would be the case if the investee had been consolidated. The main impact on our consolidated financial statements in 2010 was that, instead of these entities results of operations and balance sheets affecting our consolidated line items, our proportionate share of net income or loss from these entities was reported in equity income (loss) net, in our consolidated income statements, and our investment in these entities was reported as equity method investments in our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to the heading "Structural Changes and New License Agreements" for additional information. Purchase Accounting for Acquisitions The Company adopted new guidance issued by the FASB on January 1, 2009, which changed the application of the acquisition method of accounting in a business combination and also modified the way assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized on a prospective basis. In general, the acquisition method of accounting requires companies to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition. We estimate fair value using the exit price approach which is defined as the price that would be received if we sold an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly market. The value of an exit price is determined from the viewpoint of all market participants as a whole and may result in the Company valuing assets at a fair value that is not reflective of our intended use of the assets. Any amount of the purchase price paid that is in excess of the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded in the line item goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets. Managements judgment is used to determine the estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives for property, plant and equipment and amortization periods for intangible assets, and can materially affect the Companys results of operations. Transaction costs, as well as costs to reorganize acquired companies, are expensed as incurred in the Companys consolidated statements of income. In 2010, we acquired CCEs North American business and recorded total assets of approximately $22.2 billion as of the acquisition date. The assets we acquired included a material amount of intangible assets that are subject to the significant estimates described above. Our acquisition accounting is not complete and adjustments may be recorded in future periods as appraisals for intangible assets and certain fixed assets are completed. Refer to the heading "Recoverability of Noncurrent Assets," below, and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to this acquisition. Recoverability of Noncurrent Assets We perform recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. For certain assets, recoverability and or impairment tests are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For other assets, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently, if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. Our equity method investees also perform such recoverability and or impairment tests. If an impairment charge was recorded by one of our equity method investees, the Company would record its proportionate share of such charge as a reduction of equity income (loss) net in our consolidated income statements. However, the actual amount we record with respect to our proportionate share of such charges may be impacted by items such as basis differences, deferred taxes and deferred gains. 41 Managements assessments of the recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets involve critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management judgment, include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management must estimate include, among others, the economic life of the asset, sales volume, prices, inflation, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates and capital spending. These factors are even more difficult to predict when global financial markets are highly volatile. The estimates we use when assessing the recoverability of noncurrent assets are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. When performing impairment tests, we estimate the fair values of the assets using managements best assumptions, which we believe would be consistent with what a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. Estimates and assumptions used in these tests are evaluated and updated as appropriate. The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. If other assumptions and estimates had been used when these tests were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. As mentioned above, these factors do not change in isolation; and therefore, we do not believe it is practicable to present the impact of changing a single factor. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future periods, future impairment charges could result. Our Company faces many uncertainties and risks related to various economic, political and regulatory environments in the countries in which we operate, particularly in developing or emerging markets. Refer to the heading "Our Business Challenges and Risks," above, and "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in Part I of this report. As a result, management must make numerous assumptions which involve a significant amount of judgment when completing recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets in various regions around the world. Investments in Equity and Debt Securities The carrying values of our investments in equity securities are determined using the equity method, the cost method or the fair value method. Refer to the heading "Basis of Presentation," above, for information related to how the carrying values of our equity method investments are determined. We account for investments in companies that we do not control or account for under the equity method either at fair value or under the cost method, as applicable. Investments in equity securities are carried at fair value, if the fair value of the security is readily determinable. Equity investments carried at fair value are classified as either trading or available for sale securities. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities and realized gains and losses on available for sale securities are included in net income. Unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, on available for sale securities are included in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI"). Trading securities are reported as either marketable securities or other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Securities classified as available for sale are reported as either marketable securities or other investments in our consolidated balance sheets, depending on the length of time we intend to hold the investment. Investments in equity securities that do not qualify for fair value accounting are accounted for under the cost method. In accordance with the cost method, our initial investment is recorded at cost and we record dividend income when applicable dividends are declared. Cost method investments are reported as other investments in our consolidated balance sheets. Our investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. Investments in debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held to maturity. Investments in debt securities that are not classified as held to maturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available for sale. The following table presents the carrying values of our investments in equity and debt securities (in millions): December 31, 2010 Carrying Value Percentage of Total Assets Equity method investments $ 6,954 10 % Securities classified as available for sale 485 * Securities classified as trading 209 * Cost method investments 159 * Securities classified as held to maturity 111 * Total $ 7,918 11 % * Accounts for less than 1 percent of the Companys total assets. 42 Investments classified as trading securities are not assessed for impairment, since they are carried at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. We review our investments in equity and debt securities that are accounted for using the equity method or cost method or that are classified as available for sale or held to maturity each reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment. When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to our cost basis in the investment. We also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which our cost basis has exceeded the fair value in the prior period. The fair values of most of our Companys investments in publicly traded companies are often readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded companies, managements assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds and appraisals, as appropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or estimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in developing and emerging markets, may impact the determination of fair value. In the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. If management determines the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Managements assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is based on, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis, the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, and our intent and ability to retain the investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. As of December 31, 2010, unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities were approximately $267 million and $5 million, respectively. Management assessed each individual investment with unrealized losses to determine if the decline in fair value was other than temporary. Based on these assessments, management determined that the decline in fair value of each of these investments was temporary in nature. We will continue to monitor these investments in future periods. Refer to Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2010, the Company recognized other than temporary impairments of $41 million related to certain available for sale securities and an equity method investment. These impairment charges were recorded in other income (loss) net and impacted the Bottling Investments and Corporate operating segments. Refer to Note 16 and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2009, the Company recorded a charge of approximately $27 million in other income (loss) net as a result of an other than temporary decline in the fair value of a cost method investment. As of December 31, 2008, the estimated fair value of this investment approximated the Companys carrying value in the investment. However, in 2009, the Company was informed by the investee of its intent to reorganize its capital structure in 2009, which resulted in the Companys shares in the investee being canceled. As a result, the Company determined that the decline in fair value of this cost method investment was other than temporary. This impairment charge impacted the Corporate operating segment. Refer to Note 16 and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had several investments classified as available for sale securities in which our cost basis exceeded the fair value of the investment, each of which initially occurred between the end of the second quarter and the beginning of the third quarter of 2008. Management determined that the decline in fair value of each investment was other than temporary, and the Company recognized impairment charges of approximately $81 million during the fourth quarter of 2008. These impairment charges were recorded to other income (loss) net in the consolidated statement of income. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 43 The following table presents the difference between calculated fair values, based on quoted closing prices of publicly traded shares, and our Companys cost basis in publicly traded bottlers accounted for as equity method investments (in millions): December 31, 2010 Fair Value Carrying Value Difference Coca Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. $ 4,740 $ 1,315 $ 3,425 Coca Cola Amatil Limited 2,322 948 1,374 Coca Cola Hellenic Bottling Company S.A. 2,204 1,336 868 Coca Cola Icecek A.S. 692 183 509 Coca Cola Embonor S.A. 480 284 196 Grupo Continental, S.A.B. 439 175 264 Embotelladoras Coca Cola Polar S.A. 160 96 64 Coca Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated 138 83 55 $ 11,175 $ 4,420 $ 6,755 Other Assets Our Company invests in infrastructure programs with our bottlers that are directed at strengthening our bottling system and increasing unit case volume. Additionally, our Company advances payments to certain customers to fund future marketing activities intended to generate profitable volume and expenses such payments over the periods benefited. Advance payments are also made to certain customers for distribution rights. Payments under these programs are generally capitalized and reported in the line items prepaid expenses and other assets or other assets, as appropriate, in our consolidated balance sheets. When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. In 2010, as a result of our acquisition of CCEs North American business, the Company recorded a charge of $265 million related to preexisting relationships. The charge was primarily related to the write off of our investment in infrastructure programs with CCE. Our investment in these infrastructure programs with CCE did not meet the criteria to be recognized as an asset subsequent to the acquisition. Refer to Note 2 and Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Property, Plant and Equipment As of December 31, 2010, the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment, net of depreciation, was approximately $14,727 million, or 20 percent of our total assets. Certain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment should be assessed, including, among others, a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in the business climate in a particular market, or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses or projected future losses. When such events or changes in circumstances are present, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset (or asset group) and its eventual disposition. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of property, plant and equipment, including appraisals and discounted cash flow models, which are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use. 44  Goodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets Intangible assets are classified into one of three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill. For intangible assets with definite lives, tests for impairment must be performed if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill, tests for impairment must be performed at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. The following table presents the carrying values of intangible assets included in our consolidated balance sheet (in millions): December 31, 2010 Carrying Value Percentage of Total Assets Goodwill $ 11,665 16 % Bottlers franchise rights with indefinite lives 7,511 10 Trademarks with indefinite lives 6,356 9 Definite lived intangible assets, net 1,264 2 Other intangible assets not subject to amortization 113 * Total $ 26,909 37 % * Accounts for less than 1 percent of the Companys total assets. When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of definite lived intangible assets may not be recoverable, management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of these assets, including discounted cash flow models, which are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use. We test intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, including trademarks, franchise rights and goodwill, for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. Our Company performs these annual impairment reviews as of the first day of our third fiscal quarter. We use a variety of methodologies in conducting impairment assessments of indefinite lived intangible assets, including, but not limited to, discounted cash flow models, which are based on the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use. For indefinite lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segments. Our operating segments are primarily based on geographic responsibility, which is consistent with the way management runs our business. Our operating segments are subdivided into smaller geographic regions or territories that we sometimes refer to as business units. These business units are also our reporting units. The Bottling Investments operating segment includes all Company owned or consolidated bottling operations, regardless of geographic location, except for bottling operations managed by CCR, which are included in our North America operating segment. Generally, each Company owned or consolidated bottling operation within our Bottling Investments operating segment is its own reporting unit. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination. In 2010, the Company combined several reporting units within our Europe operating segment. In addition, we also combined several reporting units within our Pacific operating segment. These changes were the result of the Companys productivity initiatives. The goodwill impairment test consists of a two step process, if necessary. The first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. We typically use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. The assumptions used in these models are consistent with those we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the second step of the impairment test must be performed in order to determine the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the 45 carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. Intangible assets acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, primarily due to the fact that they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and macroeconomic conditions present at the time of acquisition. Consequently, if operating results and or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate shortly after an acquisition, it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets. A deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models, but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the estimated cost of capital and or discount rates. Additionally, as discussed above, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. As a result, the cost of capital and or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends, regardless of whether our Companys actual cost of capital has changed. Therefore, if the cost of capital and or discount rates change, our Company may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset or assets in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to, or greater than, our previously forecasted amounts. As of our most recent annual impairment review, the Company had no significant impairments of its intangible assets, individually or in the aggregate. In addition, as of December 31, 2010, we did not have any reporting units with a material amount of goodwill for which it is reasonably likely that they will fail step one of a goodwill impairment test in the near term. However, if macroeconomic conditions worsen, it is possible that we may experience significant impairments of some of our intangible assets, which would require us to recognize impairment charges. Management will continue to monitor the fair value of our intangible assets in future periods. In 2010, we acquired CCEs North American business, which resulted in the Company recording $13,878 million of intangible assets, including goodwill. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The acquired intangible assets included $5,705 million of bottler franchise rights, which consisted of $5,100 million of franchise rights with indefinite lives and $605 million of franchise rights with definite lives. The franchise rights with indefinite lives represent franchise rights that had previously provided CCE with exclusive and perpetual rights to manufacture and or distribute certain beverages in specified territories. The franchise rights with definite lives relate to franchise rights that had previously provided CCE with exclusive rights to manufacture and or distribute certain beverages in specified territories for a finite period of time and, therefore, have been classified as definite lived intangible assets. The bottler franchise rights acquired by the Company in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business include the contractual rights previously impaired by CCE. In 2008, CCE recorded pretax impairment charges of approximately $7.6 billion ($4.9 billion after tax), which reduced the carrying value of CCEs North American franchise rights to zero. The decline in the estimated fair value of CCEs North American franchise rights was the result of several factors including, but not limited to, (1) challenging macroeconomic conditions which contributed to lower than anticipated volume for higher margin packages and certain higher margin beverage categories; (2) increases in raw material costs including significant increases in aluminum, HFCS and resin; (3) increased delivery costs as a result of higher fuel costs; (4) a dramatic increase in market debt rates, which impacted the capital charge; and (5) a significant decline in the funded status of CCEs defined benefit pension plans. Similar factors may also potentially result in future impairments. In 2008, the Companys proportionate share of these impairment charges recorded by CCE was approximately $1.6 billion, which we recorded to equity income (loss) net. Refer to the heading "Operations Review Equity Income (Loss) Net" and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company recorded $7,746 million of goodwill in connection with this acquisition, which is not tax deductible and has been assigned to the North America operating segment. This goodwill is primarily related to synergistic value created from having a unified operating system that will strategically position us to better market and distribute our nonalcoholic beverage brands in North America. It also includes certain other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, such as an assembled workforce. In 2009, the Company recognized a $23 million impairment charge due to a change in the expected useful life of an intangible asset, which was previously determined to have an indefinite life. Refer to the heading "Operations Review Other Operating Charges," and Note 16 and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 46 Hyperinflationary Economies Our Company conducts business in more than 200 countries, some of which have been deemed to be hyperinflationary economies due to excessively high inflation rates in recent years. These economies create financial exposure to the Company. Venezuela was deemed to be a hyperinflationary economy subsequent to December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2009, two main exchange rate mechanisms existed in Venezuela. The first exchange rate mechanism is known as the official rate of exchange ("official rate"), which is set by the Venezuelan government. In order to utilize the official rate, entities must seek approval from the government operated Foreign Exchange Administration Board ("CADIVI"). As of December 31, 2009, the official rate set by the Venezuelan government was 2.15 bolivars per U.S. dollar. The second exchange rate mechanism was known as the parallel rate, which in some circumstances provided entities with a more liquid exchange through the use of a series of transactions via a broker. Subsequent to December 31, 2009, Venezuela was determined to be a hyperinflationary economy, and the Venezuelan government devalued the bolivar by resetting the official rate to 2.6 bolivars per U.S. dollar for essential goods and 4.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar for nonessential goods. In accordance with hyperinflationary accounting under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, our local subsidiary was required to use the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. As a result, we remeasured the net assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary using the official rate for nonessential goods of 4.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar. During the first quarter of 2010, we recorded a loss of approximately $103 million related to the remeasurement of our Venezuelan subsidiarys net assets. The loss was recorded in the line item other income (loss) net in our consolidated statement of income. We classified the impact of the remeasurement loss in the line item effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated statement of cash flows. In early June 2010, the Venezuelan government introduced a newly regulated foreign currency exchange system known as the Transaction System for Foreign Currency Denominated Securities ("SITME"). This new system, which is subject to annual limits, replaced the parallel market whereby entities domiciled in Venezuela are able to exchange their bolivar to U.S. dollars through authorized financial institutions (commercial banks, savings and lending institutions, etc.). In December 2010, the Venezuelan government announced that it was eliminating the official rate of 2.6 bolivars per U.S. dollar for essential goods. As a result, there are only two exchange rates available for remeasuring bolivar denominated transactions as of December 31, 2010, the official rate of 4.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar for nonessential goods and the SITME rate. As discussed above, the Company has remeasured the net assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary using the official rate for nonessential goods of 4.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar since January 1, 2010. Therefore, the elimination of the official rate for essential goods had no impact on the remeasurement of the net assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary. We continue to use the official exchange rate for nonessential goods to remeasure the financial statements of our Venezuelan subsidiary. If the official exchange rate devalues further, it would result in our Company recognizing additional foreign currency exchange losses in our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2010, our Venezuelan subsidiary held monetary assets of approximately $200 million. In addition to the foreign currency exchange exposure related to our Venezuelan subsidiarys net assets, we also sell concentrate to our bottling partner in Venezuela from outside the country. These sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Some of our concentrate sales were approved by the CADIVI to receive the official rate for essential goods of 2.6 bolivars per U.S. dollar prior to the elimination of the official rate for essential goods in December 2010. Prior to the elimination of the official rate for essential goods, our bottling partner in Venezuela was able to convert bolivars to U.S. dollars to settle our receivables related to sales approved by the CADIVI. Therefore, as of December 31, 2010, our receivable balance related to concentrate sales that had been approved by the CADIVI was not significant. If we are unable to utilize a government approved exchange rate mechanism for future concentrate sales to our bottling partner in Venezuela, the amount of receivables related to these sales will increase. In addition, we have certain intangible assets associated with products sold in Venezuela. If we are unable to utilize a government approved exchange rate mechanism for concentrate sales, or if the bolivar further devalues, it could result in the impairment of these intangible assets. As of December 31, 2010, the carrying value of our accounts receivable from our bottling partner in Venezuela and intangible assets associated with products sold in Venezuela was approximately $135 million. The revenues and cash flows associated with concentrate sales to our bottling partner in Venezuela in 2011 are not anticipated to be significant to the Companys consolidated financial statements. 47 Pension Plan Valuations Our Company sponsors and or contributes to pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans covering substantially all U.S. employees. We also sponsor nonqualified, unfunded defined benefit pension plans for certain associates and participate in multi employer pension plans in the United States. In addition, our Company and its subsidiaries have various pension plans and other forms of postretirement arrangements outside the United States. Management is required to make certain critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions used to determine our pension expense and related obligation. We believe the most critical assumptions are related to (1) the discount rate used to determine the present value of the liabilities and (2) the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. All of our actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually. Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension expense and related obligation. At each measurement date, we determine the discount rate by reference to rates of high quality, long term corporate bonds that mature in a pattern similar to the future payments we anticipate making under the plans. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the weighted average discount rate used to compute our benefit obligation was 5.5 percent and 5.75 percent, respectively. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based upon the long term outlook of our investment strategy as well as our historical returns and volatilities for each asset class. We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of our long term rates. Our pension plan investment objective is to ensure all our plans have sufficient funds to meet their benefit obligations when they become due. As a result, the Company periodically revises asset allocations, where appropriate, to improve returns and manage risk. The weighted average expected long term rate of return used to calculate our net periodic benefit cost was 8.0 percent in both 2010 and 2009. In 2010, the Companys total pension expense was $176 million. In 2011, we expect our total pension expense to be approximately $240 million. The expected increase is primarily due to the impact of our acquisition of CCEs North American business. The estimated impact of an additional 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate on our 2011 pension expense is an increase to our pension expense of approximately $21 million. Additionally, the estimated impact of a 50 basis point decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets on our 2011 pension expense is an increase to our pension expense of approximately $20 million. The sensitivity information provided above is based only on changes to the actuarial assumptions used for our U.S. pension plans. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our pension plans and related actuarial assumptions. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of products has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. For our Company, this generally means that we recognize revenue when title to our products is transferred to our bottling partners, resellers or other customers. Title usually transfers upon shipment to or receipt at our customers locations, as determined by the specific sales terms of each transaction. Our sales terms do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing defects on our part. Our customers can earn certain incentives, which are included in deductions from revenue, a component of net operating revenues in the consolidated statements of income. These incentives include, but are not limited to, cash discounts, funds for promotional and marketing activities, volume based incentive programs and support for infrastructure programs. Refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The aggregate deductions from revenue recorded by the Company in relation to these programs, including amortization expense on infrastructure programs, were approximately $5.0 billion, $4.5 billion and $4.4 billion in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In preparing the financial statements, management must make estimates related to the contractual terms, customer performance and sales volume to determine the total amounts recorded as deductions from revenue. Management also considers past results in making such estimates. The actual amounts ultimately paid may be different from our estimates. Such differences are recorded once they have been determined, and have historically not been significant. 48  Income Taxes Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain based upon one of the following: (1) the tax position is not "more likely than not" to be sustained, (2) the tax position is "more likely than not" to be sustained, but for a lesser amount, or (3) the tax position is "more likely than not" to be sustained, but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken. For purposes of evaluating whether or not a tax position is uncertain, (1) we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information, (2) the technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position, and (3) each tax position is evaluated without considerations of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax positions taken. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the "more likely than not" recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is "more likely than not" to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. Tax law requires items to be included in the tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements. As a result, the annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our tax return (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. The tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year and manner in which the differences are expected to reverse. Based on the evaluation of all available information, the Company recognizes future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not. We evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results, the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, taxable income in prior carryback years (if permitted) and the availability of tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is required to be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that the Company will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset. As of December 31, 2010, the Companys valuation allowances on deferred tax assets were $950 million and are primarily related to uncertainties regarding the future realization of recorded tax benefits on tax loss carryforwards generated in various jurisdictions. Current evidence does not suggest we will realize sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (e.g., capital gain versus ordinary income) within the carryforward period to allow us to realize these deferred tax benefits. If we were to identify and implement tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or generate sufficient income of the appropriate character in these jurisdictions in the future, it could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense. The Company believes that it will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets. The Company does not record a U.S. deferred tax liability for the excess of the book basis over the tax basis of its investments in foreign corporations to the extent that the basis difference results from earnings that meet the indefinite reversal criteria. This criteria is met if the foreign subsidiary has invested, or will invest, the undistributed earnings indefinitely. The decision as to the amount of undistributed earnings that the Company intends to maintain in non U.S. subsidiaries takes into account items including, but is not limited to, forecasts and budgets of financial needs of cash for working capital, liquidity plans, capital improvement programs, merger and acquisition plans, and planned loans to other non U.S. subsidiaries. The Company also evaluates its expected cash requirements in the United States. Other 49 factors that can influence that determination are local restrictions on remittances (for example, in some countries a central bank application and approval are required in order for the Companys local country subsidiary to pay a dividend), economic stability, and asset risk. As of December 31, 2010, undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries that met the indefinite reversal criteria amounted to $20.8 billion. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Companys effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23.5 percent to 24.5 percent in 2011. This estimated tax rate does not reflect the impact of any unusual or special items that may affect our tax rate in 2011. Contingencies Our Company is subject to various claims and contingencies, mostly related to legal proceedings and tax matters (both income taxes and indirect taxes). Due to their nature, such legal proceedings and tax matters involve inherent uncertainties including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties and governmental actions. Management assesses the probability of loss for such contingencies and accrues a liability and or discloses the relevant circumstances, as appropriate. Management believes that any liability to the Company that may arise as a result of currently pending legal proceedings, tax matters or other contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company taken as a whole. Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Standards and Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting standards and pronouncements. Operations Review Our organizational structure as of December 31, 2010, consisted of the following operating segments, the first six of which are sometimes referred to as "operating groups" or "groups": Eurasia and Africa; Europe; Latin America; North America; Pacific; Bottling Investments; and Corporate. For further information regarding our operating segments, refer to Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements In order to continually improve upon the Companys operating performance, from time to time, we engage in buying and selling ownership interests in bottling partners and other manufacturing operations. In addition, we also acquire brands or enter into license agreements for certain brands to supplement our beverage offerings. These items impact our operating results and certain key metrics used by management in assessing the Companys performance. Unit case volume growth is a key metric used by management to evaluate the Companys performance because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. The Companys unit case volume represents the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers and, therefore, reflects unit case volume for consolidated and unconsolidated bottlers. Refer to the heading "Beverage Volume," below. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates and syrups (in all cases expressed in equivalent unit cases) sold by, or used in finished products sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. Refer to the heading "Beverage Volume," below. Our Bottling Investments segment and our other finished products operations, including those managed by CCR, typically generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling beverages and a variety of still beverages, such as juices and juice drinks, energy and sports drinks, ready to drink teas and coffees, and certain water products, to retailers or to distributors, wholesalers and bottling partners who distribute them to retailers. In addition, in the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers such as restaurants and convenience stores who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. For these finished products operations, we recognize the associated concentrate sales volume at the time the unit case or unit case equivalent is sold to the customer. Our concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to authorized bottling and canning operations. For these concentrate operations, we recognize concentrate revenue and concentrate 50 sales volume when we sell concentrate to the authorized unconsolidated bottling and canning operations and we typically report unit case volume when finished products manufactured from the concentrates and syrups are sold to the customer. When we analyze our net operating revenues we generally consider the following four factors: (1) volume growth (unit case volume or concentrate sales volume, as appropriate), (2) structural changes, (3) changes in price, product and geographic mix and (4) foreign currency fluctuations. Refer to the heading "Net Operating Revenues," below. "Structural changes" generally refers to acquisitions or dispositions of bottling, distribution or canning operations and consolidation or deconsolidation of bottling and distribution entities for accounting purposes. Typically, structural changes do not impact the Companys unit case volume on a consolidated basis or at the geographic operating segment level. We recognize unit case volume for all sales of Company beverage products regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any. However, our Bottling Investments operating segment is generally impacted by structural changes because it only includes the unit case volume of consolidated bottlers. The Company sells concentrates and syrups to both consolidated and unconsolidated bottling partners. The ownership structure of our bottling partners impacts the timing of recognizing concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our consolidated bottling partners, we are not able to recognize the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume until the bottling partner has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a customer. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our unconsolidated bottling partners, we recognize the concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume when the concentrates or syrups are sold to the bottling partner. The subsequent sale of the finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a customer does not impact the timing of recognizing the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume. "Acquired brands" refers to brands acquired during the current year. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to acquired brands in periods prior to the closing of the transaction. Therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume from the sale of these brands is incremental to prior year volume. We do not generally consider acquired brands to be structural changes. "License agreements" refers to brands not owned by the Company, but for which we hold certain rights, generally including, but not limited to, distribution rights, and we derive an economic benefit from the ultimate sale of these brands. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to these brands in periods prior to the beginning of the term of the license agreement. Therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume from the sale of these brands is incremental to prior year volume. We do not generally consider new license agreements to be structural changes. The following significant transactions and agreements impacted the Companys 2010 operating results: on October 2, 2010, in legally separate transactions, we acquired CCEs North American business and entered into a license agreement with DPS; on October 2, 2010, we sold all of our ownership interests in our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE; and on January 1, 2010, we deconsolidated certain entities, primarily bottling operations, as a result of the Companys adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. The impact that each of the aforementioned items had on the Companys consolidated financial statements is discussed throughout this report, as appropriate. The sections below are intended to provide an overview of the impact these items had on our 2010 operating results and are expected to have on key metrics used by management. Acquisition of CCEs North American Business and the DPS License Agreements Immediately prior to the October 2, 2010 completion of our acquisition of CCEs North American business, the Company owned 33 percent of CCEs outstanding common stock. This ownership represented our indirect ownership interest in both CCEs North American business and its European operations. On October 2, 2010, the Company acquired the remaining 67 percent of CCEs North American business not already owned by the Company for consideration that included the Companys indirect ownership interest in CCEs European operations. As a result of this transaction, the Company now owns 100 percent of CCEs North American business and does not own any interest in New CCEs European operations. Refer to the heading "Our Business General," above, and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the acquisition. 51  The operating results of CCEs North American business are included in our consolidated financial statements effective October 2, 2010. The operating results of New CCE had no direct impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements, since we have no ownership interest in this entity. CCEs North American business contributed net revenues of approximately $3,637 million and net losses of approximately $122 million from October 2, 2010 through December 31, 2010. Furthermore, the Company recorded total assets as a result of the acquisition of $22.2 billion. Refer to the heading "Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position," below, for additional information related to the impact the acquisition had on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. On October 2, 2010, the Company also entered into an agreement with DPS to distribute certain DPS brands in territories where these brands were distributed by CCE prior to our acquisition of CCEs North American business. The license agreements replaced agreements between DPS and CCE existing immediately prior to the completion of our acquisition of CCEs North American business. Refer to the heading "Our Business General," above, and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to these new license agreements. Prior to the acquisition of CCEs North American business and entering into the DPS license agreements, the Companys North America operating segment was predominantly a concentrate operation. As a result of the acquisition of CCEs North American business and the DPS license agreements, the North America operating segment is now predominantly a finished products operation. Generally, finished products operations produce higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins and operating margins compared to concentrate operations. Refer to "Item 1. Business Products and Brands," for additional discussion of the differences between the Companys concentrate operations and our finished products operations. These transactions resulted in higher net operating revenues, but lower gross profit margins and operating margins for the North America operating segment and our consolidated operating results. Prior to the acquisition of CCEs North American business, the Company reported unit case volume for the sale of Company beverage products sold by CCE. After the transaction closing, we reported unit case volume of Company beverage products just as we had prior to the transaction. Prior to the acquisition of CCEs North American business, the Company recognized concentrate sales volume at the time we sold the concentrate to CCE. Upon the closing of the transaction, we do not recognize the concentrate sales volume until CCR has sold finished products manufactured from concentrate to a customer. The DPS license agreements impact both the Companys unit case and concentrate sales volume. Sales made pursuant to these license agreements represent acquired volume and are incremental unit case volume and concentrate sales volume to the Company. Prior to entering into the license agreements, the Company did not include the DPS brands as unit case volume or concentrate sales volume, as these brands were not Company beverage products. As mentioned above, we do not normally consider new license agreements to be structural changes. However, in the case of the DPS license agreements, given their correlation to our acquisition of CCEs North American business, we have included the impact of these license agreements as a structural change when explaining our 2010 financial results. Since we have determined it is appropriate to include the impact of the DPS license agreements as a structural change, the total revenues attributable to CCEs North American business, including DPS, recognized by the Company since the date of acquisition are considered a structural change. Prior to the acquisition, we recognized the revenues and profits associated with concentrate sales when the concentrate was sold to CCE, excluding the portion that was deemed to be intercompany due to our previous ownership interest in CCE. However, subsequent to the acquisition, the Company will not recognize the revenues and profits associated with concentrate sold to CCEs North American business until the finished products manufactured from those concentrates are sold. For example, in 2010, most of our pre Easter concentrate sales to CCE impacted our first quarter operating results. In 2011, we anticipate that most of our Easter related finished product sales will likely impact our second quarter operating results. Likewise, in 2010, most of our pre July 4th concentrate sales to CCE impacted our second quarter operating results. In 2011, the impact of the July 4th holiday related finished product sales will likely impact our third quarter operating results. As a result of this transaction, the Company does not have an indirect ownership interest in New CCEs European operations. Therefore, we are no longer required to defer the portion of revenues and profits associated with concentrate sales to New CCE. 52 In 2010, the gross profit for our North America operating segment was negatively impacted by $235 million, primarily due to the elimination of gross profit in inventory on intercompany sales and an inventory fair value adjustment as a result of the acquisition. Refer to the headings "Gross Profit Margin" and "Operating Income and Operating Margin." The acquisition of CCEs North American business has resulted in a significant adjustment to our overall cost structure, especially in North America. We estimate that approximately 35 percent of our total cost of goods in 2011 will be comprised of both the raw material and conversion costs associated with the following inputs: (1) sweeteners, (2) metals, (3) juices and (4) PET. The bulk of these costs will reside within our North America and Bottling Investments operating segments. We anticipate the underlying commodities related to these inputs will continue to face upward pressure; and therefore, we have increased our hedging activities related to certain commodities in order to mitigate a portion of the price risk associated with forecasted purchases. Many of the derivative financial instruments used by the Company to mitigate the risk associated with these commodity exposures do not qualify for hedge accounting. As a result, the change in fair value of these derivative instruments will be included as a component of net income each reporting period. Refer to the heading "Gross Profit Margin," below, and Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our commodity hedging activity. The acquisition of CCEs North American business increased the Companys selling, general and administrative expenses in 2010, primarily due to delivery related expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses are typically higher, as a percentage of net operating revenues, for finished products operations compared to concentrate operations. Selling, general and administrative expenses were also negatively impacted by the amortization of definite lived intangible assets acquired in the acquisition. The Company recorded $605 million of definite lived acquired franchise rights that are being amortized over a weighted average life of approximately 8 years, which is equal to the weighted average remaining contractual term of the acquired franchise rights. In addition, the Company recorded $380 million of customer rights that are being amortized over 20 years. We estimate the amortization expense related to these definite lived intangible assets to be approximately $100 million per year for the next several years, which will be recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Once fully integrated, we expect to generate operational synergies of at least $350 million per year. We anticipate realizing approximately $140 million to $150 million of these synergies in 2011. Refer to the heading "Other Operating Charges," below, and Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding this integration initiative. In connection with the Companys acquisition of CCEs North American business, we assumed $7,602 million of long term debt, which had an estimated fair value of $9,345 million as of the acquisition date. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we recorded the assumed debt at its fair value as of the acquisition date. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. On November 15, 2010, the Company issued $4,500 million of long term notes and used some of the proceeds to repurchase $2,910 million of long term debt. The Company used the remaining cash from the issuance to reduce our outstanding commercial paper balance. The repurchased debt consisted of $1,827 million of debt assumed in our acquisition of CCEs North American business and $1,083 million of the Companys debt that was outstanding prior to the acquisition. The Company recorded a charge of $342 million related to the premiums paid to repurchase the long term debt and the costs associated with the settlement of treasury rate locks issued in connection with the debt tender offer. Refer to the heading "Interest Expense," below, and Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In 2010, we recognized a gain of $4,978 million due to the remeasurement of our equity interest in CCE to fair value upon the close of the transaction. This gain was classified in the line item other income (loss) net in our consolidated statement of income. Although our 2010 operating results and certain key metrics were affected by these structural changes, we do not believe it is indicative of the impact they will have on future operating periods. Our 2011 consolidated financial statements will reflect twelve months of operating results of the acquired CCE North American business and DPS license agreements compared to three months in 2010. Therefore, we expect these structural changes to have a significant impact on our operating results and certain key metrics in 2011, when compared to 2010. Prior to the closing of this acquisition, we had accounted for our investment in CCE under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, we recorded our proportionate share of CCEs net income or loss 53 in the line item equity income (loss) net in our consolidated statements of income. However, as a result of this transaction, beginning October 2, 2010, the Company no longer records equity income or loss related to CCE; and therefore, we expect this transaction to negatively impact equity income in future periods. Refer to the heading "Equity Income (Loss) Net," below. Divestiture of Norwegian and Swedish Bottling Operations The divestiture of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations had no impact on our consolidated unit case volume and consolidated concentrate sales volume, for the same reasons discussed above in relation to our acquisition of CCEs North American business. The divestiture of these bottling operations reduced unit case volume for the Bottling Investments operating segment. In addition, the divestiture reduced net operating revenues and net income for our consolidated operating results and the Bottling Investments operating segment. However, since we divested a finished goods business, it had a positive impact on our gross profit margins and operating margins. Furthermore, the impact these divestitures had on the Companys net operating revenues was partially offset by the concentrate revenues that were recognized on sales to these bottling operations. These concentrate sales had previously been eliminated because they were intercompany transactions. The net impact to net operating revenues was included as a structural change in our analysis of changes to net operating revenues. Refer to the heading "Net Operating Revenues," below. This divestiture resulted in a gain of $597 million, which was classified in the line item other income (loss) net in our consolidated statement of income. Impact of New Accounting Guidance Beginning January 1, 2010, we deconsolidated certain entities as a result of the Companys adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. These entities are primarily bottling operations and have been accounted for under the equity method of accounting since they were deconsolidated. Refer to the heading "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Principles of Consolidation," above. The entities that have been deconsolidated as a result of this change in accounting guidance accounted for approximately 3 percent of the Companys consolidated net operating revenues and less than 1 percent of net income attributable to shareowners of The Coca Cola Company in 2009. Refer to the heading "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Principles of Consolidation," above. These entities accounted for approximately 4 percent of the Companys equity income in 2010. Refer to the heading "Equity Income (Loss) Net," below. The impact that the deconsolidation of these entities had on net operating revenues was included as a structural change. Refer to the heading "Net Operating Revenues," below. Beverage Volume We measure the volume of Company beverage products sold in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and (2) concentrate sales. As used in this report, "unit case" means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight ounce servings); and "unit case volume" means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers. Unit case volume primarily consists of beverage products bearing Company trademarks. Also included in unit case volume are certain products licensed to, or distributed by, our Company, and brands owned by Coca Cola system bottlers for which our Company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive economic benefit. In addition, unit case volume includes sales by joint ventures in which the Company has an equity interest. We believe unit case volume is one of the measures of the underlying strength of the Coca Cola system because it measures trends at the consumer level. The unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the Company from its bottling partners and distributors. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates and syrups (in all cases expressed in equivalent unit cases) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. Unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period. Factors such as seasonality, bottlers inventory practices, supply point changes, timing of price increases, new product introductions and changes in product mix can impact unit case volume and concentrate sales volume and can create differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. In addition to the items mentioned above, the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures, in which the Company has an equity interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates or syrups, may give rise to differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. 54 Information about our volume growth by operating segment is as follows: Percent Change 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Year Ended December 31, Unit Cases 1,2 Concentrate Sales Unit Cases 1,2 Concentrate Sales Worldwide 5 % 5 % 3 % 3 % Eurasia & Africa 12 % 12 % 4 % 5 % Europe (1 ) (2 ) Latin America 5 7 6 7 North America 2 2 (2 ) (2 ) Pacific 6 6 7 7 Bottling Investments (1 ) N/A 2 N/A 1 Bottling Investments operating segment data reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only. 2 Geographic segment data reflects unit case volume growth for all bottlers in the applicable geographic areas, both consolidated and unconsolidated. Unit Case Volume The Coca Cola system sold approximately 25.5 billion unit cases of our products in 2010, approximately 24.4 billion unit cases in 2009 and approximately 23.7 billion unit cases in 2008. Year Ended December 31, 2010, versus Year Ended December 31, 2009 In Eurasia and Africa, unit case volume increased 12 percent, which consisted of 10 percent growth in sparkling beverages and 21 percent growth in still beverages. The groups unit case volume growth was primarily attributable to 17 percent growth in India, which included growth of 15 percent and 23 percent in sparkling and still beverages, respectively. Indias growth in sparkling beverages was led by double digit growth in Trademarks Sprite, Thums Up and Coca Cola, which reflected the benefit of successful national marketing programs. Still beverage growth in India included the impact of 22 percent growth in our Maaza juice brand. In addition to growth in India, the groups unit case volume growth included 14 percent growth in Turkey, 8 percent growth in North and West Africa, 16 percent growth in Russia, 20 percent growth in Southern Eurasia, 12 percent growth in East and Central Africa and 5 percent growth in South Africa. The growth across the African continent was attributable to the strong performance of both sparkling and still beverages and the benefit of our FIFA World Cup activation programs. Unit case volume in Europe was even, which reflected the impact of continuing difficult macroeconomic conditions throughout certain regions in Europe. The groups unit case volume included unit case volume growth of 5 percent in France, 1 percent in Germany and 2 percent in our Nordic Business Unit. The growth in these regions was offset by unit case volume declines in other regions, including a 7 percent decline in South and Eastern Europe, primarily due to continuing macroeconomic pressures. The groups unit case volume also included unit case volume declines of 2 percent and 1 percent in Italy and Iberia, respectively. In Latin America, unit case volume increased 5 percent, which consisted of 4 percent growth in sparkling beverages and 9 percent growth in still beverages. The groups unit case volume growth was led by 11 percent growth in Brazil and 3 percent growth in Mexico. Brazils unit case volume growth was primarily due to 11 percent growth in sparkling beverages, led by 11 percent growth in Trademark Coca Cola. Mexicos unit case volume growth was impacted by adverse weather conditions. The groups unit case volume growth also included 5 percent growth in our South Latin Business Unit. All of the aforementioned markets benefited from our strong FIFA World Cup activation programs. Unit case volume in North America increased 2 percent, including 1 percent attributable to the new license agreements with DPS. The groups unit case volume growth was driven by 5 percent growth in still beverages, led by 19 percent growth in Trademark Powerade, 12 percent growth in teas and 23 percent growth in Trademark Simply. Unit case volume for sparkling beverages in North America increased 1 percent, primarily due to the sale of DPS brands under the new license agreements. Coca Cola Zero continued its strong performance in North America with 15 percent 55 growth in 2010. The groups strong marketing initiatives, including our FIFA World Cup activation programs, contributed to the unit case volume growth in North America. The volume and net operating revenues attributable to the sale of DPS brands have been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues. Refer to the heading "Net Operating Revenues," below, and "Structural Changes and New License Agreements," above. In Pacific, unit case volume increased 6 percent, which consisted of 13 percent growth in still beverages and 2 percent growth in sparkling beverages. The groups volume growth was led by 6 percent growth in China, 15 percent growth in the Philippines and 3 percent growth in Japan. Chinas volume growth included 21 percent growth in juices and juice drinks primarily due to the continued strong momentum of Minute Maid Pulpy, as well as strong growth in other still beverages including water. Tough weather conditions, including flooding in the higher per capita consumption regions, negatively impacted unit case volume in China. In the Philippines, unit case volume growth was led by 14 percent growth in Trademark Coca Cola. In Japan, the unit case volume growth was driven by successful in market activations, strong innovation and favorable weather conditions. Included in Japans unit case volume growth was 5 percent growth in Trademark Coca Cola, primarily due to strong FIFA World Cup activation programs and our Coca Cola Summer Promotion. Japans unit case volume growth also benefited from 17 percent growth in sports drinks. Unit case volume for Bottling Investments decreased 1 percent, primarily due to the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of the Companys adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. These entities are primarily bottling operations and have been accounted for under the equity method of accounting since they were deconsolidated on January 1, 2010. Refer to the heading "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Principles of Consolidation" and "Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements." The deconsolidation of these entities negatively impacted the unit case volume for Bottling Investments by approximately 9 percent. Unit case volume for Bottling Investments was also negatively impacted by the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE. The unfavorable impact of the aforementioned items was partially offset by growth in markets where we own or otherwise consolidate the bottling operations. Unit case volume grew 6 percent in China, 17 percent in India, 15 percent in the Philippines and 1 percent in Germany. The Companys consolidated bottling operations account for approximately 33 percent, 66 percent, 100 percent and 100 percent of the unit case volume in China, India, the Philippines and Germany, respectively. Year Ended December 31, 2009, versus Year Ended December 31, 2008 In Eurasia and Africa, unit case volume increased 4 percent, which consisted of 3 percent growth in sparkling beverages and 8 percent growth in still beverages. The groups unit case volume growth was primarily attributable to 31 percent growth in India, led by 32 percent growth in sparkling beverages. The sparkling beverages growth in India was largely due to double digit growth in Trademarks Thums Up, Sprite, Fanta and Coca Cola. Still beverages in India grew 28 percent, driven by double digit growth in Trademark Maaza. The group also benefited from 6 percent volume growth in North and West Africa and 10 percent volume growth in East and Central Africa. The groups unit case volume growth also included the impact of a 14 percent volume decline in Russia, primarily due to a challenging economic environment. In addition, South Africa and Turkey each experienced a 1 percent unit case volume decline. Unit case volume in Europe decreased 1 percent, primarily attributable to difficult macroeconomic conditions throughout most of Europe. These difficult macroeconomic conditions impacted a number of key markets and contributed to unit case volume declines of 8 percent in South and Eastern Europe, 4 percent in Iberia and 2 percent in Germany. The volume declines in these markets were partially offset by 6 percent unit case volume growth in France and 4 percent growth in Great Britain. The unit case volume growth in both France and Great Britain was led by Trademark Coca Cola. In Latin America, unit case volume increased 6 percent, which consisted of 3 percent growth in sparkling beverages and 24 percent growth in still beverages. The group benefited from strong volume growth in key markets, including 6 percent in Mexico, 4 percent in Brazil, 2 percent in Argentina and double digit growth in Colombia. Acquisitions contributed 1 percentage point of the groups total unit case volume growth. The groups sparkling beverage volume growth was primarily attributable to 4 percent growth in brand Coca Cola. The successful integration of Jugos del Valle, S.A.B. de C.V. ("Jugos del Valle") drove still beverage volume growth. 56 Unit case volume in North America decreased 2 percent, which reflected the impact of a difficult U.S. economic environment and a competitive pricing environment. The effect of the economic environment and pricing environment was partially offset by the impact of strong customer and consumer programs. North Americas unit case volume decline consisted of a 3 percent decline in sparkling beverages, partially offset by 1 percent growth in still beverages. The decline in sparkling beverages was partly attributable to the significant price increase taken by bottlers in the fourth quarter of 2008. The decline was partially offset by the continued strong performance of Coca Cola Zero, which had unit case volume growth of 19 percent. Still beverage unit case volume growth was primarily due to the strong performance of Fuze Beverage, LLC ("Fuze"), Trademark Simply and tea. The unit case volume growth in still beverages was reduced by a double digit volume decline in the North American water businesses, including Trademark Dasani, primarily due to the slowing water category and the Companys decision to not pursue unprofitable volume opportunities in bulk water/case packs in North America. In Pacific, unit case volume increased 7 percent, which consisted of growth in sparkling and still beverages of 6 percent and 8 percent, respectively. Sparkling beverage growth in Pacific included 14 percent growth in Trademark Sprite and 5 percent growth in Trademark Coca Cola. The groups volume growth was led by 16 percent growth in China, which reflected 11 percent growth in sparkling beverages and 30 percent growth in still beverages. Chinas sparkling beverage volume growth was led by double digit growth in Trademark Sprite and 6 percent growth in Trademark Coca Cola. Chinas still beverage volume growth was led by double digit growth in Minute Maid. The unit case volume growth in China was partially offset by a 2 percent volume decline in Japan, primarily due to the continued severe economic challenges and unfavorable weather conditions during what are traditionally high volume months. Sparkling beverage volume in Japan was even, while still beverages declined 3 percent. The decline in still beverages included the impact of a 5 percent volume decline in Aquarius and a 3 percent decline in Georgia Coffee. Due to the weak economy, Georgia Coffee was negatively impacted by shifts away from the at work vending channel. The groups volume increase also included a 1 percent increase in the Philippines. Unit case volume for Bottling Investments increased 2 percent, primarily due to the impact of unit case volume growth of 16 percent in China, 31 percent in India and 1 percent in the Philippines. The Companys consolidated bottling operations account for approximately 33 percent, 65 percent and 100 percent of the unit case volume in China, India and the Philippines, respectively. The favorable impact of unit case volume in these markets was partially offset by the sale of certain bottling operations during 2008, including Refrigerantes Minas Gerais Ltda. ("Remil"), a bottler in Brazil, and the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in Coca Cola Beverages Pakistan Ltd. ("Coca Cola Pakistan"), which resulted in its deconsolidation. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, Germanys unit case volume declined 2 percent. The Companys consolidated bottling operations account for 100 percent of the unit case volume in Germany. Concentrate Sales Volume In 2010, concentrate sales volume and unit case volume both grew 5 percent compared to 2009. In 2009, concentrate sales volume and unit case volume both grew 3 percent compared to 2008. The differences between concentrate sales volume and unit case volume growth rates for individual operating segments in 2010 and 2009 were primarily due to the timing of concentrate shipments and the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the Company has an equity interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates, syrups, beverage bases or powders. 57 Analysis of Consolidated Statements of Income Percent Change Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 (In millions except percentages and per share data) NET OPERATING REVENUES $ 35,119 $ 30,990 $ 31,944 13 % (3 )% Cost of goods sold 12,693 11,088 11,374 14 (3 ) GROSS PROFIT 22,426 19,902 20,570 13 (3 ) GROSS PROFIT MARGIN 63.9 % 64.2 % 64.4 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 13,158 11,358 11,774 16 (4 ) Other operating charges 819 313 350 * * OPERATING INCOME 8,449 8,231 8,446 3 (3 ) OPERATING MARGIN 24.1 % 26.6 % 26.4 % Interest income 317 249 333 27 (25 ) Interest expense 733 355 438 106 (19 ) Equity income (loss) net 1,025 781 (874 ) 31 * Other income (loss) net 5,185 40 39 * * INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 14,243 8,946 7,506 59 19 Income taxes 2,384 2,040 1,632 17 25 Effective tax rate 16.7 % 22.8 % 21.7 % CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME 11,859 6,906 5,874 72 18 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 50 82 67 (39 ) 22 NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO SHAREOWNERS OF THE COCA COLA COMPANY $ 11,809 $ 6,824 $ 5,807 73 % 18 % NET INCOME PER SHARE1 Basic net income per share $ 5.12 $ 2.95 $ 2.51 74 % 18 % Diluted net income per share $ 5.06 $ 2.93 $ 2.49 73 % 18 % * Calculation is not meaningful. 1 Basic net income per share and diluted net income per share are calculated based on net income attributable to shareowners of The Coca Cola Company. 58 Net Operating Revenues Year Ended December 31, 2010, versus Year Ended December 31, 2009 Net operating revenues increased by $4,129 million, or 13 percent. The following table illustrates, on a percentage basis, the estimated impact of key factors resulting in the increase (decrease) in net operating revenues by operating segment: Percent Change 2010 vs. 2009 Structural changes Volume 1 Volume 2 Other Price, product & geographic mix Currency fluctuations Total Consolidated 5 % % 5 % 1 % 2 % 13 % Eurasia & Africa 12 % % % (2 )% 6 % 16 % Europe 2 1 (2 ) 1 Latin America 7 (13 ) 9 3 6 North America 1 1 32 1 35 Pacific 6 1 (5 ) 6 8 Bottling Investments 10 (11 ) (1 ) 2 Corporate * * * * * * * Calculation is not meaningful. 1 Represents the percent change in net operating revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in concentrate sales volume for our geographic operating segments, excluding the impact of volume associated with new license agreements (expressed in equivalent unit cases).

Our Bottling Investments operating segment data reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only. Refer to the heading "Beverage Volume," above. 2 Represents the percent change in net operating revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in concentrate sales volume related to new license agreements for our geographic operating segments. For our Bottling Investments operating segment, this represents the percent change in net operating revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume for the Bottling Investments operating segment due to structural changes. Our Bottling Investments operating segment data reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only. Refer to the heading "Beverage Volume," above. Refer to the heading "Beverage Volume," above, for additional information related to changes in our unit case and concentrate sales volume. Refer to the heading "Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements," above, for additional information related to significant structural changes. Price, product and geographic mix had a favorable 1 percent impact on consolidated net operating revenues. Price, product and geographic mix for our operating segments was impacted by a variety of factors and events including, but not limited to, the following: consolidated results were unfavorably impacted by geographic mix as a result of growth in our emerging and developing markets. The growth in our emerging and developing markets resulted in unfavorable geographic mix due to the fact that the revenue per unit sold in these markets is generally less than in developed markets; Eurasia and Africa was negatively impacted by unfavorable geographic mix due to the growth in emerging and developing markets such as India and Russia. The revenue per unit sold in these markets is generally less than in developed markets; Latin America was favorably impacted by pricing in a number of our key markets and the impact of still beverages growing faster than sparkling beverages; Pacific was negatively impacted by unfavorable geographic mix due to the growth in emerging and developing markets such as China and the Philippines. The revenue per unit sold in these markets is generally less than in developed markets. 59  The favorable impact of currency fluctuations increased net operating revenues by approximately 2 percent. The favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was primarily due to a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Brazilian real, South African rand and Australian dollar, which had a favorable impact on the Eurasia and Africa, Latin America, Pacific and Bottling Investments operating segments. The favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to the aforementioned currencies was partially offset by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the euro and British pound, which had an unfavorable impact on the Europe and Bottling Investments operating segments. Refer to the heading "Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position Foreign Exchange." Year Ended December 31, 2009, versus Year Ended December 31, 2008 Net operating revenues decreased by $954 million, or 3 percent.

Our Bottling Investments operating segment data reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only. Refer to the heading "Beverage Volume," above. Refer to the heading "Beverage Volume," above, for additional information related to changes in our unit case and concentrate sales volume. Structural changes accounted for approximately 1 percent of the decrease in net operating revenues. This decrease was primarily attributable to the sale of certain bottling operations during 2008, including Remil and a portion of our ownership interest in Coca Cola Pakistan, which resulted in its deconsolidation. Refer to the heading "Operations Review Other Income (Loss) Net" and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Price, product and geographic mix had a net zero percent impact on consolidated net operating revenues. Price, product and geographic mix for our operating segments was impacted by a variety of factors and events including, but not limited to, the following: consolidated results were unfavorably impacted by shifts in our marketing and media spend strategies. The shift in our marketing and media spend strategies was primarily due to spending more marketing dollars toward in store activations, loyalty points programs and point of sale marketing. Many of these strategies impact net revenues instead of marketing expenses. Refer to the heading "Selling, General and Administrative Expenses," below; consolidated results were unfavorably impacted by geographic mix as a result of growth in our emerging and developing markets. The growth in our emerging and developing markets resulted in unfavorable geographic mix due to the fact that the revenue per unit sold in these markets is generally less than in developed markets; Latin America benefited from the successful integration of Jugos del Valle. Refer to the heading "Beverage Volume," above; 60 North America was favorably impacted by the growth of our still beverage volume, primarily due to the strong performance of Fuze, Trademark Simply and tea. Refer to the heading "Beverage Volume," above; Pacific was negatively impacted by unfavorable geographic mix due to the growth in emerging and developing markets such as China and a decline in Japan, a developed market. Refer to the heading "Beverage Volume," above. The revenue per unit sold in emerging and developing markets is generally less than in developed markets. The Pacific operating segment was also unfavorably impacted by shifts away from the at work vending channel in our Japanese business. The unfavorable impact of currency fluctuations decreased net operating revenues by approximately 5 percent. The unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to most foreign currencies, including the euro, South African rand, British pound, Brazilian real, Mexican peso and Australian dollar, which had an unfavorable impact on the Eurasia and Africa, Europe, Latin America, Pacific and Bottling Investments operating segments. The unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the aforementioned currencies was partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen, which had a favorable impact on the Pacific operating segment. Refer to the heading "Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position Foreign Exchange." Net Operating Revenues by Operating Segment Information about our net operating revenues by operating segment as a percentage of Company net operating revenues is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Eurasia & Africa 6.9 % 6.4 % 6.7 % Europe 12.6 13.9 15.0 Latin America 11.0 12.0 11.3 North America 31.7 26.4 25.7 Pacific 14.1 14.6 13.7 Bottling Investments 23.4 26.4 27.3 Corporate 0.3 0.3 0.3 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % The percentage contribution of each operating segment has changed due to net operating revenues in certain operating segments growing at a faster rate compared to the other operating segments. Net operating revenue growth rates are impacted by sales volume, structural changes, price and product/geographic mix, and foreign currency fluctuations. In 2010, the percentage of the Companys net operating revenues contributed by our North America operating segment increased by 5.3 percent, primarily due to our acquisition of CCEs North American business and sales related to our new license agreements with DPS. In 2011, we expect the percentage contribution by our North America operating segment to increase from 2010 due to the full year impact of these structural items. During the fourth quarter of 2010, the first quarter of operation following our acquisition of CCEs North American business and the new license agreements with DPS, our North America operating segment contributed 45.8 percent of the Companys net operating revenues. Although the fourth quarter of 2010 may not be indicative of the full year 2011 percentage contribution, it provides trend information related to the potential future impact of these structural changes. In addition, in 2010, the percentage of the Companys net operating revenues contributed by our Bottling Investments operating segment decreased by 3.0 percent, primarily due to the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of the Companys adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB and the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE. Refer to the heading "Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements," above. The size and timing of structural changes are not consistent from period to period. As a result, anticipating the impact of such events on future net operating revenues, and other financial statement line items, usually is not possible. We expect structural changes to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements in future periods. 61 Gross Profit Margin Year Ended December 31, 2010, versus Year Ended December 31, 2009 Our gross profit margin decreased to 63.9 percent from 64.2 percent. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of our acquisition of CCEs North American business, partially offset by favorable geographic mix, product mix, the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations and the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of the Companys adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. Refer to the heading "Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements," above, for additional information regarding the impact of our acquisition of CCEs North American business, the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations and the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of the Companys adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. The favorable geographic mix was primarily due to many of our emerging markets recovering from the global recession at a quicker pace than our developed markets. Although this shift in geographic mix has a negative impact on net operating revenues, it generally has a favorable impact on our gross profit margin due to the correlated impact it has on our product mix. The product mix in the majority of our emerging and developing markets is more heavily skewed toward our sparkling beverage products, which generally yield a higher gross profit margin compared to our still beverages and finished products. Refer to the heading "Net Operating Revenues," above. In 2011, we expect our gross profit margin to decline due to the full year impact of consolidating CCEs North American business, as well as an increase in commodity costs. The acquisition of CCEs North American business has resulted in a significant adjustment to our overall cost structure, especially in North America. Finished products operations typically have lower gross profit margins and the additional commodity risk could lead to higher raw material costs in 2011. Subsequent to this transaction, approximately 35 percent of our consolidated cost of goods sold is comprised of the raw material and conversion cost associated with the following inputs: (1) sweeteners, (2) metals, (3) juices and (4) PET. The majority of these costs are incurred by our North America and Bottling Investments operating segments. We anticipate that the cost of underlying commodities related to these inputs will continue to face upward pressure. We expect the full year 2011 impact of increased commodity costs on our total company results to range between $300 million and $400 million. Upon the close of our acquisition of CCEs North American business, we increased our hedging activities related to certain commodities in order to mitigate a portion of the price risk associated with forecasted purchases. Many of the derivative financial instruments used by the Company to mitigate the risk associated with these commodity exposures do not qualify for hedge accounting. As a result, the change in fair value of these derivative instruments will be included as a component of net income each reporting period. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Year Ended December 31, 2009, versus Year Ended December 31, 2008 Our gross profit margin decreased to 64.2 percent in 2009 from 64.4 percent in 2008, primarily due to foreign currency fluctuations, the growth of our finished products operations, unfavorable geographic mix as a result of growth in our emerging and developing markets, our current focus to drive greater affordability initiatives across many key markets, and unfavorable channel and product mix in certain key markets. The unfavorable impact of the previously mentioned items was partially offset by the favorable impact of price increases in certain markets, lower costs related to several key commodities and the sale of certain bottling operations in 2008. Generally, bottling and finished products operations produce higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins compared to concentrate and syrup operations. Bottling operations sold in 2008 included Remil and a portion of our ownership interest in Coca Cola Pakistan, which resulted in its deconsolidation. Refer to the heading "Other Income (Loss) Net," below, and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 62  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The following table sets forth the significant components of selling, general and administrative expenses (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Stock based compensation expense $ 380 $ 241 $ 266 Advertising expenses 2,917 2,791 2,998 Bottling and distribution expenses 3,902 2,627 2,815 Other operating expenses 5,959 5,699 5,695 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 13,158 $ 11,358 $ 11,774 Year Ended December 31, 2010, versus Year Ended December 31, 2009 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $1,800 million, or 16 percent. Foreign currency fluctuations increased selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately 1 percent. The increase in stock based compensation was primarily related to higher payouts tied to performance in conjunction with our long term incentive compensation programs and the impact of modifications made to certain replacement performance share unit awards issued by the Company in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business. The Company modified primarily all of these replacement performance share unit awards to eliminate the remaining holding period, which resulted in approximately $74 million of accelerated expense in the fourth quarter of 2010. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in advertising expenses reflected the Companys continued investment in our brands and building market execution capabilities. The increase in bottling and distribution expenses was primarily related to the impact of our acquisition of CCEs North American business and our continued investments in our other bottling operations. The unfavorable impact of these items was partially offset by the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of the Companys adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. These entities are primarily bottling operations and accounted for approximately 2 percent of the Companys consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses in 2009. Bottling and distribution expenses were also reduced due to the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE. Refer to the heading "Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements," above, for additional information related to significant structural changes. In 2011, our pension expense is expected to increase by approximately $60 million compared to 2010. The anticipated increase is primarily due to the impact of our acquisition of CCEs North American business and a decrease in our discount rate compared to 2010. The expected unfavorable impact of these items will be partially offset by the expected favorable impact of approximately $800 million of anticipated contributions to various plans in 2011, of which approximately $750 million was contributed in the first quarter of 2011. Approximately half of the anticipated 2011 contributions will be allocated to our primary U.S. pension plans. Refer to the heading "Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position" for information related to these contributions. Refer to the heading "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Pension Plan Valuations," and Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the discount rates used by the Company. As of December 31, 2010, we had $457 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share based compensation arrangements granted under our plans. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.7 years as stock based compensation expense. This expected cost does not include the impact of any future stock based compensation awards. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Year Ended December 31, 2009, versus Year Ended December 31, 2008 Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $416 million, or 4 percent. The decrease was primarily attributable to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, which decreased selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately 4 percent. Advertising expenses were impacted by shifts in our marketing and media spend strategies, primarily due to spending more marketing dollars toward in store activations, loyalty points programs and point of sale marketing. Many of these strategies impact net operating revenues instead of marketing expenses. Refer to the heading "Net Operating Revenues," above. The decrease in bottling and distribution expenses was primarily attributable to the full year impact of certain bottling operations sold in 2008. Bottling operations sold in 2008 included Remil and a 63 portion of our ownership interest in Coca Cola Pakistan, which resulted in its deconsolidation. Other operating expenses reflects the impact of an increase in pension costs and higher short term incentive costs, partially offset by savings generated from the Companys ongoing productivity initiatives. The increase in our pension expense was primarily attributable to the significant decline in the value of our pension plan assets precipitated by the credit crisis and financial system instability in 2008. As a result of this decline, along with a decrease in the discount rate, our 2009 pension costs increased by $103 million. Other Operating Charges Other operating charges incurred by operating segment were as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Eurasia & Africa $ 7 $ 4 $ 1 Europe 50 7 Latin America 1 North America 133 31 56 Pacific 22 1 Bottling Investments 122 141 46 Corporate 485 129 246 Total $ 819 $ 313 $ 350 In 2010, the Company incurred other operating charges of approximately $819 million, which consisted of $478 million associated with the Companys productivity, integration and restructuring initiatives, $250 million related to charitable contributions, $81 million due to transaction costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business and the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE and $10 million of charges related to bottling activities in Eurasia. The Companys integration activities include costs associated with the integration of CCEs North American business, as well as the integration of 18 German bottling and distribution operations acquired in 2007. The charitable contributions were primarily attributable to a cash donation to The Coca Cola Foundation. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the transaction costs. In 2010, the Company began an integration initiative related to our acquisition of CCEs North American business, which resulted in total expenses of $135 million. These expenses were primarily related to both internal and external costs associated with the development and design of our future operating framework. These charges impacted the North America and Corporate operating segments. Our acquisition of CCEs North American business closed on October 2, 2010. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe this acquisition will result in an evolved franchise system that will enable us to better serve the unique needs of the North American market. The creation of a unified operating system will strategically position us to better market and distribute our nonalcoholic beverage brands in North America. We are reconfiguring our manufacturing, supply chain and logistics operations to achieve cost reductions over time. Once fully integrated, we expect to generate operational synergies of at least $350 million per year. We anticipate that these operational synergies will be phased in over the next four years, and that we will begin to fully realize the annual benefit from these synergies in the fourth year. We currently expect to realize approximately $140 million to $150 million of these synergies in 2011. Upon completion of the CCE transaction, we combined the management of the acquired North American business with the management of our existing foodservice business, Minute Maid and Odwalla juice businesses, North America supply chain operations and Company owned bottling operations in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, into a unified bottling and customer service organization called CCR. In addition, we reshaped our remaining CCNA operations into an organization that primarily provides franchise leadership and consumer marketing and innovation for the North American market. As a result of the transaction and related reorganization, our North American businesses operate as aligned and agile organizations with distinct capabilities, responsibilities and strengths. The Company currently expects the total cost of these integration initiatives to be approximately $425 million and anticipates recognizing these charges over the next three years. 64 The Companys integration initiatives include costs related to the integration of 18 German bottling and distribution operations acquired in 2007. The Company began these integration initiatives in 2008 and has incurred total pretax expenses of approximately $225 million since they commenced. The expenses recorded in connection with these integration activities have been primarily due to involuntary terminations. The Company is currently reviewing other integration and restructuring opportunities within the German bottling and distribution operations, which if implemented will result in additional charges in future periods. However, as of December 31, 2010, the Company had not finalized any additional plans. Refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to this integration initiative. The Company has recognized costs of approximately $352 million related to our ongoing productivity initiatives since they commenced in the first quarter of 2008. The Company is targeting $500 million in annualized savings from productivity initiatives by the end of 2011 to provide additional flexibility to invest for growth. The savings are expected to be generated in a number of areas and include aggressively managing operating expenses supported by lean techniques, redesigning key processes to drive standardization and effectiveness, better leveraging our size and scale, and driving savings in indirect costs through the implementation of a "procure to pay" program. In realizing these savings, the Company expects to incur total costs of approximately $500 million by the end of 2011. The Company believes we are on track to achieve our $500 million target in annualized savings by the end of 2011. Refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the Companys ongoing productivity initiatives. In 2009, the Company incurred other operating charges of $313 million, which consisted of $273 million related to the Companys productivity, integration and restructuring initiatives and $40 million due to asset impairments. Refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our productivity, integration and restructuring initiatives. The impairment charges were related to a $23 million impairment of an intangible asset and a $17 million impairment of a building. The impairment of the intangible asset was due to a change in the expected useful life of the asset, which was previously determined to have an indefinite life. The $17 million impairment was due to a change in disposal strategy related to a building that is no longer occupied. The Company had originally intended to sell the building along with the related land. However, we have determined that the maximum potential sales proceeds would likely be realized through the sale of vacant land. As a result, the building was removed. The land is not considered held for sale, primarily due to the fact that it is not probable a sale would be completed within one year. In 2008, the Company incurred other operating charges of $350 million, which consisted of $249 million due to productivity and restructuring initiatives, $63 million related to contract termination fees and $38 million due to asset impairments. Refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our productivity and restructuring initiatives. The contract termination fees were primarily the result of penalties incurred by the Company to terminate existing supply and co packer agreements. The asset impairment charges were primarily due to the write down of manufacturing lines that produced product packaging materials. 65 Operating Income and Operating Margin Information about our operating income contribution by operating segment on a percentage basis is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Eurasia & Africa 11.6 % 9.8 % 9.9 % Europe 35.2 35.8 37.6 Latin America 28.5 24.8 24.8 North America 18.0 20.7 18.8 Pacific 24.2 22.9 22.0 Bottling Investments 2.7 2.2 3.1 Corporate (20.2 ) (16.2 ) (16.2 ) Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Information about our operating margin on a consolidated basis and by operating segment is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Consolidated 24.1 % 26.6 % 26.4 % Eurasia & Africa 40.4 % 41.0 % 39.1 % Europe 67.3 68.4 66.4 Latin America 62.0 55.2 57.9 North America 13.6 20.7 19.3 Pacific 41.4 41.6 42.6 Bottling Investments 2.8 2.2 3.0 Corporate * * * * Calculation is not meaningful. As demonstrated by the tables above, the percentage contribution to operating income and operating margin by operating segment fluctuated from year to year. Operating income and operating margin by operating segment were influenced by a variety of factors and events including the following: In 2010, foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted consolidated operating income by approximately 3 percent. The favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was primarily due to a weaker U.S. dollar compared to most foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Brazilian real, South African rand and Australian dollar, which had a favorable impact on the Eurasia and Africa, Latin America, Pacific and Bottling Investments operating segments. The favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to the aforementioned currencies was partially offset by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the euro and British pound, which had an unfavorable impact on the Europe and Bottling Investments operating segments. Refer to the heading "Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position Foreign Exchange." In 2010, operating income was favorably impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by approximately 7 percent for Eurasia and Africa, 3 percent for Latin America, 8 percent for Pacific and 9 percent for Bottling Investments. Operating income was unfavorably impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by approximately 1 percent for Europe. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates had a nominal impact on operating income for North America and Corporate. In 2010, our consolidated operating margin was favorably impacted by geographic mix. The favorable geographic mix was primarily due to many of our emerging markets recovering from the global recession at a quicker pace than our developed markets. Although this shift in geographic mix has a negative impact on net operating revenues, it generally has a favorable impact on our gross profit margin and operating margin due to the correlated impact it has on our product mix. The product mix in the majority of our emerging and developing markets is more heavily skewed toward products in our sparkling beverage portfolio, which generally yield a higher gross profit margin compared to our still beverages and finished products. 66 In 2010, our consolidated operating margin was favorably impacted by the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of the Companys adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. These entities are primarily bottling operations and have been accounted for under the equity method of accounting since they were deconsolidated on January 1, 2010. Generally, bottling and finished products operations produce higher net revenues but lower operating margins compared to concentrate and syrup operations. The majority of the deconsolidated entities had previously been included in our Bottling Investments operating segment. In 2010, the operating margin for the Latin America operating segment was favorably impacted by the sale of 50 percent of our ownership interest in Le&atilde;o Junior resulting in its deconsolidation, as well as the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of the Companys adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. Price and product mix also favorably impacted Latin Americas operating income and operating margin during the year. In 2010, the operating margin for the North America operating segment was unfavorably impacted by the Companys acquisition of CCEs North American business. Generally, bottling and finished products operations have higher net operating revenues but lower operating margins when compared to concentrate and syrup operations. Refer to the heading "Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements," above. In 2010, operating income for the North America operating segment was reduced by $74 million due to the acceleration of expense associated with certain share based replacement awards issued in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2010, operating income for the North America operating segment was negatively impacted by $235 million, primarily due to the elimination of gross profit in inventory on intercompany sales and an inventory fair value adjustment as a result of our acquisition of CCEs North American business. Prior to the acquisition, we recognized the profit associated with concentrate sales when the concentrate was sold to CCE, excluding the portion that was deemed to be intercompany due to our previous ownership interest in CCE. However, subsequent to the acquisition, the Company will not recognize the profit associated with concentrate sold to CCEs legacy North American business until the finished beverage products made from those concentrates are sold. In 2010, operating income for the North America operating segment was reduced by $20 million due to the amortization of favorable supply contracts acquired in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business. In 2010, operating income was reduced by $7 million for Eurasia and Africa, $50 million for Europe, $133 million for North America, $22 million for Pacific, $122 million for Bottling Investments and $485 million for Corporate, primarily due to the Companys productivity, integration and restructuring initiatives, charitable donations, transaction costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business and the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE and other charges related to bottling activities in Eurasia. Refer to the heading "Other Operating Charges," above. In 2009, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted consolidated operating income by approximately 11 percent. The unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to most foreign currencies, including the euro, South African rand, British pound, Brazilian real, Mexican peso and Australian dollar, which had an unfavorable impact on the Eurasia and Africa, Europe, Latin America, Pacific and Bottling Investments operating segments. The unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the aforementioned currencies was partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen, which had a favorable impact on the Pacific operating segment. Refer to the heading "Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position Foreign Exchange." In 2009, operating income was unfavorably impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by approximately 15 percent for Eurasia and Africa, 11 percent for Europe, 18 percent for Latin America, 1 percent for North America, 19 percent for Bottling Investments and 4 percent for Corporate. Operating income was favorably impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by approximately 3 percent for Pacific. 67 In 2009, shifts in our marketing and media spend strategies favorably impacted the operating margin in the majority of our operating segments. The shift was primarily due to spending more marketing dollars toward in store activations, improving shelf impact, loyalty points programs and point of sale marketing. Many of these strategies are recorded as deductions from revenues instead of marketing expenses. Refer to the heading "Net Operating Revenues," above. In 2009, lower commodity prices favorably impacted North Americas operating margin. In 2009, the operating margins for the Latin America and North America operating segments were unfavorably impacted by the growth of our finished goods businesses. Generally, bottling and finished products operations produce higher net revenues but lower operating margins compared to concentrate and syrup operations. In 2009, our consolidated operating margin was favorably impacted by the sale of certain bottling operations during 2008, including Remil and a portion of our ownership interest in Coca Cola Pakistan, which resulted in its deconsolidation. Generally, bottling and finished products operations produce higher net revenues but lower operating margins compared to concentrate and syrup operations. In 2009, operating income was reduced by approximately $4 million for Eurasia and Africa, $7 million for Europe, $31 million for North America, $1 million for Pacific, $141 million for Bottling Investments and $129 million for Corporate, primarily as a result of restructuring costs, the Companys ongoing productivity initiatives and asset impairments. Refer to the heading "Other Operating Charges," above. In 2008, operating income was reduced by approximately $1 million for Eurasia and Africa, $1 million for Latin America, $56 million for North America, $46 million for Bottling Investments and $246 million for Corporate, primarily due to restructuring costs, contract termination fees, productivity initiatives and asset impairments. Refer to the heading "Other Operating Charges," above. Interest Income Year Ended December 31, 2010, versus Year Ended December 31, 2009 Interest income increased by $68 million, or 27 percent. The increase was primarily due to the impact of higher average cash and short term investment balances, partially offset by lower average interest rates. Year Ended December 31, 2009, versus Year Ended December 31, 2008 Interest income decreased by $84 million, or 25 percent. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest rates, partially offset by the impact of higher short term investment balances. Interest Expense Year Ended December 31, 2010, versus Year Ended December 31, 2009 Interest expense increased $378 million, primarily due to a $342 million charge related to the premiums paid to repurchase long term debt and the costs associated with the settlement of treasury rate locks issued in connection with the debt tender offer. The increase also reflects the impact of interest expense on debt assumed from CCE. In connection with the Companys acquisition of CCEs North American business, we assumed $266 million of short term borrowings and $7,602 million of long term debt. The estimated fair value of the long term debt was approximately $9,345 million as of the acquisition date. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we recorded the assumed debt at its fair value as of the acquisition date. On November 15, 2010, the Company issued $4,500 million of long term notes and used some of the proceeds to repurchase $2,910 million of long term debt. The remaining cash from the issuance was used to reduce our outstanding commercial paper balance. As of December 31, 2010, the carrying value of the Companys long term debt included approximately $994 million of fair value adjustments related to the debt assumed from CCE. These fair value adjustments will be amortized over a weighted average period of approximately 15 years, which is equal to the weighted average maturity of the assumed debt to which these fair value adjustments relate. The amortization of these fair value adjustments will be a reduction of interest expense in future periods, which will typically result in our interest expense being less than the actual interest paid to service the debt. Total interest paid was $422 million in 2010. 68  Year Ended December 31, 2009, versus Year Ended December 31, 2008 Interest expense decreased by $83 million, or 19 percent. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates on short term debt, partially offset by the issuance of long term debt in the first quarter of 2009. The Company elected to replace a certain amount of commercial paper and short term debt with longer term debt, which resulted in the Company issuing long term notes in the principal amounts of $900 million at a rate of 3.625 percent and $1,350 million at a rate of 4.875 percent due March 15, 2014, and March 15, 2019, respectively. The interest rates on the long term notes are higher than the interest rates on our short term debt. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, interest expense in 2008 included the impact of the reclassification of approximately $17 million of previously unrecognized gains on interest rate locks from AOCI to interest expense, which was partially offset by approximately $9 million of losses related to the portion of cash flow hedges that were deemed to be ineffective. The reclassification was the result of a discontinued cash flow hedging relationship on interest rate locks, as it was no longer probable that we would issue the long term debt for which these hedges were designated. Equity Income (Loss) Net Year Ended December 31, 2010, versus Year Ended December 31, 2009 Equity income (loss) net represents our Companys proportionate share of net income or loss from each of our equity method investments. In 2010, equity income was $1,025 million, compared to equity income of $781 million in 2009, an increase of $244 million, or 31 percent. The increase was primarily due to our proportionate share of increased net income from certain of our equity method investees; the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations; a decrease in the Companys proportionate share of asset impairments and restructuring charges recorded by equity method investees; and the impact of the Companys adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. The impact of these items was partially offset by the impact of our acquisition of CCEs North American business, which resulted in the consolidation of CCEs North American business. As a result of this transaction, the Company stopped recording equity income related to CCE beginning October 2, 2010. Refer to the heading "Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements," above. The Companys adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB resulted in the deconsolidation of certain entities. These entities are primarily bottling operations and have been accounted for under the equity method of accounting since they were deconsolidated on January 1, 2010. Refer to the heading "Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements," above. The entities that have been deconsolidated accounted for approximately 4 percent of the Companys equity income in 2010. Year Ended December 31, 2009, versus Year Ended December 31, 2008 In 2009, equity income was $781 million, compared to an equity loss of $874 million in 2008, an increase of $1,655 million. In 2008, equity income (loss) net was impacted by our proportionate share of approximately $7.6 billion of pretax charges ($4.9 billion after tax) recorded by CCE due to impairments of its North American franchise rights. The Companys proportionate share of these charges was approximately $1.6 billion. Refer to the heading "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Goodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets," and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in equity income in 2009 was also partially attributable to our proportionate share of increased net income from certain of our equity method investees, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange fluctuations and the Companys proportionate share of asset impairments and restructuring charges recorded by equity method investees. Other Income (Loss) Net Other income (loss) net includes, among other things, the impact of foreign exchange gains and losses, dividend income, rental income, gains and losses related to the disposal of property, plant and equipment, realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities, realized gains and losses on available for sale securities, other than temporary impairments of available for sale securities and the accretion of expense related to certain acquisitions. The foreign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies. The effects of the remeasurement of these assets 69 and liabilities are partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2010, other income (loss) net was income of $5,185 million, primarily related to a $4,978 million gain related to the remeasurement of our equity investment in CCE to fair value upon the close of our acquisition of CCEs North American business and a $597 million gain related to the sale of all of our ownership interests in our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE. Refer to the heading "Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements," above, and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These gains were partially offset by a $265 million charge related to preexisting relationships with CCE and foreign currency exchange losses of $148 million. The charge related to preexisting relationships was primarily due to the write off of our investment in infrastructure programs with CCE. The foreign currency exchange losses were primarily due to a charge of approximately $103 million related to the remeasurement of our Venezuelan subsidiarys net assets. Refer to the heading "Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position Foreign Exchange." In addition to the items mentioned above, other income (loss) net also included a $23 million gain on the sale of 50 percent of our investment in Le&atilde;o Junior and $48 million of charges related to other than temporary impairments and a donation of preferred shares in one of our equity investees. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2009, other income (loss) net was income of $40 million, primarily related to a realized gain of approximately $44 million on the sale of equity securities classified as available for sale, $40 million from the sale of other investments and $18 million of dividend income from cost method investments. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the gain on the sale of available for sale securities. These gains were partially offset by approximately $34 million in net foreign currency exchange losses and an other than temporary impairment charge of approximately $27 million on a cost method investment. Refer to the heading "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Investments in Equity and Debt Securities," and Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2008, other income (loss) net was income of $39 million. The Company recognized gains on divestitures of approximately $119 million, primarily related to the sale of Remil to Coca Cola FEMSA and the sale of a portion of the Companys investment in Coca Cola Pakistan to Coca Cola Icecek A.S. ("Coca Cola Icecek"). Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other income (loss) net also included approximately $24 million in net foreign currency exchange gains in 2008. The gains on divestitures and net foreign currency exchange were partially offset by other than temporary impairment charges of approximately $81 million on available for sale securities. Refer to the heading "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Investments in Equity and Debt Securities," and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other income (loss) net also included approximately $46 million of realized and unrealized losses on trading securities. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate reflects tax benefits derived from significant operations outside the United States, which are generally taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent. A change in the mix of pretax income from these various tax jurisdictions can have a significant impact on the Companys periodic effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate of approximately 16.7 percent for the year ended December 31, 2010, included the following: an approximate 27 percent combined effective tax rate on the Companys productivity, integration and restructuring initiatives, charitable donations, transaction costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business and the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE and other charges related to bottling activities in Eurasia (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); a tax benefit of $34 million related to the remeasurement of our equity investment in CCE to fair value upon our acquisition of CCEs North American business. The tax benefit reflects the impact of reversing deferred tax liabilities associated with our equity investment in CCE prior to the acquisition (refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); an approximate 37 percent effective tax rate on charges related to preexisting relationships with CCE (refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); 70 an approximate 44 percent effective tax rate on the gain related to the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE (refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); an approximate 35 percent combined effective tax rate on the elimination of gross profit in inventory on intercompany sales and an inventory fair value adjustment as a result of our acquisition of CCEs North American business (refer to the heading "Gross Profit Margin," above); an approximate 37 percent combined effective tax rate on the amortization of favorable supply contracts acquired in connection with our acquisition and mark to market gains related to non designated hedges that are associated with underlying transactions expected to occur in a future period; an approximate 38 percent effective tax rate on the acceleration of expense associated with certain share based replacement awards issued in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business (refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); an approximate 4 percent combined effective tax rate on other than temporary impairments and a donation of preferred shares in one of our equity method investees (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); an approximate 33 percent combined effective tax rate on a charge related to the premiums paid to repurchase long term debt and the costs associated with the settlement of treasury rate locks issued in connection with the debt tender offer (refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); a zero percent effective tax rate on the remeasurement of our Venezuelan subsidiarys net assets (refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); an approximate 46 percent effective tax rate on the gain from the sale of 50 percent of our investment in Le&atilde;o Junior (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); an approximate 14 percent effective tax rate on our proportionate share of unusual tax charges, asset impairments, restructuring charges, transaction costs and a remeasurement gain recorded by equity method investees (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); a tax charge of approximately $14 million related to new legislation that changed the tax treatment of Medicare Part D subsidies (refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); a net tax charge of approximately $216 million, primarily related to deferred tax expense on certain current year undistributed foreign earnings that are not considered indefinitely reinvested (refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); and a net tax charge of approximately $67 million related to amounts required to be recorded for changes to our uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties (refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our effective tax rate of approximately 22.8 percent for the year ended December 31, 2009, included the following: an approximate 17 percent combined effective tax rate on restructuring charges, productivity initiatives and asset impairments (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); an approximate 21 percent combined effective tax rate on our proportionate share of restructuring and asset impairment charges recorded by equity method investees (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); a zero percent effective tax rate on an other than temporary impairment of a cost method investment (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); a zero percent effective tax rate on realized gains on sales of available for sale securities (refer to Note 3 and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); a tax benefit of approximately $17 million due to the impact that a tax rate change had on certain deferred tax liabilities (refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); 71 a tax charge of approximately $15 million related to the recognition of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets (refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); and a net tax benefit of approximately $13 million related to amounts required to be recorded for changes to our uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties (refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our effective tax rate of approximately 21.7 percent for the year ended December 31, 2008, included the following: an approximate 20 percent combined effective tax rate on restructuring charges, other than temporary impairments of available for sale securities, contract termination fees, productivity initiatives and asset impairments recorded by the Company (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); an approximate 23 percent combined effective tax rate on our proportionate share of asset impairment and restructuring charges recorded by equity method investees, primarily related to impairment charges recorded by CCE (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); an approximate 24 percent combined effective tax rate on gains from divestitures (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); a tax charge of approximately $10 million related to the recognition of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets (refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); and a net tax benefit of approximately $5 million, primarily related to amounts required to be recorded for changes to our uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties (refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). As of December 31, 2010, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was approximately $387 million. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the net effect would be a benefit to the Companys effective tax rate of approximately $163 million, exclusive of any benefits related to interest and penalties. The remaining approximately $224 million, which was recorded as a deferred tax asset, primarily represents tax benefits that would be received in different tax jurisdictions in the event that the Company did not prevail on all uncertain tax positions. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A reconciliation of the changes in the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefit amounts is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Beginning balance of unrecognized tax benefits $ 354 $ 369 $ 643 Increases related to prior period tax positions 26 49 52 Decreases related to prior period tax positions (10 ) (28 ) (4 ) Increases due to current period tax positions 33 16 47 Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities (27 ) (254 ) Reductions as a result of a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations (1 ) (73 ) (36 ) Increase due to acquisition of CCEs North American business 6 Increases (decreases) from effects of exchange rates (21 ) 48 (79 ) Ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits $ 387 $ 354 $ 369 In 2008, agreements were reached between the U.S. government and a foreign government concerning the allocation of income between the two tax jurisdictions. Pursuant to these agreements, we made cash payments during the third quarter of 2008 that constituted payments of tax and interest. These payments were partially offset by tax credits taken in the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2008, and tax refunds and interest on refunds received in 2009. These benefits had been recorded as deferred tax assets in prior periods. The settlements did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated income statement for the year ended December 31, 2008. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The Company had approximately $112 million, $94 million and $110 million in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Of these amounts, approximately $17 million, $16 million and $14 million of benefits were recognized through tax expense in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the reversal of this accrual would also be a benefit to the Companys effective tax rate. Based on current tax laws, the Companys effective tax rate in 2011 is expected to be approximately 23.5 percent to 24.5 percent before considering the effect of any unusual or special items that may affect our tax rate in future years. 72  Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position We believe our ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths. The near term outlook for our business remains strong, and we expect to generate substantial cash flows from operations in 2011. As a result of our expected strong cash flows from operations, we have significant flexibility to meet our financial commitments. We typically fund a significant portion of our dividends, capital expenditures, contractual obligations, share repurchases and acquisitions with cash generated from operating activities. We rely on external funding for additional cash requirements. The Company does not typically raise capital through the issuance of stock. Instead, we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase our return on shareowners equity. Refer to the heading "Cash Flows from Financing Activities," below. Our debt financing includes the use of an extensive commercial paper program as part of our overall cash management strategy. The Company reviews its optimal mix of short term and long term debt regularly. On October 2, 2010, we acquired CCEs North American business. Under the terms of the merger agreement, the Company acquired the 67 percent of CCEs North American business that was not already owned by the Company for consideration that included: (1) the Companys 33 percent indirect ownership interest in CCEs European operations; (2) cash consideration; and (3) replacement awards issued to certain current and former employees of CCEs North American and corporate operations. At closing, CCE shareowners other than the Company exchanged their CCE common stock for common stock in a new entity, which was renamed Coca Cola Enterprises, Inc. (which is referred to herein as "New CCE") and which continues to hold the European operations held by CCE prior to the acquisition. At closing, New CCE became 100 percent owned by shareowners that held shares of common stock of CCE immediately prior to the closing, other than the Company. As a result of this transaction, the Company does not own any interest in New CCE. Although the CCE transaction was structured to be primarily cashless, under the terms of the merger agreement, we agreed to assume approximately $8.9 billion of CCE debt. In the event that the actual CCE debt on the acquisition date was less than the agreed amount, we agreed to make a cash payment to New CCE for the difference. As of the acquisition date, the debt assumed by the Company was approximately $7.9 billion. The total cash consideration paid to New CCE as part of the transaction was approximately $1.3 billion, which included approximately $1.0 billion related to the debt shortfall. On November 15, 2010, the Company issued $4,500 million of long term notes and used some of the proceeds to repurchase $2,910 million of long term debt. The remaining cash from the issuance was used to reduce our outstanding commercial paper balance. The Company recorded a charge of $342 million related to the premiums paid to repurchase the long term debt and the costs associated with the settlement of treasury rate locks issued in connection with the debt tender offer. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the Companys long term debt. In a concurrent transaction, we sold all of our ownership interests in our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE for approximately $0.9 billion in cash on October 2, 2010. The Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations were wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company prior to the divestiture. This divestiture was pursuant to the terms of the definitive agreement entered into on March 20, 2010. In addition, we granted New CCE the right to acquire our majority interest in CCEAG, 18 to 39 months after the date of the merger agreement, at the then current fair value and subject to terms and conditions as mutually agreed. In contemplation of the closing of our acquisition of CCEs North American business, we reached an agreement with DPS to distribute certain DPS brands in territories where DPS brands had been distributed by CCE prior to the CCE transaction. Under the terms of our agreement with DPS, concurrently with the closing of the CCE transaction, we entered into license agreements with DPS to distribute Dr Pepper trademark brands in the U.S., Canada Dry in the Northeast U.S., and Canada Dry and C Plus in Canada, and we made a net one time cash payment of $715 million to DPS. Under the license agreements, the Company agreed to meet certain performance obligations to distribute DPS products in retail and foodservice accounts and vending machines. The license agreements have initial terms of 20 years, with automatic 20 year renewal periods unless otherwise terminated under the terms of the agreements. The license agreements replaced agreements between DPS and CCE existing immediately prior to the completion of the CCE transaction. In addition, we entered into an agreement with DPS to include Dr Pepper and Diet Dr Pepper in our Coca Cola Freestyle fountain dispensers in certain outlets throughout the United States. The Coca Cola Freestyle agreement has a term of 20 years. 73 The Company contributed $77 million to our pension plans during the year ended December 31, 2010. In 2011, we expect to contribute $800 million to various plans, of which approximately $750 million was contributed in the first quarter of 2011. Approximately half of the expected 2011 contributions will be allocated to our primary U.S. pension plans. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The government in Venezuela has enacted certain monetary policies that restrict the ability of companies to pay dividends from retained earnings. As of December 31, 2010, cash held by our Venezuelan subsidiary accounted for approximately 2 percent of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance. In the first quarter of 2010 the Venezuelan government announced a currency devaluation and Venezuela was determined to be a hyperinflationary economy. As a result, our local subsidiary was required to use the U.S. dollar as its functional currency, and we recorded a net remeasurement loss of $103 million during the first quarter of 2010 in the line item other income (loss) net in our consolidated statement of income. As of December 31, 2010, our Venezuelan subsidiary held monetary assets of approximately $200 million. In addition to the foreign currency exchange exposure related to our Venezuelan subsidiarys net assets, we also sell concentrate to our bottling partner in Venezuela from outside the country. These sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Some of our concentrate sales were approved by the CADIVI to receive the official rate for essential goods of 2.6 bolivars per U.S. dollar prior to the elimination of the official rate for essential goods in December 2010. Prior to the elimination of the official rate for essential goods, our bottling partner in Venezuela was able to convert bolivars to U.S. dollars to settle our receivables related to sales approved by the CADIVI. Therefore, as of December 31, 2010, our receivable balance related to concentrate sales that had been approved by the CADIVI was not significant. If we are unable to utilize a government approved exchange rate mechanism for future concentrate sales to our bottling partner in Venezuela, the amount of receivables related to these sales will increase. In addition to the Companys cash balances and commercial paper program, we also maintain $4,850 million in lines of credit for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backup, of which approximately $4,597 million was unused and available as of December 31, 2010. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These backup lines of credit expire at various times from 2011 through 2012. These credit facilities are subject to normal banking terms and conditions. Some of the financial arrangements require compensating balances, none of which is presently significant to our Company. We have evaluated the financial stability of each bank and believe we can access the funds, if needed. Based on all the aforementioned factors, the Company believes its current liquidity position is strong, and we will continue to meet all our financial commitments for the foreseeable future. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $9,532 million, $8,186 million and $7,571 million, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities increased $1,346 million, or 16 percent, in 2010 compared to 2009. This increase was primarily attributable to increased receipts from customers, the impact of our acquisition of CCEs North American business, the favorable impact of exchange rates on operations and a decrease in contributions to our pension plans. The impact of these items was partially offset by higher tax payments in 2010. The increase in cash receipts from customers was primarily due to an increase in net operating revenues. Refer to the heading "Net Operating Revenues," above. Also, in 2009, cash flows from operating activities included the receipt of a $183 million special dividend from Coca Cola Hellenic. The Company contributed approximately $77 million to our pension plans during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $269 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. Cash flows from operating activities increased $615 million, or 8 percent, in 2009 compared to 2008. This increase was primarily attributable to lower tax payments, decreased payments to suppliers and vendors, and the receipt of a $183 million special dividend from Coca Cola Hellenic. The special dividend received from Coca Cola Hellenic was incremental to its normal quarterly dividend. We classified the receipt of this special dividend in cash flows from operating activities due to the fact that our cumulative equity in earnings from Coca Cola Hellenic exceeded the cumulative distributions received; therefore, the special dividend was deemed to be a return on our investment and not a return of our investment. The impact of these items was partially offset by increased contributions to our pension plans. The increase in contributions to our pension plans was primarily due to the decline in fair value of our pension 74 plan assets in 2008. The Company contributed approximately $269 million to our pension plans during the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to approximately $96 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Our cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities are summarized as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Purchases of short term investments $ (4,579 ) $ (2,130 ) $ Proceeds from disposals of short term investments 4,032 Acquisitions and investments (2,511 ) (300 ) (759 ) Purchases of other investments (132 ) (22 ) (240 ) Proceeds from disposals of bottling companies and other investments 972 240 479 Purchases of property, plant and equipment (2,215 ) (1,993 ) (1,968 ) Proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment 134 104 129 Other investing activities (106 ) (48 ) (4 ) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (4,405 ) $ (4,149 ) $ (2,363 ) Short term Investments In 2010, purchases of short term investments were $4,579 million, and proceeds from disposals of short term investments were $4,032 million. This activity resulted in a net cash outflow of $547 million during the year. In 2009, purchases of short term investments were $2,130 million. These short term investments are time deposits that have maturities of greater than three months but less than one year, and are classified in the line item short term investments in our consolidated balance sheets. The Company began investing in longer term time deposits during the fourth quarter of 2009 to match the maturities of short term debt issued as part of our commercial paper program. Refer to the heading "Cash Flows from Financing Activities," below. These time deposits are classified in the line item short term investments in our consolidated balance sheets. Acquisitions and Investments In 2010, the Companys acquisition and investment activities totaled $2,511 million, which was primarily related to our acquisition of CCEs North American business, DPS license agreements, our acquisition of OAO Nidan Juices ("Nidan"), a Russian juice company, and our additional investment in Fresh Trading Ltd. ("innocent"). The Company and the existing shareowners of innocent have a series of outstanding put and call options for the Company to potentially acquire the remaining shares not already owned by the Company. The put and call options are exercisable in stages between 2013 and 2014. Refer to the heading "Operations Review Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements," and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our acquisitions during the year. In 2009, our Companys acquisition and investment activities totaled $300 million. None of the acquisitions or investments was individually significant. Included in these investment activities was the acquisition of a minority interest in innocent. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our acquisitions during the year. In 2008, our Companys acquisition and investment activities totaled $759 million, which included the acquisition of brands and licenses in Denmark and Finland from Carlsberg Group Beverages for approximately $225 million. None of the other acquisitions during 2008 was individually significant. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Proceeds from Disposals of Bottling Companies and Other Investments In 2010, proceeds from disposals of bottling companies and other investments were $972 million. These proceeds were primarily related to the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE for approximately $0.9 billion and the sale of 50 percent of our investment in Le&atilde;o Junior for approximately $83 million. Refer to the 75 heading "Operations Review Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements," and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In 2008, proceeds from disposals of bottling companies and other investments included proceeds of approximately $275 million, net of the cash balance as of the disposal date, related to the sale of Remil to Coca Cola FEMSA. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchases of Property, Plant and Equipment Net Purchases of property, plant and equipment net of disposals for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were approximately $2,081 million, $1,889 million and $1,839 million, respectively. The increase in 2010 compared to 2009 and 2008 was primarily attributable to the acquisition of CCEs North American business. Refer to the heading "Operations Review Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements." Generally, bottling and finished products operations are more capital intensive compared to concentrate and syrup operations. Total capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment (including our investments in information technology) and the percentage of such totals by operating segment were as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Capital expenditures $ 2,215 $ 1,993 $ 1,968 Eurasia & Africa 2.7 % 3.5 % 3.4 % Europe 1.5 3.4 3.9 Latin America 4.2 6.2 2.9 North America 32.1 23.0 25.0 Pacific 4.6 4.6 9.0 Bottling Investments 42.5 41.4 41.6 Corporate 12.4 17.9 14.2 In 2011, our annual capital expenditures will increase as we integrate CCEs North American business and make investments to further enhance our operational effectiveness. The net result of these North America specific expenditures will result in an estimated increase of $1.0 billion to our 2011 capital expenditure program. In addition, we plan to make further strategic investments in 2011, primarily related to expanding our production and sales capabilities within our Bottling Investments operating segment. As a result, we expect our annual 2011 capital expenditures to range between $3.0 billion and $3.2 billion. We currently expect this level of capital expenditure to remain relatively constant for the next two years, but anticipate these levels to decrease over time. Other Investing Activities In 2010, other investing activities primarily related to the impact of the deconsolidation of certain entities due to the Companys adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. Refer to the heading "Operations Review Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements," and Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The cash flow impact in other investing activities primarily represents the balance of cash and cash equivalents on the deconsolidated entities balance sheets as of December 31, 2009. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Our cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities were as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Issuances of debt $ 15,251 $ 14,689 $ 4,337 Payments of debt (13,403 ) (12,326 ) (4,308 ) Issuances of stock 1,666 664 595 Purchases of stock for treasury (2,961 ) (1,518 ) (1,079 ) Dividends (4,068 ) (3,800 ) (3,521 ) Other financing activities 50 (2 ) (9 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (3,465 ) $ (2,293 ) $ (3,985 ) 76 Debt Financing Our Company maintains debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flows, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. We use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners equity. This exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. Our interest expense may also be affected by our credit ratings. As of December 31, 2010, our long term debt was rated "A+" by Standard & Poors, "Aa3" by Moodys and "A+" by Fitch. Our commercial paper program was rated "A 1" by Standard & Poors, "P 1" by Moodys and "F 1" by Fitch. In assessing our credit strength, all three agencies consider our capital structure (including the amount and maturity dates of our debt) and financial policies as well as the aggregated balance sheet and other financial information for the Company. In addition, some rating agencies also consider financial information for certain bottlers, including New CCE, Coca Cola Amatil, Coca Cola FEMSA and Coca Cola Hellenic. While the Company has no legal obligation for the debt of these bottlers, the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the Companys business model provides the Company with an incentive to keep these bottlers viable. It is our expectation that the credit rating agencies will continue using this methodology. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure, our major bottlers financial performance, changes in the credit rating agencies methodology in assessing our credit strength, or for any other reason, our cost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if certain bottlers credit ratings were to decline, the Companys share of equity income could be reduced as a result of the potential increase in interest expense for these bottlers. We monitor our financial ratios and, as indicated above, the rating agencies consider these ratios in assessing our credit ratings. Each rating agency employs a different aggregation methodology and has different thresholds for the various financial ratios. These thresholds are not necessarily permanent, nor are they always fully disclosed to our Company. Our global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the world, enabling us to raise funds at a low effective cost. This posture, coupled with active management of our mix of short term and long term debt and our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt, results in a lower overall cost of borrowing. Our debt management policies, in conjunction with our share repurchase programs and investment activity, can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets. Issuances and payments of debt included both short term and long term financing activities. On December 31, 2010, we had $4,850 million in lines of credit available for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backup, of which approximately $4,597 million was unused and available. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These backup lines of credit expire at various times from 2011 through 2012. In 2010, the Company had issuances of debt of $15,251 million, which included $1,171 million of net issuances of commercial paper and short term debt with maturities of 90 days or less and $9,503 million of issuances of commercial paper and short term debt with maturities greater than 90 days. In addition, on November 15, 2010, the Company issued $4,500 million of long term notes. The proceeds from the debt issuance were used to repurchase $2,910 million of long term debt, and the remainder was used to reduce our commercial paper balance. The long term notes issued on November 15, 2010, had the following general terms: $1,250 million total principal notes due May 15, 2012, at a variable interest rate of 3 month LIBOR plus 0.05 percent; $1,250 million total principal notes due November 15, 2013, at a fixed interest rate of 0.75 percent; $1,000 million total principal notes due November 15, 2015, at a fixed interest rate of 1.5 percent; and $1,000 million total principal notes due November 15, 2020, at a fixed interest rate of 3.15 percent. In 2010, the Company had payments of debt of $13,403 million, including the repurchased long term debt discussed above. Total payments of debt also included $9,667 million related to commercial paper and short term debt with maturities greater than 90 days. The Company recorded a charge of $342 million related to the premiums paid to repurchase the long term debt and the costs associated with the settlement of treasury rate locks issued in connection with the debt tender offer. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the Companys long term debt. 77  In 2009, the Company had issuances of debt of approximately $14,689 million and payments of debt of $12,326 million. The issuances of debt included approximately $12,397 million of issuances of commercial paper and short term debt with maturities greater than 90 days, as well as $900 million and $1,350 million of long term debt due March 15, 2014, and March 15, 2019, respectively. The payments of debt included approximately $1,861 million of net payments of commercial paper and short term debt with maturities of 90 days or less; $10,017 million related to commercial paper and short term debt with maturities greater than 90 days; and $448 million related to long term debt. The increase in issuances and payments of commercial paper with maturities of greater than 90 days was primarily due to a favorable interest rate environment on longer term commercial paper. As a result, the Company also began investing in longer term time deposits that have maturities of greater than three months. Refer to the heading "Cash Flows from Investing Activities." The issuances of debt in 2008 included approximately $4,001 million of issuances of commercial paper and short term debt with maturities of greater than 90 days, and approximately $194 million of net issuances of commercial paper and short term debt with maturities of 90 days or less. The payments of debt in 2008 included approximately $4,032 million related to commercial paper and short term debt with maturities of greater than 90 days. Issuances of Stock The issuances of stock in 2010, 2009 and 2008 primarily related to the exercise of stock options by Company employees. Share Repurchases On July 20, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a share repurchase program of up to 300 million shares of the Companys common stock. The program took effect on October 31, 2006. The table below presents annual shares repurchased and average price per share: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Number of shares repurchased (in millions) 49 26 18 Average price per share $ 63.85 $ 57.09 $ 58.01 Since the inception of our initial share repurchase program in 1984 through our current program as of December 31, 2010, we have purchased approximately 1.4 billion shares of our Companys common stock at an average price per share of $21.37. In addition to shares repurchased under the stock repurchase plans authorized by our Board of Directors, the Companys treasury stock activity also includes shares surrendered to the Company to pay the exercise price and or to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with so called stock swap exercises of employee stock options and or the vesting of restricted stock issued to employees. In 2010, we repurchased approximately $3.1 billion of our stock, of which $3.0 billion settled prior to December 31, 2010. We currently expect to repurchase an additional $2.0 billion to $2.5 billion of our stock during 2011. Dividends At its February 2011 meeting, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 7 percent, raising it to $0.47 per share, equivalent to a full year dividend of $1.88 per share in 2011. This is our 49th consecutive annual increase. Our annual common stock dividend was $1.76 per share, $1.64 per share and $1.52 per share in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The 2010 dividend represented a 7 percent increase from 2009, and the 2009 dividend represented an 8 percent increase from 2008. 78 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In accordance with the definition under SEC rules, the following qualify as off balance sheet arrangements: any obligation under certain guarantee contracts; a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets; any obligation under certain derivative instruments; and any obligation arising out of a material variable interest held by the registrant in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the registrant, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the registrant. As of December 31, 2010, we were contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties of approximately $683 million, of which approximately $336 million related to VIEs. These guarantees primarily are related to third party customers, bottlers, vendors and container manufacturing operations and have arisen through the normal course of business. These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees was individually significant. The amount represents the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make under the guarantees; however, we do not consider it probable that we will be required to satisfy these guarantees. Management concluded that the likelihood of any significant amounts being paid by our Company under these guarantees is not probable. As of December 31, 2010, we were not directly liable for the debt of any unconsolidated entity, and we did not have any retained or contingent interest in assets as defined above. Our Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had $4,850 million in lines of credit for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backup, of which $4,597 million was unused and available. While no amounts have been borrowed against these lines of credit, certain portions have been limited due to outstanding letters of credit related to collateral for claims incurred under our self insurance programs and for certain operating activities. These backup lines of credit expire at various times from 2011 through 2012. These credit facilities are subject to normal banking terms and conditions. Some of the financial arrangements require compensating balances, none of which is presently significant to our Company. 79 Aggregate Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2010, the Companys contractual obligations, including payments due by period, were as follows (in millions): Payments Due by Period Total 2011 20122013 20142015 2016 and Thereafter Short term loans and notes payable1: Commercial paper borrowings $ 7,535 $ 7,535 $ $ $ Lines of credit and other short term borrowings 565 565 Current maturities of long term debt2 1,266 1,266 Long term debt, net of current maturities2 13,076 3,800 3,392 5,884 Estimated interest payments3 7,686 696 1,282 1,027 4,681 Accrued income taxes4 273 273 Purchase obligations5 12,463 7,615 2,628 1,053 1,167 Marketing obligations6 4,557 1,652 1,691 468 746 Lease obligations 1,155 238 386 218 313 Total contractual obligations4 $ 48,576 $ 19,840 $ 9,787 $ 6,158 $ 12,791 1 Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding short term loans and notes payable. Upon payment of outstanding commercial paper, we typically issue new commercial paper. Lines of credit and other short term borrowings are expected to fluctuate depending upon current liquidity needs, especially at international subsidiaries. 2 Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding long term debt. We will consider several alternatives to settle this long term debt, including the use of cash flows from operating activities, issuance of commercial paper or issuance of other long term debt. 3 We calculated estimated interest payments for our long term fixed rate debt based on the applicable rates and payment dates. We typically expect to settle such interest payments with cash flows from operating activities and or short term borrowings. 4 Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding income taxes. As of December 31, 2010, the noncurrent portion of our income tax liability, including accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, was approximately $474 million, which was not included in the total above. At this time, the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of our income tax liability cannot be determined. In addition, any payments related to unrecognized tax benefits would be partially offset by reductions in payments in other jurisdictions. 5 Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including long term contractual obligations, open purchase orders, accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities. We expect to fund these obligations with cash flows from operating activities. 6 We expect to fund these marketing obligations with cash flows from operating activities. The total accrued benefit liability for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of December 31, 2010, was approximately $2,563 million. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This amount is impacted by, among other items, pension expense, funding levels, plan amendments, changes in plan demographics and assumptions, and the investment return on plan assets. Because the accrued liability does not represent expected liquidity needs, we did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 ("PPA") was enacted in August 2006 and established, among other things, new standards for funding of U.S. defined benefit pension plans. During 2008, the funded status of the Companys primary U.S. defined benefit pension plan declined as a result of the overall stock market decline. In early 2009, the Company contributed approximately $175 million to this plan. Subsequent to this contribution, the plan is sufficiently funded to maintain maximum flexibility as outlined in the PPA. We generally expect to fund all future contributions with cash flows from operating activities. Our international pension plans are generally funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations. In 2011, we expect to contribute approximately $800 million to various plans, of which approximately $750 million was contributed in the first quarter of 2011. Approximately half of the expected 2011 contributions will be allocated to our primary U.S. pension plans. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We did not include our estimated contributions to our various plans in the table above. As of December 31, 2010, the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. qualified pension plans was $4,837 million, and the fair value of plan assets was approximately $4,118 million. The majority of this underfunding was due to the negative impact that the recent credit crisis and financial system instability had on the value of our pension plan assets. 80 As of December 31, 2010, the projected benefit obligation of all pension plans other than the U.S. qualified pension plans was approximately $2,455 million, and the fair value of all other pension plan assets was approximately $1,379 million. The majority of this underfunding is attributable to an international pension plan for certain non U.S. employees that is unfunded due to tax law restrictions, as well as our unfunded U.S. nonqualified pension plans. These U.S. nonqualified pension plans provide, for certain associates, benefits that are not permitted to be funded through a qualified plan because of limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The expected benefit payments for these unfunded pension plans are not included in the table above. However, we anticipate annual benefit payments for these unfunded pension plans to be approximately $50 million in 2011 and remain near that level through 2030, decreasing annually thereafter. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In general, we are self insured for large portions of many different types of claims; however, we do use commercial insurance above our self insured retentions to reduce the Companys risk of catastrophic loss. Our reserves for the Companys self insured losses are estimated through actuarial procedures of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions, adjusted for our specific expectations based on our claim history. As of December 31, 2010, our self insurance reserves totaled approximately $502 million. Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We did not include estimated payments related to our self insurance reserves in the table above. Deferred income tax liabilities as of December 31, 2010, were approximately $4,279 million. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This amount is not included in the total contractual obligations table because we believe this presentation would not be meaningful. Deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective book bases, which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts. The results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods. As a result, scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading, because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs. Foreign Exchange Our international operations are subject to certain opportunities and risks, including currency fluctuations and governmental actions. We closely monitor our operations in each country and seek to adopt appropriate strategies that are responsive to changing economic and political environments, and to fluctuations in foreign currencies. We use 75 functional currencies. Due to our global operations, weakness in some of these currencies might be offset by strength in others. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, the weighted average exchange rates for foreign currencies in which the Company conducted operations (all operating currencies), and for certain individual currencies, strengthened (weakened) against the U.S. dollar as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 All operating currencies 3 % (9 )% 5 % Brazilian real 11 % (8 )% 6 % Mexican peso 6 (24 ) 0 Australian dollar 13 (8 ) 1 South African rand 11 (1 ) (18 ) British pound (2 ) (18 ) (9 ) Euro (5 ) (8 ) 9 Japanese yen 6 9 12 These percentages do not include the effects of our hedging activities and, therefore, do not reflect the actual impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on our operating results. Our foreign currency management program is designed to mitigate, over time, a portion of the impact of exchange rate changes on our net income and earnings per share. The total currency impact on operating income, including the effect of our hedging activities, was an increase of approximately 3 percent in 2010 and a decrease of approximately 11 percent in 2009. Based on the anticipated impact of hedging coverage in place, the Company expects currencies to have an even to slightly positive impact on operating income for the first quarter and full year of 2011. 81 Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies. The effects of the remeasurement of these assets and liabilities are partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are included as a component of other income (loss) net in our consolidated financial statements. Refer to the heading "Operations Review Other Income (Loss) Net." The Company recorded foreign currency losses of $148 million and $34 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company recorded a foreign currency gain of $24 million in 2008. The remeasurement loss recorded in 2010 was primarily related to our Venezuelan subsidiary. Subsequent to December 31, 2009, the Venezuelan government announced a currency devaluation, and Venezuela was determined to be a hyperinflationary economy. As a result, our local subsidiary was required to use the U.S. dollar as its functional currency and we recorded a net remeasurement loss of approximately $103 million during the first quarter of 2010, in the line item other income (loss) net in our consolidated statement of income. The Company will continue to manage its foreign currency exposure to mitigate, over time, a portion of the impact of exchange rate changes on net income and earnings per share. 82  Overview of Financial Position In 2010, the Company had a number of significant transactions and events that impacted our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to the heading "Operations Review Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements," for additional information related to these transactions and events. The most significant impact on our consolidated balance sheet was related to our acquisition of CCEs North American business, which resulted in the Company recording total assets of approximately $22.2 billion as of the acquisition date. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a preliminary allocation of the purchase price by major class of assets and liabilities. The majority of the fluctuations in individual line items in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2010, compared to our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2009, were attributable to this acquisition. The following table illustrates the change in the individual line items of the Companys consolidated balance sheet (in millions): December 31, 2010 2009 Change Cash and cash equivalents $ 8,517 $ 7,021 $ 1,496 Short term investments 2,682 2,130 552 Marketable securities 138 62 76 Trade accounts receivable net 4,430 3,758 672 Inventories 2,650 2,354 296 Prepaid expenses and other assets 3,162 2,226 936 Equity method investments 6,954 6,217 737 Other investments, principally bottling companies 631 538 93 Other assets 2,121 1,976 145 Property, plant and equipment net 14,727 9,561 5,166 Trademarks with indefinite lives 6,356 6,183 173 Bottlers franchise rights with indefinite lives 7,511 1,953 5,558 Goodwill 11,665 4,224 7,441 Other intangible assets 1,377 468 909 Total assets $ 72,921 $ 48,671 $ 24,250 Accounts payable and accrued expenses $ 8,859 $ 6,657 $ 2,202 Loans and notes payable 8,100 6,749 1,351 Current maturities of long term debt 1,276 51 1,225 Accrued income taxes 273 264 9 Long term debt 14,041 5,059 8,982 Other liabilities 4,794 2,965 1,829 Deferred income taxes 4,261 1,580 2,681 Total liabilities 41,604 23,325 18,279 Net assets $ 31,317 $ 25,346 $ 5,971 1 1 Includes a decrease in net assets of $947 million resulting from translation adjustments in various balance sheet accounts. The table above includes the impact of the following transactions and events: Property, plant and equipment net increased $5,166 million, primarily due to the $5,385 million of property, plant and equipment acquired in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business. The impact of this acquisition was partially offset by a decrease of $315 million due to the disposal of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations and a decrease of $400 million related to the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of our adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. Refer to Note 1 and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Bottlers franchise rights with indefinite lives increased $5,558 million, primarily due to the $5,100 million of indefinite lived franchise rights we reacquired in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business and $865 million related to DPS license agreements. The impact of the previously mentioned items was partially offset by the impact of the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of our adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. Goodwill increased $7,441 million, primarily due to $7,746 million of goodwill recognized in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business. The acquired goodwill was partially offset by the impact of the 83 deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of our adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB and the disposal of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations. Refer to Note 1 and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other intangible assets increased $909 million, primarily due to $605 million of definite lived franchise rights and $380 million of customer rights we acquired in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased $2,202 million, primarily due to the $1,826 million of accounts payable and accrued expenses assumed in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase also reflects additional accrued liabilities related to our stock repurchase program for shares purchased but not settled as of December 31, 2010. Loans and notes payable increased $1,351 million, primarily related to an increase in short term borrowings to fund the cash payment made in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Current maturities of long term debt increased $1,225 million, primarily related to an increase in our overall debt balance as a result of our acquisition of CCEs North American business. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Long term debt increased $8,982 million, primarily due to long term debt assumed in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business. Refer to the heading "Cash Flows from Financing Activities," above, and Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other liabilities increased $1,829 million, primarily due to pension and other postretirement liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business. The assumed liabilities consisted of benefit obligations of $3,544 million and plan assets of $2,231 million as of the acquisition date. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to pension and other postretirement plans assumed from CCE. Deferred income taxes increased $2,681 million, primarily due to deferred tax liabilities recorded on the franchise rights acquired in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices Inflation affects the way we operate in many markets around the world. In general, we believe that, over time, we are able to increase prices to counteract the majority of the inflationary effects of increasing costs and to generate sufficient cash flows to maintain our productive capability. 84   ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and other market risks. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. As a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure. Because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure, fluctuations in the value of the instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure. The Company generally hedges anticipated exposures up to 36 months in advance; however, the majority of our derivative instruments expire within 24 months or less. Virtually all of our derivatives are straightforward over the counter instruments with liquid markets. We monitor our exposure to financial market risks using several objective measurement systems. In prior years, the Company primarily used the value at risk methodology for its quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. However, with the Companys acquisition of CCEs North American business in 2010, and the related changes to our consolidated balance sheet, the Company has provided a sensitivity analysis to measure our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and commodity prices. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our hedging transactions and derivative financial instruments. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates We manage most of our foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows us to net certain exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets. In 2010, we generated approximately 70 percent of our net operating revenues from operations outside the United States; therefore, weakness in one particular currency might be offset by strengths in other currencies over time. We use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to currency fluctuations. Our Company enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases currency options (principally euro and Japanese yen) and collars to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. Additionally, we enter into forward exchange contracts to offset the earnings impact related to exchange rate fluctuations on certain monetary assets and liabilities. We also enter into forward exchange contracts as hedges of net investments in international operations. The total notional value of our foreign currency derivatives was $6.3 billion and $4.6 billion as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. This total includes derivative instruments that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting as well as economic hedges. The fair value of the contracts that qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a liability of $109 million as of December 31, 2010. At the end of 2010, we estimate that an unfavorable 10 percent change in the exchange rates would have increased our net unrealized losses by $395 million. Likewise, the fair value of the contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a liability of $79 million, and we estimate that an unfavorable 10 percent change in rates would have increased our net losses by $244 million. All losses were offset by changes in the underlying hedged item, resulting in no net material impact on earnings. Interest Rates We monitor our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt, as well as our mix of short term debt versus long term debt. From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt. Based on the Companys variable rate debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2010, a 1 percentage point increase versus the market interest rates available on December 31, 2010 would result in an additional $123 million of interest expense. However, the impact to our consolidated statement of income would have been partially offset by the increase in interest income related to higher interest rates. Commodity Prices The Company is subject to market risk with respect to commodity price fluctuations, principally related to our purchases of aluminum and plastic, sweeteners, and energy. Whenever possible, we manage our exposure to commodity risks primarily through the use of supplier pricing agreements that enable us to establish the purchase prices for certain inputs that are used in our manufacturing and distribution business. We also use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to commodity risks at times. Certain of these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, but 85 they are effective economic hedges that help the Company mitigate the price risk associated with the purchases of materials used in our manufacturing processes and the fuel used to operate our extensive vehicle fleet. Open commodity derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting had a notional value of $28 million as of December 31, 2010. These contracts had a fair value of $2 million. The potential change in fair value of these commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10 percent decrease in underlying commodity prices, would have eliminated the net unrealized gain and created an unrealized loss of $2 million. Open commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting had a notional value of $425 million as of December 31, 2010. These contracts had a fair value of $56 million. The potential change in fair value of these commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10 percent decrease in underlying commodity prices, would have reduced our net gain by $31 million. 86

We own or license and market more than 500 nonalcoholic beverage brands, primarily sparkling beverages but also a variety of still beverages such as waters, enhanced waters, juices and juice drinks, ready to drink teas and coffees, and energy and sports drinks. Along with Coca Cola, which is recognized as the worlds most valuable brand, we own and market four of the worlds top five nonalcoholic sparkling beverage brands, including Diet Coke, Fanta and Sprite. Finished beverage products bearing our trademarks, sold in the United States since 1886, are now sold in more than 200 countries. We make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of Company owned or controlled bottling and distribution operations, bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers the worlds largest beverage distribution system. Of the approximately 55 billion beverage servings of all types consumed worldwide every day, beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us account for approximately 1.7 billion. We believe that our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide variety of choices to meet their desires, needs and lifestyle choices. Our success further depends on the ability of our people to execute effectively, every day. Our goal is to use our Companys assets our brands, financial strength, unrivaled distribution system, global reach and the talent and strong commitment of our management and associates to become more competitive and to accelerate growth in a manner that creates value for our shareowners. Our Company markets, manufactures and sells: beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as "beverage bases," and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our "concentrate business" or "concentrate operations"); and finished sparkling and still beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our "finished products business" or "finished products operations"). Generally, finished products operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations. In our concentrate operations, we typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to authorized bottling and canning operations (to which we typically refer as our "bottlers" or our "bottling partners"). Our bottling partners either combine the concentrates with sweeteners (depending on the product), still water and or sparkling water or combine the syrups with sparkling water to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us such as cans and refillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through wholesalers or other bottlers. Outside the United States, we also sell concentrates for fountain beverages to our bottling partners who are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, which they sell to fountain retailers such as restaurants and convenience stores which use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. Our finished products operations consist primarily of the production, sales and distribution operations managed by CCR and our Company owned or controlled bottling and distribution operations. CCR is included in our North America operating segment, and our Company owned or controlled bottling and distribution operations are included in our Bottling Investments operating segment. Our finished products operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling beverages and a variety of still beverages, such as juices and juice drinks, energy and sports drinks, ready to drink teas and coffees, and certain water products, to retailers or to distributors, wholesalers and bottling partners who distribute them to retailers. In addition, in the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers such as restaurants and convenience stores who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. In the United States, we authorize wholesalers to resell our fountain syrups through nonexclusive appointments that neither restrict us in setting the prices at which we sell fountain syrups to the wholesalers nor restrict the territories in which the wholesalers may resell in the United States. 34 The following table sets forth the percentage of total net operating revenues related to concentrate operations and finished products operations, respectively: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Concentrate operations1 51 % 54 % 54 % Finished products operations2 49 3 46 46 Net operating revenues 100 % 100 % 100 % 1 Includes concentrates sold by the Company to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of fountain syrups. The bottlers then typically sell the fountain syrups to wholesalers or directly to fountain retailers. 2 Includes fountain syrups manufactured by the Company, including consolidated bottling operations, and sold to fountain retailers or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. 3 Includes net operating revenues related to the acquired CCE North American business from October 2, 2010. The following table sets forth the percentage of total worldwide unit case volume related to concentrate operations and finished products operations, respectively: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Concentrate operations1 76 % 78 % 77 % Finished products operations2 24 3 22 23 Total worldwide unit case volume 100 % 100 % 100 % 1 Includes unit case volume related to concentrates sold by the Company to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of fountain syrups. The bottlers then typically sell the fountain syrups to wholesalers or directly to fountain retailers. 2 Includes unit case volume related to fountain syrups manufactured by the Company, including consolidated bottling operations, and sold to fountain retailers or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. 3 Includes unit case volume related to the acquired CCE North American business from October 2, 2010. Acquisition of CCEs North American Business and Related Transactions Pursuant to the terms of the business separation and merger agreement entered into on February 25, 2010, as amended (the "merger agreement"), on October 2, 2010 (the "acquisition date"), we acquired CCEs North American business, consisting of CCEs production, sales and distribution operations in the United States, Canada, the British Virgin Islands, the United States Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands, and a substantial majority of CCEs corporate segment. We believe this acquisition will result in an evolved franchise system that will enable us to better serve the unique needs of the North American market. The creation of a unified operating system will strategically position us to better market and distribute our nonalcoholic beverage brands in North America. Under the terms of the merger agreement, the Company acquired the 67 percent of CCEs North American business that was not already owned by the Company for consideration that included: (1) the Companys 33 percent indirect ownership interest in CCEs European operations; (2) cash consideration; and (3) replacement awards issued to certain current and former employees of CCEs North American and corporate operations. At closing, CCE shareowners other than the Company exchanged their CCE common stock for common stock in a new entity, which was renamed Coca Cola Enterprises, Inc. (which is referred to herein as "New CCE") and which continues to hold the European operations held by CCE prior to the acquisition. At closing, New CCE became 100 percent owned by shareowners that held shares of common stock of CCE immediately prior to the closing, other than the Company. As a result of this transaction, the Company does not own any interest in New CCE. As of October 1, 2010, our Company owned approximately 33 percent of the outstanding common stock of CCE. Based on the closing price of CCEs common stock on the last day of trading prior to the acquisition date, the fair value of our investment in CCE was approximately $5,373 million, which reflected the fair value of our ownership in both CCEs North American business and its European operations. We remeasured our equity interest in CCE to fair value upon 35 the close of the transaction. As a result, we recognized a gain of approximately $4,978 million, which was classified in the line item other income (loss) net in our consolidated statement of income. The gain included a $137 million reclassification adjustment related to foreign currency translation gains recognized upon the disposal of our indirect investment in CCEs European operations. The Company relinquished its indirect ownership interest in CCEs European operations to New CCE as part of the consideration to acquire the 67 percent of CCEs North American business that was not already owned by the Company. Although the CCE transaction was structured to be primarily cashless, under the terms of the merger agreement, we agreed to assume approximately $8.9 billion of CCE debt. In the event that the actual CCE debt on the acquisition date was less than the agreed amount, we agreed to make a cash payment to New CCE for the difference. As of the acquisition date, the debt assumed by the Company was approximately $7.9 billion. The total cash consideration paid to New CCE as part of the transaction was approximately $1.3 billion, which included approximately $1.0 billion related to the debt shortfall. In contemplation of the closing of our acquisition of CCEs North American business, we reached an agreement with DPS to distribute certain DPS brands in territories where DPS brands had been distributed by CCE prior to the CCE transaction. Under the terms of our agreement with DPS, concurrently with the closing of the CCE transaction, we entered into license agreements with DPS to distribute Dr Pepper trademark brands in the U.S., Canada Dry in the Northeast U.S., and Canada Dry and C Plus in Canada, and we made a net one time cash payment of $715 million to DPS. Under the license agreements, the Company agreed to meet certain performance obligations to distribute DPS products in retail and foodservice accounts and vending machines. The license agreements have initial terms of 20 years, with automatic 20 year renewal periods unless otherwise terminated under the terms of the agreements. The license agreements replaced agreements between DPS and CCE existing immediately prior to the completion of the CCE transaction. In addition, we entered into an agreement with DPS to include Dr Pepper and Diet Dr Pepper in our Coca Cola Freestyle fountain dispensers in certain outlets throughout the United States. The Coca Cola Freestyle agreement has a term of 20 years. On October 2, 2010, we sold all of our ownership interests in our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE for approximately $0.9 billion in cash. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of CCEs North American business, we granted to New CCE the right to acquire our majority interest in our German bottler at any time from 18 to 39 months after February 25, 2010, at the then current fair value and subject to terms and conditions as mutually agreed. The Nonalcoholic Beverages Segment of the Commercial Beverages Industry We operate in the highly competitive nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry. We face strong competition from numerous other general and specialty beverage companies. We, along with other beverage companies, are affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, cost to manufacture and distribute products, consumer spending, economic conditions, availability and quality of water, consumer preferences, inflation, political climate, local and national laws and regulations, foreign currency exchange fluctuations, fuel prices and weather patterns. Our Objective Our objective is to use our formidable assets brands, financial strength, unrivaled distribution system, global reach, and a strong commitment by our management and associates worldwide to achieve long term sustainable growth. Our vision for sustainable growth includes the following: People: Being a great place to work where people are inspired to be the best they can be. Portfolio: Bringing to the world a portfolio of beverage brands that anticipates and satisfies peoples desires and needs. Partners: Nurturing a winning network of partners and building mutual loyalty. Planet: Being a responsible global citizen that makes a difference. Profit: Maximizing return to shareowners while being mindful of our overall responsibilities. Productivity: Managing our people, time and money for greatest effectiveness. 36 Strategic Priorities We have four strategic priorities designed to create long term sustainable growth for our Company and the Coca Cola system and value for our shareowners. These strategic priorities are driving global beverage leadership; accelerating innovation; leveraging our balanced geographic portfolio; and leading the Coca Cola system for growth. To enable the entire Coca Cola system so that we can deliver on these strategic priorities, we must further enhance our core capabilities of consumer marketing; commercial leadership; franchise leadership; and bottling and distribution operations. Core Capabilities Consumer Marketing Marketing investments are designed to enhance consumer awareness of and increase consumer preference for our brands. This produces long term growth in unit case volume, per capita consumption and our share of worldwide nonalcoholic beverage sales. Through our relationships with our bottling partners and those who sell our products in the marketplace, we create and implement integrated marketing programs, both globally and locally, that are designed to heighten consumer awareness of and product appeal for our brands. In developing a strategy for a Company brand, we conduct product and packaging research, establish brand positioning, develop precise consumer communications and solicit consumer feedback. Our integrated marketing activities include, but are not limited to, advertising, point of sale merchandising and sales promotions. We have disciplined marketing strategies that focus on driving volume in emerging markets, increasing our brand value in developing markets and growing profit in our most developed markets. In emerging markets, we are investing in infrastructure programs that drive volume through increased access to consumers. In developing markets, where consumer access has largely been established, our focus is on differentiating our brands. In our most developed markets, we continue to invest in brands and infrastructure programs, but at a slower rate than revenue growth. We are focused on affordability and ensuring we are communicating the appropriate message based on the current economic environment. Commercial Leadership The Coca Cola system has millions of customers around the world who sell or serve our products directly to consumers. We focus on enhancing value for our customers and providing solutions to grow their beverage businesses. Our approach includes understanding each customers business and needs, whether that customer is a sophisticated retailer in a developed market or a kiosk owner in an emerging market. We focus on ensuring that our customers have the right product and package offerings and the right promotional tools to deliver enhanced value to themselves and the Company. We are constantly looking to build new beverage consumption occasions in our customers outlets through unique and innovative consumer experiences, product availability and delivery systems, and beverage merchandising and displays. We participate in joint brand building initiatives with our customers in order to drive customer preference for our brands. Through our commercial leadership initiatives, we embed ourselves further into our retail customers businesses while developing strategies for better execution at the point of sale. Franchise Leadership We must continue to improve our franchise leadership capabilities to give our Company and our bottling partners the ability to grow together through shared values, aligned incentives and a sense of urgency and flexibility that supports consumers always changing needs and tastes. The financial health and success of our bottling partners are critical components of the Companys success. We work with our bottling partners to identify system requirements that enable us to quickly achieve scale and efficiencies, and we share best practices throughout the bottling system. Our system leadership allows us to leverage recent acquisitions to expand our volume base and enhance margins. With our bottling partners, we work to produce differentiated beverages and packages that are appropriate for the right channels and consumers. We also design business models for sparkling and still beverages in specific markets to ensure that we appropriately share the value created by these beverages with our bottling partners. We will continue to build a supply chain network that leverages the size and scale of the Coca Cola system to gain a competitive advantage. 37 Bottling and Distribution Operations While most of our Company beverage products are manufactured, sold and distributed by independently owned and managed bottling partners, the Company has had a significant increase in the number of consolidated bottling and distribution operations over the last several years. We often acquire bottlers in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance. Owning such a controlling interest enables us to compensate for limited local resources; help focus the bottlers sales and marketing programs; assist in the development of the bottlers business and information systems; and establish an appropriate capital structure for the bottler. As a Company we have a long history of providing world class customer service, demonstrating leadership in the marketplace and leveraging the talent of our global workforce. In addition, we have an experienced bottler management team. All of these factors are critical to build upon as we manage our growing bottling and distribution operations. The Company has a deep commitment to continuously improving our business. This includes our efforts to develop innovative packaging and merchandising solutions which help drive demand for our beverages and meet the growing needs of our consumers. As we further transform the way we go to market the Company continues to seek out ways to be more efficient. Challenges and Risks Being a global company provides unique opportunities for our Company. Challenges and risks accompany those opportunities. Our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of the nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry and our Company. Of these, four key challenges and risks are discussed below. Obesity and Inactive Lifestyles. Increasing concern among consumers, public health professionals and government agencies of the potential health problems associated with obesity and inactive lifestyles represents a significant challenge to our industry. We recognize that obesity is a complex public health problem. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line, which includes a wide selection of diet and light beverages, juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and water products. Our commitment also includes adhering to responsible policies in schools and in the marketplace; supporting programs to encourage physical activity and promote nutrition education; and continuously meeting changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. We are committed to playing an appropriate role in helping address this issue in cooperation with governments, educators and consumers through science based solutions and programs. Water Quality and Quantity. Water quality and quantity is an issue that increasingly requires our Companys attention and collaboration with the nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry, governments, nongovernmental organizations and communities where we operate. Water is the main ingredient in substantially all of our products. It is also a limited natural resource facing unprecedented challenges from overexploitation, increasing pollution and poor management. Our Company is in an excellent position to share the water related knowledge we have developed in the communities we serve water resource management, water treatment, wastewater treatment systems, and models for working with communities and partners in addressing water and sanitation needs. We are actively engaged in assessing the specific water related risks that we and many of our bottling partners face and have implemented a formal water risk management program. We are working with our global partners to develop water sustainability projects. We are actively encouraging improved water efficiency and conservation efforts throughout our system. As demand for water continues to increase around the world, we expect commitment and continued action on our part will be crucial in the successful long term stewardship of this critical natural resource. Evolving Consumer Preferences. Consumers want more choices. We are impacted by shifting consumer demographics and needs, on the go lifestyles, aging populations in developed markets and consumers who are empowered with more information than ever. We are committed to generating new avenues for growth through our core brands with a focus on diet and light products. We are also committed to continuing to expand the variety of choices we provide to consumers to meet their needs, desires and lifestyle choices. 38 Increased Competition and Capabilities in the Marketplace. Our Company is facing strong competition from some well established global companies and many local participants. We must continue to selectively expand into other profitable segments of the nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry and strengthen our capabilities in marketing and innovation in order to maintain our brand loyalty and market share. All four of these challenges and risks obesity and inactive lifestyles, water quality and quantity, evolving consumer preferences, and increased competition and capabilities in the marketplace have the potential to have a material adverse effect on the nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry and on our Company; however, we believe our Company is well positioned to appropriately address these challenges and risks. See also "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in Part I of this report for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following: Basis of Presentation Principles of Consolidation Purchase Accounting for Acquisitions Recoverability of Noncurrent Assets Pension Plan Valuations Revenue Recognition Income Taxes Contingencies Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Companys Board of Directors. While our estimates and assumptions are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions. For a discussion of the Companys significant accounting policies, refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Basis of Presentation Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from estimates and assumptions. Furthermore, when testing assets for impairment in future periods, if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur, impairment charges may result. We use the equity method to account for investments in companies if our investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the investee. Our consolidated net income includes our Companys proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies. The carrying values of our equity method investments are increased or decreased by our proportionate share of the net income or loss and other comprehensive income (loss) ("OCI") of these companies. The carrying values of our equity method investments are also decreased by dividends we receive from the investees. Our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy making decisions and material intercompany transactions. 39  We eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions, including the intercompany transactions with consolidated VIEs and the intercompany portion of transactions with equity method investees. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States provide entities the option to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value, with the change in fair value being included in the determination of net income. The Company has currently chosen not to elect the fair value option; and therefore, we only measure assets and liabilities at fair value if required under other accounting guidance. Certain amounts in the prior years consolidated financial statements and notes have been revised to conform to the current year presentation. Principles of Consolidation Our Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest as well as VIEs for which our Company is the primary beneficiary. Generally, we consolidate only business enterprises that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest. However, there are situations in which consolidation is required even though the usual condition of consolidation (ownership of a majority voting interest) does not apply. Generally, this occurs when an entity holds an interest in another business enterprise that was achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship between such entitys voting interests in, and its exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of, the other business enterprise. This disproportionate relationship results in what is known as a variable interest, and the entity in which we have the variable interest is referred to as a VIE. An enterprise must consolidate a VIE if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary has both (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance, and (b) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Our Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling and container manufacturing operations, for which we were not determined to be the primary beneficiary. Our variable interests in these VIEs primarily relate to profit guarantees or subordinated financial support. Refer to Note 11. Although these financial arrangements resulted in us holding variable interests in these entities, the majority of these arrangements did not empower us to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance. Our Companys investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs totaled approximately $1,274 million and $624 million as of December 31, 2010, and 2009, respectively, representing our maximum exposures to loss. The Companys investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs were not significant to the Companys consolidated financial statements. In addition, our Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling and container manufacturing operations, for which we were determined to be the primary beneficiary. Our Companys investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs totaled approximately $191 million and $84 million as of December 31, 2010, and 2009, respectively, representing our maximum exposures to loss. The assets and liabilities of VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary were not significant to the Companys consolidated financial statements. Creditors of our VIEs do not have recourse against the general credit of the Company, regardless of whether they are accounted for as consolidated entities. The information presented above reflects the impact of the Companys adoption of accounting guidance issued by the FASB related to VIEs in June 2009. This accounting guidance resulted in a change in our accounting policy effective January 1, 2010. Among other things, the guidance requires more qualitative than quantitative analyses to determine the primary beneficiary of a VIE, requires continuous assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, enhances disclosures about an enterprises involvement with a VIE, and amends certain guidance for determining whether an entity is a VIE. Beginning January 1, 2010, we deconsolidated certain entities as a result of this change in accounting policy. These entities are primarily bottling operations and had previously been consolidated due to certain loan guarantees and or other financial support given by the Company. These financial arrangements, although not significant to our consolidated financial statements, resulted in a disproportionate relationship between our voting interests in these entities and our exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of the entities. As a result, we determined that we held a majority of the variable interests in these entities and, therefore, were deemed to be the primary beneficiary 40 in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States as of December 31, 2009. Although these financial arrangements resulted in us holding a majority of the variable interests in these VIEs, the majority of these arrangements did not empower us to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance. Consequently, subsequent to the change in accounting policy, the Company deconsolidated the majority of these VIEs. The entities that have been deconsolidated accounted for less than 1 percent of net income attributable to shareowners of The Coca Cola Company in 2009, and we have accounted for these entities under the equity method of accounting since January 1, 2010. Although the deconsolidation of these entities impacted individual line items in our consolidated financial statements, the impact on net income attributable to shareowners of The Coca Cola Company in future periods will be nominal. The equity method of accounting is intended to be a single line consolidation and, therefore, generally should result in the same net income attributable to the investor as would be the case if the investee had been consolidated. The main impact on our consolidated financial statements in 2010 was that, instead of these entities results of operations and balance sheets affecting our consolidated line items, our proportionate share of net income or loss from these entities was reported in equity income (loss) net, in our consolidated income statements, and our investment in these entities was reported as equity method investments in our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to the heading "Structural Changes and New License Agreements" for additional information. Purchase Accounting for Acquisitions The Company adopted new guidance issued by the FASB on January 1, 2009, which changed the application of the acquisition method of accounting in a business combination and also modified the way assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized on a prospective basis. In general, the acquisition method of accounting requires companies to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition. We estimate fair value using the exit price approach which is defined as the price that would be received if we sold an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly market. The value of an exit price is determined from the viewpoint of all market participants as a whole and may result in the Company valuing assets at a fair value that is not reflective of our intended use of the assets. Any amount of the purchase price paid that is in excess of the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded in the line item goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets. Managements judgment is used to determine the estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives for property, plant and equipment and amortization periods for intangible assets, and can materially affect the Companys results of operations. Transaction costs, as well as costs to reorganize acquired companies, are expensed as incurred in the Companys consolidated statements of income. In 2010, we acquired CCEs North American business and recorded total assets of approximately $22.2 billion as of the acquisition date. The assets we acquired included a material amount of intangible assets that are subject to the significant estimates described above. Our acquisition accounting is not complete and adjustments may be recorded in future periods as appraisals for intangible assets and certain fixed assets are completed. Refer to the heading "Recoverability of Noncurrent Assets," below, and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to this acquisition. Recoverability of Noncurrent Assets We perform recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. For certain assets, recoverability and or impairment tests are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For other assets, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently, if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. Our equity method investees also perform such recoverability and or impairment tests. If an impairment charge was recorded by one of our equity method investees, the Company would record its proportionate share of such charge as a reduction of equity income (loss) net in our consolidated income statements. However, the actual amount we record with respect to our proportionate share of such charges may be impacted by items such as basis differences, deferred taxes and deferred gains. 41 Managements assessments of the recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets involve critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management judgment, include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management must estimate include, among others, the economic life of the asset, sales volume, prices, inflation, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates and capital spending. These factors are even more difficult to predict when global financial markets are highly volatile. The estimates we use when assessing the recoverability of noncurrent assets are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. When performing impairment tests, we estimate the fair values of the assets using managements best assumptions, which we believe would be consistent with what a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. Estimates and assumptions used in these tests are evaluated and updated as appropriate. The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. If other assumptions and estimates had been used when these tests were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. As mentioned above, these factors do not change in isolation; and therefore, we do not believe it is practicable to present the impact of changing a single factor. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future periods, future impairment charges could result. Our Company faces many uncertainties and risks related to various economic, political and regulatory environments in the countries in which we operate, particularly in developing or emerging markets. Refer to the heading "Our Business Challenges and Risks," above, and "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in Part I of this report. As a result, management must make numerous assumptions which involve a significant amount of judgment when completing recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent assets in various regions around the world. Investments in Equity and Debt Securities The carrying values of our investments in equity securities are determined using the equity method, the cost method or the fair value method. Refer to the heading "Basis of Presentation," above, for information related to how the carrying values of our equity method investments are determined. We account for investments in companies that we do not control or account for under the equity method either at fair value or under the cost method, as applicable. Investments in equity securities are carried at fair value, if the fair value of the security is readily determinable. Equity investments carried at fair value are classified as either trading or available for sale securities. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities and realized gains and losses on available for sale securities are included in net income. Unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, on available for sale securities are included in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI"). Trading securities are reported as either marketable securities or other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Securities classified as available for sale are reported as either marketable securities or other investments in our consolidated balance sheets, depending on the length of time we intend to hold the investment. Investments in equity securities that do not qualify for fair value accounting are accounted for under the cost method. In accordance with the cost method, our initial investment is recorded at cost and we record dividend income when applicable dividends are declared. Cost method investments are reported as other investments in our consolidated balance sheets. Our investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. Investments in debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held to maturity. Investments in debt securities that are not classified as held to maturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available for sale. The following table presents the carrying values of our investments in equity and debt securities (in millions): December 31, 2010 Carrying Value Percentage of Total Assets Equity method investments $ 6,954 10 % Securities classified as available for sale 485 * Securities classified as trading 209 * Cost method investments 159 * Securities classified as held to maturity 111 * Total $ 7,918 11 % * Accounts for less than 1 percent of the Companys total assets. 42 Investments classified as trading securities are not assessed for impairment, since they are carried at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. We review our investments in equity and debt securities that are accounted for using the equity method or cost method or that are classified as available for sale or held to maturity each reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment. When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to our cost basis in the investment. We also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which our cost basis has exceeded the fair value in the prior period. The fair values of most of our Companys investments in publicly traded companies are often readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded companies, managements assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds and appraisals, as appropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or estimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in developing and emerging markets, may impact the determination of fair value. In the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. If management determines the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Managements assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is based on, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis, the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, and our intent and ability to retain the investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. As of December 31, 2010, unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities were approximately $267 million and $5 million, respectively. Management assessed each individual investment with unrealized losses to determine if the decline in fair value was other than temporary. Based on these assessments, management determined that the decline in fair value of each of these investments was temporary in nature. We will continue to monitor these investments in future periods. Refer to Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2010, the Company recognized other than temporary impairments of $41 million related to certain available for sale securities and an equity method investment. These impairment charges were recorded in other income (loss) net and impacted the Bottling Investments and Corporate operating segments. Refer to Note 16 and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2009, the Company recorded a charge of approximately $27 million in other income (loss) net as a result of an other than temporary decline in the fair value of a cost method investment. As of December 31, 2008, the estimated fair value of this investment approximated the Companys carrying value in the investment. However, in 2009, the Company was informed by the investee of its intent to reorganize its capital structure in 2009, which resulted in the Companys shares in the investee being canceled. As a result, the Company determined that the decline in fair value of this cost method investment was other than temporary. This impairment charge impacted the Corporate operating segment. Refer to Note 16 and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had several investments classified as available for sale securities in which our cost basis exceeded the fair value of the investment, each of which initially occurred between the end of the second quarter and the beginning of the third quarter of 2008. Management determined that the decline in fair value of each investment was other than temporary, and the Company recognized impairment charges of approximately $81 million during the fourth quarter of 2008. These impairment charges were recorded to other income (loss) net in the consolidated statement of income. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 43 The following table presents the difference between calculated fair values, based on quoted closing prices of publicly traded shares, and our Companys cost basis in publicly traded bottlers accounted for as equity method investments (in millions): December 31, 2010 Fair Value Carrying Value Difference Coca Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. $ 4,740 $ 1,315 $ 3,425 Coca Cola Amatil Limited 2,322 948 1,374 Coca Cola Hellenic Bottling Company S.A. 2,204 1,336 868 Coca Cola Icecek A.S. 692 183 509 Coca Cola Embonor S.A. 480 284 196 Grupo Continental, S.A.B. 439 175 264 Embotelladoras Coca Cola Polar S.A. 160 96 64 Coca Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated 138 83 55 $ 11,175 $ 4,420 $ 6,755 Other Assets Our Company invests in infrastructure programs with our bottlers that are directed at strengthening our bottling system and increasing unit case volume. Additionally, our Company advances payments to certain customers to fund future marketing activities intended to generate profitable volume and expenses such payments over the periods benefited. Advance payments are also made to certain customers for distribution rights. Payments under these programs are generally capitalized and reported in the line items prepaid expenses and other assets or other assets, as appropriate, in our consolidated balance sheets. When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. In 2010, as a result of our acquisition of CCEs North American business, the Company recorded a charge of $265 million related to preexisting relationships. The charge was primarily related to the write off of our investment in infrastructure programs with CCE. Our investment in these infrastructure programs with CCE did not meet the criteria to be recognized as an asset subsequent to the acquisition. Refer to Note 2 and Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Property, Plant and Equipment As of December 31, 2010, the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment, net of depreciation, was approximately $14,727 million, or 20 percent of our total assets. Certain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment should be assessed, including, among others, a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in the business climate in a particular market, or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses or projected future losses. When such events or changes in circumstances are present, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset (or asset group) and its eventual disposition. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of property, plant and equipment, including appraisals and discounted cash flow models, which are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use. 44  Goodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets Intangible assets are classified into one of three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill. For intangible assets with definite lives, tests for impairment must be performed if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill, tests for impairment must be performed at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. The following table presents the carrying values of intangible assets included in our consolidated balance sheet (in millions): December 31, 2010 Carrying Value Percentage of Total Assets Goodwill $ 11,665 16 % Bottlers franchise rights with indefinite lives 7,511 10 Trademarks with indefinite lives 6,356 9 Definite lived intangible assets, net 1,264 2 Other intangible assets not subject to amortization 113 * Total $ 26,909 37 % * Accounts for less than 1 percent of the Companys total assets. When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of definite lived intangible assets may not be recoverable, management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of these assets, including discounted cash flow models, which are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use. We test intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, including trademarks, franchise rights and goodwill, for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. Our Company performs these annual impairment reviews as of the first day of our third fiscal quarter. We use a variety of methodologies in conducting impairment assessments of indefinite lived intangible assets, including, but not limited to, discounted cash flow models, which are based on the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use. For indefinite lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segments. Our operating segments are primarily based on geographic responsibility, which is consistent with the way management runs our business. Our operating segments are subdivided into smaller geographic regions or territories that we sometimes refer to as business units. These business units are also our reporting units. The Bottling Investments operating segment includes all Company owned or consolidated bottling operations, regardless of geographic location, except for bottling operations managed by CCR, which are included in our North America operating segment. Generally, each Company owned or consolidated bottling operation within our Bottling Investments operating segment is its own reporting unit. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination. In 2010, the Company combined several reporting units within our Europe operating segment. In addition, we also combined several reporting units within our Pacific operating segment. These changes were the result of the Companys productivity initiatives. The goodwill impairment test consists of a two step process, if necessary. The first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. We typically use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. The assumptions used in these models are consistent with those we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the second step of the impairment test must be performed in order to determine the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the 45 carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. Intangible assets acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, primarily due to the fact that they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and macroeconomic conditions present at the time of acquisition. Consequently, if operating results and or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate shortly after an acquisition, it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets. A deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models, but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the estimated cost of capital and or discount rates. Additionally, as discussed above, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. As a result, the cost of capital and or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends, regardless of whether our Companys actual cost of capital has changed. Therefore, if the cost of capital and or discount rates change, our Company may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset or assets in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to, or greater than, our previously forecasted amounts. As of our most recent annual impairment review, the Company had no significant impairments of its intangible assets, individually or in the aggregate. In addition, as of December 31, 2010, we did not have any reporting units with a material amount of goodwill for which it is reasonably likely that they will fail step one of a goodwill impairment test in the near term. However, if macroeconomic conditions worsen, it is possible that we may experience significant impairments of some of our intangible assets, which would require us to recognize impairment charges. Management will continue to monitor the fair value of our intangible assets in future periods. In 2010, we acquired CCEs North American business, which resulted in the Company recording $13,878 million of intangible assets, including goodwill. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The acquired intangible assets included $5,705 million of bottler franchise rights, which consisted of $5,100 million of franchise rights with indefinite lives and $605 million of franchise rights with definite lives. The franchise rights with indefinite lives represent franchise rights that had previously provided CCE with exclusive and perpetual rights to manufacture and or distribute certain beverages in specified territories. The franchise rights with definite lives relate to franchise rights that had previously provided CCE with exclusive rights to manufacture and or distribute certain beverages in specified territories for a finite period of time and, therefore, have been classified as definite lived intangible assets. The bottler franchise rights acquired by the Company in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business include the contractual rights previously impaired by CCE. In 2008, CCE recorded pretax impairment charges of approximately $7.6 billion ($4.9 billion after tax), which reduced the carrying value of CCEs North American franchise rights to zero. The decline in the estimated fair value of CCEs North American franchise rights was the result of several factors including, but not limited to, (1) challenging macroeconomic conditions which contributed to lower than anticipated volume for higher margin packages and certain higher margin beverage categories; (2) increases in raw material costs including significant increases in aluminum, HFCS and resin; (3) increased delivery costs as a result of higher fuel costs; (4) a dramatic increase in market debt rates, which impacted the capital charge; and (5) a significant decline in the funded status of CCEs defined benefit pension plans. Similar factors may also potentially result in future impairments. In 2008, the Companys proportionate share of these impairment charges recorded by CCE was approximately $1.6 billion, which we recorded to equity income (loss) net. Refer to the heading "Operations Review Equity Income (Loss) Net" and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company recorded $7,746 million of goodwill in connection with this acquisition, which is not tax deductible and has been assigned to the North America operating segment. This goodwill is primarily related to synergistic value created from having a unified operating system that will strategically position us to better market and distribute our nonalcoholic beverage brands in North America. It also includes certain other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, such as an assembled workforce. In 2009, the Company recognized a $23 million impairment charge due to a change in the expected useful life of an intangible asset, which was previously determined to have an indefinite life. Refer to the heading "Operations Review Other Operating Charges," and Note 16 and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 46 Hyperinflationary Economies Our Company conducts business in more than 200 countries, some of which have been deemed to be hyperinflationary economies due to excessively high inflation rates in recent years. These economies create financial exposure to the Company. Venezuela was deemed to be a hyperinflationary economy subsequent to December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2009, two main exchange rate mechanisms existed in Venezuela. The first exchange rate mechanism is known as the official rate of exchange ("official rate"), which is set by the Venezuelan government. In order to utilize the official rate, entities must seek approval from the government operated Foreign Exchange Administration Board ("CADIVI"). As of December 31, 2009, the official rate set by the Venezuelan government was 2.15 bolivars per U.S. dollar. The second exchange rate mechanism was known as the parallel rate, which in some circumstances provided entities with a more liquid exchange through the use of a series of transactions via a broker. Subsequent to December 31, 2009, Venezuela was determined to be a hyperinflationary economy, and the Venezuelan government devalued the bolivar by resetting the official rate to 2.6 bolivars per U.S. dollar for essential goods and 4.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar for nonessential goods. In accordance with hyperinflationary accounting under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, our local subsidiary was required to use the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. As a result, we remeasured the net assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary using the official rate for nonessential goods of 4.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar. During the first quarter of 2010, we recorded a loss of approximately $103 million related to the remeasurement of our Venezuelan subsidiarys net assets. The loss was recorded in the line item other income (loss) net in our consolidated statement of income. We classified the impact of the remeasurement loss in the line item effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated statement of cash flows. In early June 2010, the Venezuelan government introduced a newly regulated foreign currency exchange system known as the Transaction System for Foreign Currency Denominated Securities ("SITME"). This new system, which is subject to annual limits, replaced the parallel market whereby entities domiciled in Venezuela are able to exchange their bolivar to U.S. dollars through authorized financial institutions (commercial banks, savings and lending institutions, etc.). In December 2010, the Venezuelan government announced that it was eliminating the official rate of 2.6 bolivars per U.S. dollar for essential goods. As a result, there are only two exchange rates available for remeasuring bolivar denominated transactions as of December 31, 2010, the official rate of 4.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar for nonessential goods and the SITME rate. As discussed above, the Company has remeasured the net assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary using the official rate for nonessential goods of 4.3 bolivars per U.S. dollar since January 1, 2010. Therefore, the elimination of the official rate for essential goods had no impact on the remeasurement of the net assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary. We continue to use the official exchange rate for nonessential goods to remeasure the financial statements of our Venezuelan subsidiary. If the official exchange rate devalues further, it would result in our Company recognizing additional foreign currency exchange losses in our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2010, our Venezuelan subsidiary held monetary assets of approximately $200 million. In addition to the foreign currency exchange exposure related to our Venezuelan subsidiarys net assets, we also sell concentrate to our bottling partner in Venezuela from outside the country. These sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Some of our concentrate sales were approved by the CADIVI to receive the official rate for essential goods of 2.6 bolivars per U.S. dollar prior to the elimination of the official rate for essential goods in December 2010. Prior to the elimination of the official rate for essential goods, our bottling partner in Venezuela was able to convert bolivars to U.S. dollars to settle our receivables related to sales approved by the CADIVI. Therefore, as of December 31, 2010, our receivable balance related to concentrate sales that had been approved by the CADIVI was not significant. If we are unable to utilize a government approved exchange rate mechanism for future concentrate sales to our bottling partner in Venezuela, the amount of receivables related to these sales will increase. In addition, we have certain intangible assets associated with products sold in Venezuela. If we are unable to utilize a government approved exchange rate mechanism for concentrate sales, or if the bolivar further devalues, it could result in the impairment of these intangible assets. As of December 31, 2010, the carrying value of our accounts receivable from our bottling partner in Venezuela and intangible assets associated with products sold in Venezuela was approximately $135 million. The revenues and cash flows associated with concentrate sales to our bottling partner in Venezuela in 2011 are not anticipated to be significant to the Companys consolidated financial statements. 47 Pension Plan Valuations Our Company sponsors and or contributes to pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans covering substantially all U.S. employees. We also sponsor nonqualified, unfunded defined benefit pension plans for certain associates and participate in multi employer pension plans in the United States. In addition, our Company and its subsidiaries have various pension plans and other forms of postretirement arrangements outside the United States. Management is required to make certain critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions used to determine our pension expense and related obligation. We believe the most critical assumptions are related to (1) the discount rate used to determine the present value of the liabilities and (2) the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. All of our actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually. Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension expense and related obligation. At each measurement date, we determine the discount rate by reference to rates of high quality, long term corporate bonds that mature in a pattern similar to the future payments we anticipate making under the plans. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the weighted average discount rate used to compute our benefit obligation was 5.5 percent and 5.75 percent, respectively. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based upon the long term outlook of our investment strategy as well as our historical returns and volatilities for each asset class. We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of our long term rates. Our pension plan investment objective is to ensure all our plans have sufficient funds to meet their benefit obligations when they become due. As a result, the Company periodically revises asset allocations, where appropriate, to improve returns and manage risk. The weighted average expected long term rate of return used to calculate our net periodic benefit cost was 8.0 percent in both 2010 and 2009. In 2010, the Companys total pension expense was $176 million. In 2011, we expect our total pension expense to be approximately $240 million. The expected increase is primarily due to the impact of our acquisition of CCEs North American business. The estimated impact of an additional 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate on our 2011 pension expense is an increase to our pension expense of approximately $21 million. Additionally, the estimated impact of a 50 basis point decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets on our 2011 pension expense is an increase to our pension expense of approximately $20 million. The sensitivity information provided above is based only on changes to the actuarial assumptions used for our U.S. pension plans. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our pension plans and related actuarial assumptions. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of products has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. For our Company, this generally means that we recognize revenue when title to our products is transferred to our bottling partners, resellers or other customers. Title usually transfers upon shipment to or receipt at our customers locations, as determined by the specific sales terms of each transaction. Our sales terms do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing defects on our part. Our customers can earn certain incentives, which are included in deductions from revenue, a component of net operating revenues in the consolidated statements of income. These incentives include, but are not limited to, cash discounts, funds for promotional and marketing activities, volume based incentive programs and support for infrastructure programs. Refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The aggregate deductions from revenue recorded by the Company in relation to these programs, including amortization expense on infrastructure programs, were approximately $5.0 billion, $4.5 billion and $4.4 billion in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In preparing the financial statements, management must make estimates related to the contractual terms, customer performance and sales volume to determine the total amounts recorded as deductions from revenue. Management also considers past results in making such estimates. The actual amounts ultimately paid may be different from our estimates. Such differences are recorded once they have been determined, and have historically not been significant. 48  Income Taxes Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain based upon one of the following: (1) the tax position is not "more likely than not" to be sustained, (2) the tax position is "more likely than not" to be sustained, but for a lesser amount, or (3) the tax position is "more likely than not" to be sustained, but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken. For purposes of evaluating whether or not a tax position is uncertain, (1) we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information, (2) the technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position, and (3) each tax position is evaluated without considerations of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax positions taken. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the "more likely than not" recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is "more likely than not" to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. Tax law requires items to be included in the tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements. As a result, the annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our tax return (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. The tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year and manner in which the differences are expected to reverse. Based on the evaluation of all available information, the Company recognizes future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not. We evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results, the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, taxable income in prior carryback years (if permitted) and the availability of tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is required to be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that the Company will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset. As of December 31, 2010, the Companys valuation allowances on deferred tax assets were $950 million and are primarily related to uncertainties regarding the future realization of recorded tax benefits on tax loss carryforwards generated in various jurisdictions. Current evidence does not suggest we will realize sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (e.g., capital gain versus ordinary income) within the carryforward period to allow us to realize these deferred tax benefits. If we were to identify and implement tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or generate sufficient income of the appropriate character in these jurisdictions in the future, it could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense. The Company believes that it will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets. The Company does not record a U.S. deferred tax liability for the excess of the book basis over the tax basis of its investments in foreign corporations to the extent that the basis difference results from earnings that meet the indefinite reversal criteria. This criteria is met if the foreign subsidiary has invested, or will invest, the undistributed earnings indefinitely. The decision as to the amount of undistributed earnings that the Company intends to maintain in non U.S. subsidiaries takes into account items including, but is not limited to, forecasts and budgets of financial needs of cash for working capital, liquidity plans, capital improvement programs, merger and acquisition plans, and planned loans to other non U.S. subsidiaries. The Company also evaluates its expected cash requirements in the United States. Other 49 factors that can influence that determination are local restrictions on remittances (for example, in some countries a central bank application and approval are required in order for the Companys local country subsidiary to pay a dividend), economic stability, and asset risk. As of December 31, 2010, undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries that met the indefinite reversal criteria amounted to $20.8 billion. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Companys effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23.5 percent to 24.5 percent in 2011. This estimated tax rate does not reflect the impact of any unusual or special items that may affect our tax rate in 2011. Contingencies Our Company is subject to various claims and contingencies, mostly related to legal proceedings and tax matters (both income taxes and indirect taxes). Due to their nature, such legal proceedings and tax matters involve inherent uncertainties including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties and governmental actions. Management assesses the probability of loss for such contingencies and accrues a liability and or discloses the relevant circumstances, as appropriate. Management believes that any liability to the Company that may arise as a result of currently pending legal proceedings, tax matters or other contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company taken as a whole. Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Standards and Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting standards and pronouncements. Operations Review Our organizational structure as of December 31, 2010, consisted of the following operating segments, the first six of which are sometimes referred to as "operating groups" or "groups": Eurasia and Africa; Europe; Latin America; North America; Pacific; Bottling Investments; and Corporate. For further information regarding our operating segments, refer to Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements In order to continually improve upon the Companys operating performance, from time to time, we engage in buying and selling ownership interests in bottling partners and other manufacturing operations. In addition, we also acquire brands or enter into license agreements for certain brands to supplement our beverage offerings. These items impact our operating results and certain key metrics used by management in assessing the Companys performance. Unit case volume growth is a key metric used by management to evaluate the Companys performance because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. The Companys unit case volume represents the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers and, therefore, reflects unit case volume for consolidated and unconsolidated bottlers. Refer to the heading "Beverage Volume," below. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates and syrups (in all cases expressed in equivalent unit cases) sold by, or used in finished products sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. Refer to the heading "Beverage Volume," below. Our Bottling Investments segment and our other finished products operations, including those managed by CCR, typically generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling beverages and a variety of still beverages, such as juices and juice drinks, energy and sports drinks, ready to drink teas and coffees, and certain water products, to retailers or to distributors, wholesalers and bottling partners who distribute them to retailers. In addition, in the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers such as restaurants and convenience stores who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. For these finished products operations, we recognize the associated concentrate sales volume at the time the unit case or unit case equivalent is sold to the customer. Our concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to authorized bottling and canning operations. For these concentrate operations, we recognize concentrate revenue and concentrate 50 sales volume when we sell concentrate to the authorized unconsolidated bottling and canning operations and we typically report unit case volume when finished products manufactured from the concentrates and syrups are sold to the customer. When we analyze our net operating revenues we generally consider the following four factors: (1) volume growth (unit case volume or concentrate sales volume, as appropriate), (2) structural changes, (3) changes in price, product and geographic mix and (4) foreign currency fluctuations. Refer to the heading "Net Operating Revenues," below. "Structural changes" generally refers to acquisitions or dispositions of bottling, distribution or canning operations and consolidation or deconsolidation of bottling and distribution entities for accounting purposes. Typically, structural changes do not impact the Companys unit case volume on a consolidated basis or at the geographic operating segment level. We recognize unit case volume for all sales of Company beverage products regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any. However, our Bottling Investments operating segment is generally impacted by structural changes because it only includes the unit case volume of consolidated bottlers. The Company sells concentrates and syrups to both consolidated and unconsolidated bottling partners. The ownership structure of our bottling partners impacts the timing of recognizing concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our consolidated bottling partners, we are not able to recognize the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume until the bottling partner has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a customer. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our unconsolidated bottling partners, we recognize the concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume when the concentrates or syrups are sold to the bottling partner. The subsequent sale of the finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a customer does not impact the timing of recognizing the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume. "Acquired brands" refers to brands acquired during the current year. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to acquired brands in periods prior to the closing of the transaction. Therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume from the sale of these brands is incremental to prior year volume. We do not generally consider acquired brands to be structural changes. "License agreements" refers to brands not owned by the Company, but for which we hold certain rights, generally including, but not limited to, distribution rights, and we derive an economic benefit from the ultimate sale of these brands. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to these brands in periods prior to the beginning of the term of the license agreement. Therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume from the sale of these brands is incremental to prior year volume. We do not generally consider new license agreements to be structural changes. The following significant transactions and agreements impacted the Companys 2010 operating results: on October 2, 2010, in legally separate transactions, we acquired CCEs North American business and entered into a license agreement with DPS; on October 2, 2010, we sold all of our ownership interests in our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE; and on January 1, 2010, we deconsolidated certain entities, primarily bottling operations, as a result of the Companys adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. The impact that each of the aforementioned items had on the Companys consolidated financial statements is discussed throughout this report, as appropriate. The sections below are intended to provide an overview of the impact these items had on our 2010 operating results and are expected to have on key metrics used by management. Acquisition of CCEs North American Business and the DPS License Agreements Immediately prior to the October 2, 2010 completion of our acquisition of CCEs North American business, the Company owned 33 percent of CCEs outstanding common stock. This ownership represented our indirect ownership interest in both CCEs North American business and its European operations. On October 2, 2010, the Company acquired the remaining 67 percent of CCEs North American business not already owned by the Company for consideration that included the Companys indirect ownership interest in CCEs European operations. As a result of this transaction, the Company now owns 100 percent of CCEs North American business and does not own any interest in New CCEs European operations. Refer to the heading "Our Business General," above, and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the acquisition. 51  The operating results of CCEs North American business are included in our consolidated financial statements effective October 2, 2010. The operating results of New CCE had no direct impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements, since we have no ownership interest in this entity. CCEs North American business contributed net revenues of approximately $3,637 million and net losses of approximately $122 million from October 2, 2010 through December 31, 2010. Furthermore, the Company recorded total assets as a result of the acquisition of $22.2 billion. Refer to the heading "Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position," below, for additional information related to the impact the acquisition had on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. On October 2, 2010, the Company also entered into an agreement with DPS to distribute certain DPS brands in territories where these brands were distributed by CCE prior to our acquisition of CCEs North American business. The license agreements replaced agreements between DPS and CCE existing immediately prior to the completion of our acquisition of CCEs North American business. Refer to the heading "Our Business General," above, and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to these new license agreements. Prior to the acquisition of CCEs North American business and entering into the DPS license agreements, the Companys North America operating segment was predominantly a concentrate operation. As a result of the acquisition of CCEs North American business and the DPS license agreements, the North America operating segment is now predominantly a finished products operation. Generally, finished products operations produce higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins and operating margins compared to concentrate operations. Refer to "Item 1. Business Products and Brands," for additional discussion of the differences between the Companys concentrate operations and our finished products operations. These transactions resulted in higher net operating revenues, but lower gross profit margins and operating margins for the North America operating segment and our consolidated operating results. Prior to the acquisition of CCEs North American business, the Company reported unit case volume for the sale of Company beverage products sold by CCE. After the transaction closing, we reported unit case volume of Company beverage products just as we had prior to the transaction. Prior to the acquisition of CCEs North American business, the Company recognized concentrate sales volume at the time we sold the concentrate to CCE. Upon the closing of the transaction, we do not recognize the concentrate sales volume until CCR has sold finished products manufactured from concentrate to a customer. The DPS license agreements impact both the Companys unit case and concentrate sales volume. Sales made pursuant to these license agreements represent acquired volume and are incremental unit case volume and concentrate sales volume to the Company. Prior to entering into the license agreements, the Company did not include the DPS brands as unit case volume or concentrate sales volume, as these brands were not Company beverage products. As mentioned above, we do not normally consider new license agreements to be structural changes. However, in the case of the DPS license agreements, given their correlation to our acquisition of CCEs North American business, we have included the impact of these license agreements as a structural change when explaining our 2010 financial results. Since we have determined it is appropriate to include the impact of the DPS license agreements as a structural change, the total revenues attributable to CCEs North American business, including DPS, recognized by the Company since the date of acquisition are considered a structural change. Prior to the acquisition, we recognized the revenues and profits associated with concentrate sales when the concentrate was sold to CCE, excluding the portion that was deemed to be intercompany due to our previous ownership interest in CCE. However, subsequent to the acquisition, the Company will not recognize the revenues and profits associated with concentrate sold to CCEs North American business until the finished products manufactured from those concentrates are sold. For example, in 2010, most of our pre Easter concentrate sales to CCE impacted our first quarter operating results. In 2011, we anticipate that most of our Easter related finished product sales will likely impact our second quarter operating results. Likewise, in 2010, most of our pre July 4th concentrate sales to CCE impacted our second quarter operating results. In 2011, the impact of the July 4th holiday related finished product sales will likely impact our third quarter operating results. As a result of this transaction, the Company does not have an indirect ownership interest in New CCEs European operations. Therefore, we are no longer required to defer the portion of revenues and profits associated with concentrate sales to New CCE. 52 In 2010, the gross profit for our North America operating segment was negatively impacted by $235 million, primarily due to the elimination of gross profit in inventory on intercompany sales and an inventory fair value adjustment as a result of the acquisition. Refer to the headings "Gross Profit Margin" and "Operating Income and Operating Margin." The acquisition of CCEs North American business has resulted in a significant adjustment to our overall cost structure, especially in North America. We estimate that approximately 35 percent of our total cost of goods in 2011 will be comprised of both the raw material and conversion costs associated with the following inputs: (1) sweeteners, (2) metals, (3) juices and (4) PET. The bulk of these costs will reside within our North America and Bottling Investments operating segments. We anticipate the underlying commodities related to these inputs will continue to face upward pressure; and therefore, we have increased our hedging activities related to certain commodities in order to mitigate a portion of the price risk associated with forecasted purchases. Many of the derivative financial instruments used by the Company to mitigate the risk associated with these commodity exposures do not qualify for hedge accounting. As a result, the change in fair value of these derivative instruments will be included as a component of net income each reporting period. Refer to the heading "Gross Profit Margin," below, and Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our commodity hedging activity. The acquisition of CCEs North American business increased the Companys selling, general and administrative expenses in 2010, primarily due to delivery related expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses are typically higher, as a percentage of net operating revenues, for finished products operations compared to concentrate operations. Selling, general and administrative expenses were also negatively impacted by the amortization of definite lived intangible assets acquired in the acquisition. The Company recorded $605 million of definite lived acquired franchise rights that are being amortized over a weighted average life of approximately 8 years, which is equal to the weighted average remaining contractual term of the acquired franchise rights. In addition, the Company recorded $380 million of customer rights that are being amortized over 20 years. We estimate the amortization expense related to these definite lived intangible assets to be approximately $100 million per year for the next several years, which will be recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Once fully integrated, we expect to generate operational synergies of at least $350 million per year. We anticipate realizing approximately $140 million to $150 million of these synergies in 2011. Refer to the heading "Other Operating Charges," below, and Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding this integration initiative. In connection with the Companys acquisition of CCEs North American business, we assumed $7,602 million of long term debt, which had an estimated fair value of $9,345 million as of the acquisition date. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we recorded the assumed debt at its fair value as of the acquisition date. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. On November 15, 2010, the Company issued $4,500 million of long term notes and used some of the proceeds to repurchase $2,910 million of long term debt. The Company used the remaining cash from the issuance to reduce our outstanding commercial paper balance. The repurchased debt consisted of $1,827 million of debt assumed in our acquisition of CCEs North American business and $1,083 million of the Companys debt that was outstanding prior to the acquisition. The Company recorded a charge of $342 million related to the premiums paid to repurchase the long term debt and the costs associated with the settlement of treasury rate locks issued in connection with the debt tender offer. Refer to the heading "Interest Expense," below, and Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In 2010, we recognized a gain of $4,978 million due to the remeasurement of our equity interest in CCE to fair value upon the close of the transaction. This gain was classified in the line item other income (loss) net in our consolidated statement of income. Although our 2010 operating results and certain key metrics were affected by these structural changes, we do not believe it is indicative of the impact they will have on future operating periods. Our 2011 consolidated financial statements will reflect twelve months of operating results of the acquired CCE North American business and DPS license agreements compared to three months in 2010. Therefore, we expect these structural changes to have a significant impact on our operating results and certain key metrics in 2011, when compared to 2010. Prior to the closing of this acquisition, we had accounted for our investment in CCE under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, we recorded our proportionate share of CCEs net income or loss 53 in the line item equity income (loss) net in our consolidated statements of income. However, as a result of this transaction, beginning October 2, 2010, the Company no longer records equity income or loss related to CCE; and therefore, we expect this transaction to negatively impact equity income in future periods. Refer to the heading "Equity Income (Loss) Net," below. Divestiture of Norwegian and Swedish Bottling Operations The divestiture of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations had no impact on our consolidated unit case volume and consolidated concentrate sales volume, for the same reasons discussed above in relation to our acquisition of CCEs North American business. The divestiture of these bottling operations reduced unit case volume for the Bottling Investments operating segment. In addition, the divestiture reduced net operating revenues and net income for our consolidated operating results and the Bottling Investments operating segment. However, since we divested a finished goods business, it had a positive impact on our gross profit margins and operating margins. Furthermore, the impact these divestitures had on the Companys net operating revenues was partially offset by the concentrate revenues that were recognized on sales to these bottling operations. These concentrate sales had previously been eliminated because they were intercompany transactions. The net impact to net operating revenues was included as a structural change in our analysis of changes to net operating revenues. Refer to the heading "Net Operating Revenues," below. This divestiture resulted in a gain of $597 million, which was classified in the line item other income (loss) net in our consolidated statement of income. Impact of New Accounting Guidance Beginning January 1, 2010, we deconsolidated certain entities as a result of the Companys adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. These entities are primarily bottling operations and have been accounted for under the equity method of accounting since they were deconsolidated. Refer to the heading "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Principles of Consolidation," above. The entities that have been deconsolidated as a result of this change in accounting guidance accounted for approximately 3 percent of the Companys consolidated net operating revenues and less than 1 percent of net income attributable to shareowners of The Coca Cola Company in 2009. Refer to the heading "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Principles of Consolidation," above. These entities accounted for approximately 4 percent of the Companys equity income in 2010. Refer to the heading "Equity Income (Loss) Net," below. The impact that the deconsolidation of these entities had on net operating revenues was included as a structural change. Refer to the heading "Net Operating Revenues," below. Beverage Volume We measure the volume of Company beverage products sold in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and (2) concentrate sales. As used in this report, "unit case" means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight ounce servings); and "unit case volume" means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers. Unit case volume primarily consists of beverage products bearing Company trademarks. Also included in unit case volume are certain products licensed to, or distributed by, our Company, and brands owned by Coca Cola system bottlers for which our Company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive economic benefit. In addition, unit case volume includes sales by joint ventures in which the Company has an equity interest. We believe unit case volume is one of the measures of the underlying strength of the Coca Cola system because it measures trends at the consumer level. The unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the Company from its bottling partners and distributors. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates and syrups (in all cases expressed in equivalent unit cases) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. Unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period. Factors such as seasonality, bottlers inventory practices, supply point changes, timing of price increases, new product introductions and changes in product mix can impact unit case volume and concentrate sales volume and can create differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. In addition to the items mentioned above, the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures, in which the Company has an equity interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates or syrups, may give rise to differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. 54 Information about our volume growth by operating segment is as follows: Percent Change 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Year Ended December 31, Unit Cases 1,2 Concentrate Sales Unit Cases 1,2 Concentrate Sales Worldwide 5 % 5 % 3 % 3 % Eurasia & Africa 12 % 12 % 4 % 5 % Europe (1 ) (2 ) Latin America 5 7 6 7 North America 2 2 (2 ) (2 ) Pacific 6 6 7 7 Bottling Investments (1 ) N/A 2 N/A 1 Bottling Investments operating segment data reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only. 2 Geographic segment data reflects unit case volume growth for all bottlers in the applicable geographic areas, both consolidated and unconsolidated. Unit Case Volume The Coca Cola system sold approximately 25.5 billion unit cases of our products in 2010, approximately 24.4 billion unit cases in 2009 and approximately 23.7 billion unit cases in 2008. Year Ended December 31, 2010, versus Year Ended December 31, 2009 In Eurasia and Africa, unit case volume increased 12 percent, which consisted of 10 percent growth in sparkling beverages and 21 percent growth in still beverages. The groups unit case volume growth was primarily attributable to 17 percent growth in India, which included growth of 15 percent and 23 percent in sparkling and still beverages, respectively. Indias growth in sparkling beverages was led by double digit growth in Trademarks Sprite, Thums Up and Coca Cola, which reflected the benefit of successful national marketing programs. Still beverage growth in India included the impact of 22 percent growth in our Maaza juice brand. In addition to growth in India, the groups unit case volume growth included 14 percent growth in Turkey, 8 percent growth in North and West Africa, 16 percent growth in Russia, 20 percent growth in Southern Eurasia, 12 percent growth in East and Central Africa and 5 percent growth in South Africa. The growth across the African continent was attributable to the strong performance of both sparkling and still beverages and the benefit of our FIFA World Cup activation programs. Unit case volume in Europe was even, which reflected the impact of continuing difficult macroeconomic conditions throughout certain regions in Europe. The groups unit case volume included unit case volume growth of 5 percent in France, 1 percent in Germany and 2 percent in our Nordic Business Unit. The growth in these regions was offset by unit case volume declines in other regions, including a 7 percent decline in South and Eastern Europe, primarily due to continuing macroeconomic pressures. The groups unit case volume also included unit case volume declines of 2 percent and 1 percent in Italy and Iberia, respectively. In Latin America, unit case volume increased 5 percent, which consisted of 4 percent growth in sparkling beverages and 9 percent growth in still beverages. The groups unit case volume growth was led by 11 percent growth in Brazil and 3 percent growth in Mexico. Brazils unit case volume growth was primarily due to 11 percent growth in sparkling beverages, led by 11 percent growth in Trademark Coca Cola. Mexicos unit case volume growth was impacted by adverse weather conditions. The groups unit case volume growth also included 5 percent growth in our South Latin Business Unit. All of the aforementioned markets benefited from our strong FIFA World Cup activation programs. Unit case volume in North America increased 2 percent, including 1 percent attributable to the new license agreements with DPS. The groups unit case volume growth was driven by 5 percent growth in still beverages, led by 19 percent growth in Trademark Powerade, 12 percent growth in teas and 23 percent growth in Trademark Simply. Unit case volume for sparkling beverages in North America increased 1 percent, primarily due to the sale of DPS brands under the new license agreements. Coca Cola Zero continued its strong performance in North America with 15 percent 55 growth in 2010. The groups strong marketing initiatives, including our FIFA World Cup activation programs, contributed to the unit case volume growth in North America. The volume and net operating revenues attributable to the sale of DPS brands have been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues. Refer to the heading "Net Operating Revenues," below, and "Structural Changes and New License Agreements," above. In Pacific, unit case volume increased 6 percent, which consisted of 13 percent growth in still beverages and 2 percent growth in sparkling beverages. The groups volume growth was led by 6 percent growth in China, 15 percent growth in the Philippines and 3 percent growth in Japan. Chinas volume growth included 21 percent growth in juices and juice drinks primarily due to the continued strong momentum of Minute Maid Pulpy, as well as strong growth in other still beverages including water. Tough weather conditions, including flooding in the higher per capita consumption regions, negatively impacted unit case volume in China. In the Philippines, unit case volume growth was led by 14 percent growth in Trademark Coca Cola. In Japan, the unit case volume growth was driven by successful in market activations, strong innovation and favorable weather conditions. Included in Japans unit case volume growth was 5 percent growth in Trademark Coca Cola, primarily due to strong FIFA World Cup activation programs and our Coca Cola Summer Promotion. Japans unit case volume growth also benefited from 17 percent growth in sports drinks. Unit case volume for Bottling Investments decreased 1 percent, primarily due to the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of the Companys adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. These entities are primarily bottling operations and have been accounted for under the equity method of accounting since they were deconsolidated on January 1, 2010. Refer to the heading "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Principles of Consolidation" and "Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements." The deconsolidation of these entities negatively impacted the unit case volume for Bottling Investments by approximately 9 percent. Unit case volume for Bottling Investments was also negatively impacted by the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE. The unfavorable impact of the aforementioned items was partially offset by growth in markets where we own or otherwise consolidate the bottling operations. Unit case volume grew 6 percent in China, 17 percent in India, 15 percent in the Philippines and 1 percent in Germany. The Companys consolidated bottling operations account for approximately 33 percent, 66 percent, 100 percent and 100 percent of the unit case volume in China, India, the Philippines and Germany, respectively. Year Ended December 31, 2009, versus Year Ended December 31, 2008 In Eurasia and Africa, unit case volume increased 4 percent, which consisted of 3 percent growth in sparkling beverages and 8 percent growth in still beverages. The groups unit case volume growth was primarily attributable to 31 percent growth in India, led by 32 percent growth in sparkling beverages. The sparkling beverages growth in India was largely due to double digit growth in Trademarks Thums Up, Sprite, Fanta and Coca Cola. Still beverages in India grew 28 percent, driven by double digit growth in Trademark Maaza. The group also benefited from 6 percent volume growth in North and West Africa and 10 percent volume growth in East and Central Africa. The groups unit case volume growth also included the impact of a 14 percent volume decline in Russia, primarily due to a challenging economic environment. In addition, South Africa and Turkey each experienced a 1 percent unit case volume decline. Unit case volume in Europe decreased 1 percent, primarily attributable to difficult macroeconomic conditions throughout most of Europe. These difficult macroeconomic conditions impacted a number of key markets and contributed to unit case volume declines of 8 percent in South and Eastern Europe, 4 percent in Iberia and 2 percent in Germany. The volume declines in these markets were partially offset by 6 percent unit case volume growth in France and 4 percent growth in Great Britain. The unit case volume growth in both France and Great Britain was led by Trademark Coca Cola. In Latin America, unit case volume increased 6 percent, which consisted of 3 percent growth in sparkling beverages and 24 percent growth in still beverages. The group benefited from strong volume growth in key markets, including 6 percent in Mexico, 4 percent in Brazil, 2 percent in Argentina and double digit growth in Colombia. Acquisitions contributed 1 percentage point of the groups total unit case volume growth. The groups sparkling beverage volume growth was primarily attributable to 4 percent growth in brand Coca Cola. The successful integration of Jugos del Valle, S.A.B. de C.V. ("Jugos del Valle") drove still beverage volume growth. 56 Unit case volume in North America decreased 2 percent, which reflected the impact of a difficult U.S. economic environment and a competitive pricing environment. The effect of the economic environment and pricing environment was partially offset by the impact of strong customer and consumer programs. North Americas unit case volume decline consisted of a 3 percent decline in sparkling beverages, partially offset by 1 percent growth in still beverages. The decline in sparkling beverages was partly attributable to the significant price increase taken by bottlers in the fourth quarter of 2008. The decline was partially offset by the continued strong performance of Coca Cola Zero, which had unit case volume growth of 19 percent. Still beverage unit case volume growth was primarily due to the strong performance of Fuze Beverage, LLC ("Fuze"), Trademark Simply and tea. The unit case volume growth in still beverages was reduced by a double digit volume decline in the North American water businesses, including Trademark Dasani, primarily due to the slowing water category and the Companys decision to not pursue unprofitable volume opportunities in bulk water/case packs in North America. In Pacific, unit case volume increased 7 percent, which consisted of growth in sparkling and still beverages of 6 percent and 8 percent, respectively. Sparkling beverage growth in Pacific included 14 percent growth in Trademark Sprite and 5 percent growth in Trademark Coca Cola. The groups volume growth was led by 16 percent growth in China, which reflected 11 percent growth in sparkling beverages and 30 percent growth in still beverages. Chinas sparkling beverage volume growth was led by double digit growth in Trademark Sprite and 6 percent growth in Trademark Coca Cola. Chinas still beverage volume growth was led by double digit growth in Minute Maid. The unit case volume growth in China was partially offset by a 2 percent volume decline in Japan, primarily due to the continued severe economic challenges and unfavorable weather conditions during what are traditionally high volume months. Sparkling beverage volume in Japan was even, while still beverages declined 3 percent. The decline in still beverages included the impact of a 5 percent volume decline in Aquarius and a 3 percent decline in Georgia Coffee. Due to the weak economy, Georgia Coffee was negatively impacted by shifts away from the at work vending channel. The groups volume increase also included a 1 percent increase in the Philippines. Unit case volume for Bottling Investments increased 2 percent, primarily due to the impact of unit case volume growth of 16 percent in China, 31 percent in India and 1 percent in the Philippines. The Companys consolidated bottling operations account for approximately 33 percent, 65 percent and 100 percent of the unit case volume in China, India and the Philippines, respectively. The favorable impact of unit case volume in these markets was partially offset by the sale of certain bottling operations during 2008, including Refrigerantes Minas Gerais Ltda. ("Remil"), a bottler in Brazil, and the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in Coca Cola Beverages Pakistan Ltd. ("Coca Cola Pakistan"), which resulted in its deconsolidation. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, Germanys unit case volume declined 2 percent. The Companys consolidated bottling operations account for 100 percent of the unit case volume in Germany. Concentrate Sales Volume In 2010, concentrate sales volume and unit case volume both grew 5 percent compared to 2009. In 2009, concentrate sales volume and unit case volume both grew 3 percent compared to 2008. The differences between concentrate sales volume and unit case volume growth rates for individual operating segments in 2010 and 2009 were primarily due to the timing of concentrate shipments and the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the Company has an equity interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates, syrups, beverage bases or powders. 57 Analysis of Consolidated Statements of Income Percent Change Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 (In millions except percentages and per share data) NET OPERATING REVENUES $ 35,119 $ 30,990 $ 31,944 13 % (3 )% Cost of goods sold 12,693 11,088 11,374 14 (3 ) GROSS PROFIT 22,426 19,902 20,570 13 (3 ) GROSS PROFIT MARGIN 63.9 % 64.2 % 64.4 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 13,158 11,358 11,774 16 (4 ) Other operating charges 819 313 350 * * OPERATING INCOME 8,449 8,231 8,446 3 (3 ) OPERATING MARGIN 24.1 % 26.6 % 26.4 % Interest income 317 249 333 27 (25 ) Interest expense 733 355 438 106 (19 ) Equity income (loss) net 1,025 781 (874 ) 31 * Other income (loss) net 5,185 40 39 * * INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 14,243 8,946 7,506 59 19 Income taxes 2,384 2,040 1,632 17 25 Effective tax rate 16.7 % 22.8 % 21.7 % CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME 11,859 6,906 5,874 72 18 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 50 82 67 (39 ) 22 NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO SHAREOWNERS OF THE COCA COLA COMPANY $ 11,809 $ 6,824 $ 5,807 73 % 18 % NET INCOME PER SHARE1 Basic net income per share $ 5.12 $ 2.95 $ 2.51 74 % 18 % Diluted net income per share $ 5.06 $ 2.93 $ 2.49 73 % 18 % * Calculation is not meaningful. 1 Basic net income per share and diluted net income per share are calculated based on net income attributable to shareowners of The Coca Cola Company. 58 Net Operating Revenues Year Ended December 31, 2010, versus Year Ended December 31, 2009 Net operating revenues increased by $4,129 million, or 13 percent.

Refer to the heading "Beverage Volume," above, for additional information related to changes in our unit case and concentrate sales volume. Refer to the heading "Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements," above, for additional information related to significant structural changes. Price, product and geographic mix had a favorable 1 percent impact on consolidated net operating revenues. Price, product and geographic mix for our operating segments was impacted by a variety of factors and events including, but not limited to, the following: consolidated results were unfavorably impacted by geographic mix as a result of growth in our emerging and developing markets. The growth in our emerging and developing markets resulted in unfavorable geographic mix due to the fact that the revenue per unit sold in these markets is generally less than in developed markets; Eurasia and Africa was negatively impacted by unfavorable geographic mix due to the growth in emerging and developing markets such as India and Russia. The revenue per unit sold in these markets is generally less than in developed markets; Latin America was favorably impacted by pricing in a number of our key markets and the impact of still beverages growing faster than sparkling beverages; Pacific was negatively impacted by unfavorable geographic mix due to the growth in emerging and developing markets such as China and the Philippines. The revenue per unit sold in these markets is generally less than in developed markets. 59  The favorable impact of currency fluctuations increased net operating revenues by approximately 2 percent. The favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was primarily due to a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Brazilian real, South African rand and Australian dollar, which had a favorable impact on the Eurasia and Africa, Latin America, Pacific and Bottling Investments operating segments. The favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to the aforementioned currencies was partially offset by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the euro and British pound, which had an unfavorable impact on the Europe and Bottling Investments operating segments. Refer to the heading "Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position Foreign Exchange." Year Ended December 31, 2009, versus Year Ended December 31, 2008 Net operating revenues decreased by $954 million, or 3 percent.

Our Bottling Investments operating segment data reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only. Refer to the heading "Beverage Volume," above. Refer to the heading "Beverage Volume," above, for additional information related to changes in our unit case and concentrate sales volume. Structural changes accounted for approximately 1 percent of the decrease in net operating revenues. This decrease was primarily attributable to the sale of certain bottling operations during 2008, including Remil and a portion of our ownership interest in Coca Cola Pakistan, which resulted in its deconsolidation. Refer to the heading "Operations Review Other Income (Loss) Net" and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Price, product and geographic mix had a net zero percent impact on consolidated net operating revenues. Price, product and geographic mix for our operating segments was impacted by a variety of factors and events including, but not limited to, the following: consolidated results were unfavorably impacted by shifts in our marketing and media spend strategies. The shift in our marketing and media spend strategies was primarily due to spending more marketing dollars toward in store activations, loyalty points programs and point of sale marketing. Many of these strategies impact net revenues instead of marketing expenses. Refer to the heading "Selling, General and Administrative Expenses," below; consolidated results were unfavorably impacted by geographic mix as a result of growth in our emerging and developing markets. The growth in our emerging and developing markets resulted in unfavorable geographic mix due to the fact that the revenue per unit sold in these markets is generally less than in developed markets; Latin America benefited from the successful integration of Jugos del Valle. Refer to the heading "Beverage Volume," above; 60 North America was favorably impacted by the growth of our still beverage volume, primarily due to the strong performance of Fuze, Trademark Simply and tea. Refer to the heading "Beverage Volume," above; Pacific was negatively impacted by unfavorable geographic mix due to the growth in emerging and developing markets such as China and a decline in Japan, a developed market. Refer to the heading "Beverage Volume," above. The revenue per unit sold in emerging and developing markets is generally less than in developed markets. The Pacific operating segment was also unfavorably impacted by shifts away from the at work vending channel in our Japanese business. The unfavorable impact of currency fluctuations decreased net operating revenues by approximately 5 percent. The unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to most foreign currencies, including the euro, South African rand, British pound, Brazilian real, Mexican peso and Australian dollar, which had an unfavorable impact on the Eurasia and Africa, Europe, Latin America, Pacific and Bottling Investments operating segments. The unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the aforementioned currencies was partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen, which had a favorable impact on the Pacific operating segment. Refer to the heading "Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position Foreign Exchange." Net Operating Revenues by Operating Segment Information about our net operating revenues by operating segment as a percentage of Company net operating revenues is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Eurasia & Africa 6.9 % 6.4 % 6.7 % Europe 12.6 13.9 15.0 Latin America 11.0 12.0 11.3 North America 31.7 26.4 25.7 Pacific 14.1 14.6 13.7 Bottling Investments 23.4 26.4 27.3 Corporate 0.3 0.3 0.3 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % The percentage contribution of each operating segment has changed due to net operating revenues in certain operating segments growing at a faster rate compared to the other operating segments. Net operating revenue growth rates are impacted by sales volume, structural changes, price and product/geographic mix, and foreign currency fluctuations. In 2010, the percentage of the Companys net operating revenues contributed by our North America operating segment increased by 5.3 percent, primarily due to our acquisition of CCEs North American business and sales related to our new license agreements with DPS. In 2011, we expect the percentage contribution by our North America operating segment to increase from 2010 due to the full year impact of these structural items. During the fourth quarter of 2010, the first quarter of operation following our acquisition of CCEs North American business and the new license agreements with DPS, our North America operating segment contributed 45.8 percent of the Companys net operating revenues. Although the fourth quarter of 2010 may not be indicative of the full year 2011 percentage contribution, it provides trend information related to the potential future impact of these structural changes. In addition, in 2010, the percentage of the Companys net operating revenues contributed by our Bottling Investments operating segment decreased by 3.0 percent, primarily due to the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of the Companys adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB and the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE. Refer to the heading "Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements," above. The size and timing of structural changes are not consistent from period to period. As a result, anticipating the impact of such events on future net operating revenues, and other financial statement line items, usually is not possible. We expect structural changes to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements in future periods. 61 Gross Profit Margin Year Ended December 31, 2010, versus Year Ended December 31, 2009 Our gross profit margin decreased to 63.9 percent from 64.2 percent. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of our acquisition of CCEs North American business, partially offset by favorable geographic mix, product mix, the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations and the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of the Companys adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. Refer to the heading "Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements," above, for additional information regarding the impact of our acquisition of CCEs North American business, the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations and the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of the Companys adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. The favorable geographic mix was primarily due to many of our emerging markets recovering from the global recession at a quicker pace than our developed markets. Although this shift in geographic mix has a negative impact on net operating revenues, it generally has a favorable impact on our gross profit margin due to the correlated impact it has on our product mix. The product mix in the majority of our emerging and developing markets is more heavily skewed toward our sparkling beverage products, which generally yield a higher gross profit margin compared to our still beverages and finished products. Refer to the heading "Net Operating Revenues," above. In 2011, we expect our gross profit margin to decline due to the full year impact of consolidating CCEs North American business, as well as an increase in commodity costs. The acquisition of CCEs North American business has resulted in a significant adjustment to our overall cost structure, especially in North America. Finished products operations typically have lower gross profit margins and the additional commodity risk could lead to higher raw material costs in 2011. Subsequent to this transaction, approximately 35 percent of our consolidated cost of goods sold is comprised of the raw material and conversion cost associated with the following inputs: (1) sweeteners, (2) metals, (3) juices and (4) PET. The majority of these costs are incurred by our North America and Bottling Investments operating segments. We anticipate that the cost of underlying commodities related to these inputs will continue to face upward pressure. We expect the full year 2011 impact of increased commodity costs on our total company results to range between $300 million and $400 million. Upon the close of our acquisition of CCEs North American business, we increased our hedging activities related to certain commodities in order to mitigate a portion of the price risk associated with forecasted purchases. Many of the derivative financial instruments used by the Company to mitigate the risk associated with these commodity exposures do not qualify for hedge accounting. As a result, the change in fair value of these derivative instruments will be included as a component of net income each reporting period. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Year Ended December 31, 2009, versus Year Ended December 31, 2008 Our gross profit margin decreased to 64.2 percent in 2009 from 64.4 percent in 2008, primarily due to foreign currency fluctuations, the growth of our finished products operations, unfavorable geographic mix as a result of growth in our emerging and developing markets, our current focus to drive greater affordability initiatives across many key markets, and unfavorable channel and product mix in certain key markets. The unfavorable impact of the previously mentioned items was partially offset by the favorable impact of price increases in certain markets, lower costs related to several key commodities and the sale of certain bottling operations in 2008. Generally, bottling and finished products operations produce higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins compared to concentrate and syrup operations. Bottling operations sold in 2008 included Remil and a portion of our ownership interest in Coca Cola Pakistan, which resulted in its deconsolidation. Refer to the heading "Other Income (Loss) Net," below, and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 62  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses The following table sets forth the significant components of selling, general and administrative expenses (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Stock based compensation expense $ 380 $ 241 $ 266 Advertising expenses 2,917 2,791 2,998 Bottling and distribution expenses 3,902 2,627 2,815 Other operating expenses 5,959 5,699 5,695 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 13,158 $ 11,358 $ 11,774 Year Ended December 31, 2010, versus Year Ended December 31, 2009 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $1,800 million, or 16 percent. Foreign currency fluctuations increased selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately 1 percent. The increase in stock based compensation was primarily related to higher payouts tied to performance in conjunction with our long term incentive compensation programs and the impact of modifications made to certain replacement performance share unit awards issued by the Company in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business. The Company modified primarily all of these replacement performance share unit awards to eliminate the remaining holding period, which resulted in approximately $74 million of accelerated expense in the fourth quarter of 2010. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in advertising expenses reflected the Companys continued investment in our brands and building market execution capabilities. The increase in bottling and distribution expenses was primarily related to the impact of our acquisition of CCEs North American business and our continued investments in our other bottling operations. The unfavorable impact of these items was partially offset by the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of the Companys adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. These entities are primarily bottling operations and accounted for approximately 2 percent of the Companys consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses in 2009. Bottling and distribution expenses were also reduced due to the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE. Refer to the heading "Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements," above, for additional information related to significant structural changes. In 2011, our pension expense is expected to increase by approximately $60 million compared to 2010. The anticipated increase is primarily due to the impact of our acquisition of CCEs North American business and a decrease in our discount rate compared to 2010. The expected unfavorable impact of these items will be partially offset by the expected favorable impact of approximately $800 million of anticipated contributions to various plans in 2011, of which approximately $750 million was contributed in the first quarter of 2011. Approximately half of the anticipated 2011 contributions will be allocated to our primary U.S. pension plans. Refer to the heading "Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position" for information related to these contributions. Refer to the heading "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Pension Plan Valuations," and Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the discount rates used by the Company. As of December 31, 2010, we had $457 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share based compensation arrangements granted under our plans. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.7 years as stock based compensation expense. This expected cost does not include the impact of any future stock based compensation awards. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Year Ended December 31, 2009, versus Year Ended December 31, 2008 Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $416 million, or 4 percent. The decrease was primarily attributable to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, which decreased selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately 4 percent. Advertising expenses were impacted by shifts in our marketing and media spend strategies, primarily due to spending more marketing dollars toward in store activations, loyalty points programs and point of sale marketing. Many of these strategies impact net operating revenues instead of marketing expenses. Refer to the heading "Net Operating Revenues," above. The decrease in bottling and distribution expenses was primarily attributable to the full year impact of certain bottling operations sold in 2008. Bottling operations sold in 2008 included Remil and a 63 portion of our ownership interest in Coca Cola Pakistan, which resulted in its deconsolidation. Other operating expenses reflects the impact of an increase in pension costs and higher short term incentive costs, partially offset by savings generated from the Companys ongoing productivity initiatives. The increase in our pension expense was primarily attributable to the significant decline in the value of our pension plan assets precipitated by the credit crisis and financial system instability in 2008. As a result of this decline, along with a decrease in the discount rate, our 2009 pension costs increased by $103 million. Other Operating Charges Other operating charges incurred by operating segment were as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Eurasia & Africa $ 7 $ 4 $ 1 Europe 50 7 Latin America 1 North America 133 31 56 Pacific 22 1 Bottling Investments 122 141 46 Corporate 485 129 246 Total $ 819 $ 313 $ 350 In 2010, the Company incurred other operating charges of approximately $819 million, which consisted of $478 million associated with the Companys productivity, integration and restructuring initiatives, $250 million related to charitable contributions, $81 million due to transaction costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business and the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE and $10 million of charges related to bottling activities in Eurasia. The Companys integration activities include costs associated with the integration of CCEs North American business, as well as the integration of 18 German bottling and distribution operations acquired in 2007. The charitable contributions were primarily attributable to a cash donation to The Coca Cola Foundation. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the transaction costs. In 2010, the Company began an integration initiative related to our acquisition of CCEs North American business, which resulted in total expenses of $135 million. These expenses were primarily related to both internal and external costs associated with the development and design of our future operating framework. These charges impacted the North America and Corporate operating segments. Our acquisition of CCEs North American business closed on October 2, 2010. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe this acquisition will result in an evolved franchise system that will enable us to better serve the unique needs of the North American market. The creation of a unified operating system will strategically position us to better market and distribute our nonalcoholic beverage brands in North America. We are reconfiguring our manufacturing, supply chain and logistics operations to achieve cost reductions over time. Once fully integrated, we expect to generate operational synergies of at least $350 million per year. We anticipate that these operational synergies will be phased in over the next four years, and that we will begin to fully realize the annual benefit from these synergies in the fourth year. We currently expect to realize approximately $140 million to $150 million of these synergies in 2011. Upon completion of the CCE transaction, we combined the management of the acquired North American business with the management of our existing foodservice business, Minute Maid and Odwalla juice businesses, North America supply chain operations and Company owned bottling operations in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, into a unified bottling and customer service organization called CCR. In addition, we reshaped our remaining CCNA operations into an organization that primarily provides franchise leadership and consumer marketing and innovation for the North American market. As a result of the transaction and related reorganization, our North American businesses operate as aligned and agile organizations with distinct capabilities, responsibilities and strengths. The Company currently expects the total cost of these integration initiatives to be approximately $425 million and anticipates recognizing these charges over the next three years. 64 The Companys integration initiatives include costs related to the integration of 18 German bottling and distribution operations acquired in 2007. The Company began these integration initiatives in 2008 and has incurred total pretax expenses of approximately $225 million since they commenced. The expenses recorded in connection with these integration activities have been primarily due to involuntary terminations. The Company is currently reviewing other integration and restructuring opportunities within the German bottling and distribution operations, which if implemented will result in additional charges in future periods. However, as of December 31, 2010, the Company had not finalized any additional plans. Refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to this integration initiative. The Company has recognized costs of approximately $352 million related to our ongoing productivity initiatives since they commenced in the first quarter of 2008. The Company is targeting $500 million in annualized savings from productivity initiatives by the end of 2011 to provide additional flexibility to invest for growth. The savings are expected to be generated in a number of areas and include aggressively managing operating expenses supported by lean techniques, redesigning key processes to drive standardization and effectiveness, better leveraging our size and scale, and driving savings in indirect costs through the implementation of a "procure to pay" program. In realizing these savings, the Company expects to incur total costs of approximately $500 million by the end of 2011. The Company believes we are on track to achieve our $500 million target in annualized savings by the end of 2011. Refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the Companys ongoing productivity initiatives. In 2009, the Company incurred other operating charges of $313 million, which consisted of $273 million related to the Companys productivity, integration and restructuring initiatives and $40 million due to asset impairments. Refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our productivity, integration and restructuring initiatives. The impairment charges were related to a $23 million impairment of an intangible asset and a $17 million impairment of a building. The impairment of the intangible asset was due to a change in the expected useful life of the asset, which was previously determined to have an indefinite life. The $17 million impairment was due to a change in disposal strategy related to a building that is no longer occupied. The Company had originally intended to sell the building along with the related land. However, we have determined that the maximum potential sales proceeds would likely be realized through the sale of vacant land. As a result, the building was removed. The land is not considered held for sale, primarily due to the fact that it is not probable a sale would be completed within one year. In 2008, the Company incurred other operating charges of $350 million, which consisted of $249 million due to productivity and restructuring initiatives, $63 million related to contract termination fees and $38 million due to asset impairments. Refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our productivity and restructuring initiatives. The contract termination fees were primarily the result of penalties incurred by the Company to terminate existing supply and co packer agreements. The asset impairment charges were primarily due to the write down of manufacturing lines that produced product packaging materials. 65 Operating Income and Operating Margin Information about our operating income contribution by operating segment on a percentage basis is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Eurasia & Africa 11.6 % 9.8 % 9.9 % Europe 35.2 35.8 37.6 Latin America 28.5 24.8 24.8 North America 18.0 20.7 18.8 Pacific 24.2 22.9 22.0 Bottling Investments 2.7 2.2 3.1 Corporate (20.2 ) (16.2 ) (16.2 ) Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Information about our operating margin on a consolidated basis and by operating segment is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Consolidated 24.1 % 26.6 % 26.4 % Eurasia & Africa 40.4 % 41.0 % 39.1 % Europe 67.3 68.4 66.4 Latin America 62.0 55.2 57.9 North America 13.6 20.7 19.3 Pacific 41.4 41.6 42.6 Bottling Investments 2.8 2.2 3.0 Corporate * * * * Calculation is not meaningful. As demonstrated by the tables above, the percentage contribution to operating income and operating margin by operating segment fluctuated from year to year. Operating income and operating margin by operating segment were influenced by a variety of factors and events including the following: In 2010, foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted consolidated operating income by approximately 3 percent. The favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was primarily due to a weaker U.S. dollar compared to most foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Brazilian real, South African rand and Australian dollar, which had a favorable impact on the Eurasia and Africa, Latin America, Pacific and Bottling Investments operating segments. The favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to the aforementioned currencies was partially offset by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the euro and British pound, which had an unfavorable impact on the Europe and Bottling Investments operating segments. Refer to the heading "Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position Foreign Exchange." In 2010, operating income was favorably impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by approximately 7 percent for Eurasia and Africa, 3 percent for Latin America, 8 percent for Pacific and 9 percent for Bottling Investments. Operating income was unfavorably impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by approximately 1 percent for Europe. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates had a nominal impact on operating income for North America and Corporate. In 2010, our consolidated operating margin was favorably impacted by geographic mix. The favorable geographic mix was primarily due to many of our emerging markets recovering from the global recession at a quicker pace than our developed markets. Although this shift in geographic mix has a negative impact on net operating revenues, it generally has a favorable impact on our gross profit margin and operating margin due to the correlated impact it has on our product mix. The product mix in the majority of our emerging and developing markets is more heavily skewed toward products in our sparkling beverage portfolio, which generally yield a higher gross profit margin compared to our still beverages and finished products. 66 In 2010, our consolidated operating margin was favorably impacted by the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of the Companys adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. These entities are primarily bottling operations and have been accounted for under the equity method of accounting since they were deconsolidated on January 1, 2010. Generally, bottling and finished products operations produce higher net revenues but lower operating margins compared to concentrate and syrup operations. The majority of the deconsolidated entities had previously been included in our Bottling Investments operating segment. In 2010, the operating margin for the Latin America operating segment was favorably impacted by the sale of 50 percent of our ownership interest in Le&atilde;o Junior resulting in its deconsolidation, as well as the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of the Companys adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. Price and product mix also favorably impacted Latin Americas operating income and operating margin during the year. In 2010, the operating margin for the North America operating segment was unfavorably impacted by the Companys acquisition of CCEs North American business. Generally, bottling and finished products operations have higher net operating revenues but lower operating margins when compared to concentrate and syrup operations. Refer to the heading "Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements," above. In 2010, operating income for the North America operating segment was reduced by $74 million due to the acceleration of expense associated with certain share based replacement awards issued in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2010, operating income for the North America operating segment was negatively impacted by $235 million, primarily due to the elimination of gross profit in inventory on intercompany sales and an inventory fair value adjustment as a result of our acquisition of CCEs North American business. Prior to the acquisition, we recognized the profit associated with concentrate sales when the concentrate was sold to CCE, excluding the portion that was deemed to be intercompany due to our previous ownership interest in CCE. However, subsequent to the acquisition, the Company will not recognize the profit associated with concentrate sold to CCEs legacy North American business until the finished beverage products made from those concentrates are sold. In 2010, operating income for the North America operating segment was reduced by $20 million due to the amortization of favorable supply contracts acquired in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business. In 2010, operating income was reduced by $7 million for Eurasia and Africa, $50 million for Europe, $133 million for North America, $22 million for Pacific, $122 million for Bottling Investments and $485 million for Corporate, primarily due to the Companys productivity, integration and restructuring initiatives, charitable donations, transaction costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business and the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE and other charges related to bottling activities in Eurasia. Refer to the heading "Other Operating Charges," above. In 2009, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted consolidated operating income by approximately 11 percent. The unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to most foreign currencies, including the euro, South African rand, British pound, Brazilian real, Mexican peso and Australian dollar, which had an unfavorable impact on the Eurasia and Africa, Europe, Latin America, Pacific and Bottling Investments operating segments. The unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the aforementioned currencies was partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen, which had a favorable impact on the Pacific operating segment. Refer to the heading "Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position Foreign Exchange." In 2009, operating income was unfavorably impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by approximately 15 percent for Eurasia and Africa, 11 percent for Europe, 18 percent for Latin America, 1 percent for North America, 19 percent for Bottling Investments and 4 percent for Corporate. Operating income was favorably impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by approximately 3 percent for Pacific. 67 In 2009, shifts in our marketing and media spend strategies favorably impacted the operating margin in the majority of our operating segments. The shift was primarily due to spending more marketing dollars toward in store activations, improving shelf impact, loyalty points programs and point of sale marketing. Many of these strategies are recorded as deductions from revenues instead of marketing expenses. Refer to the heading "Net Operating Revenues," above. In 2009, lower commodity prices favorably impacted North Americas operating margin. In 2009, the operating margins for the Latin America and North America operating segments were unfavorably impacted by the growth of our finished goods businesses. Generally, bottling and finished products operations produce higher net revenues but lower operating margins compared to concentrate and syrup operations. In 2009, our consolidated operating margin was favorably impacted by the sale of certain bottling operations during 2008, including Remil and a portion of our ownership interest in Coca Cola Pakistan, which resulted in its deconsolidation. Generally, bottling and finished products operations produce higher net revenues but lower operating margins compared to concentrate and syrup operations. In 2009, operating income was reduced by approximately $4 million for Eurasia and Africa, $7 million for Europe, $31 million for North America, $1 million for Pacific, $141 million for Bottling Investments and $129 million for Corporate, primarily as a result of restructuring costs, the Companys ongoing productivity initiatives and asset impairments. Refer to the heading "Other Operating Charges," above. In 2008, operating income was reduced by approximately $1 million for Eurasia and Africa, $1 million for Latin America, $56 million for North America, $46 million for Bottling Investments and $246 million for Corporate, primarily due to restructuring costs, contract termination fees, productivity initiatives and asset impairments. Refer to the heading "Other Operating Charges," above. Interest Income Year Ended December 31, 2010, versus Year Ended December 31, 2009 Interest income increased by $68 million, or 27 percent. The increase was primarily due to the impact of higher average cash and short term investment balances, partially offset by lower average interest rates. Year Ended December 31, 2009, versus Year Ended December 31, 2008 Interest income decreased by $84 million, or 25 percent. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest rates, partially offset by the impact of higher short term investment balances. Interest Expense Year Ended December 31, 2010, versus Year Ended December 31, 2009 Interest expense increased $378 million, primarily due to a $342 million charge related to the premiums paid to repurchase long term debt and the costs associated with the settlement of treasury rate locks issued in connection with the debt tender offer. The increase also reflects the impact of interest expense on debt assumed from CCE. In connection with the Companys acquisition of CCEs North American business, we assumed $266 million of short term borrowings and $7,602 million of long term debt. The estimated fair value of the long term debt was approximately $9,345 million as of the acquisition date. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we recorded the assumed debt at its fair value as of the acquisition date. On November 15, 2010, the Company issued $4,500 million of long term notes and used some of the proceeds to repurchase $2,910 million of long term debt. The remaining cash from the issuance was used to reduce our outstanding commercial paper balance. As of December 31, 2010, the carrying value of the Companys long term debt included approximately $994 million of fair value adjustments related to the debt assumed from CCE. These fair value adjustments will be amortized over a weighted average period of approximately 15 years, which is equal to the weighted average maturity of the assumed debt to which these fair value adjustments relate. The amortization of these fair value adjustments will be a reduction of interest expense in future periods, which will typically result in our interest expense being less than the actual interest paid to service the debt. Total interest paid was $422 million in 2010. 68  Year Ended December 31, 2009, versus Year Ended December 31, 2008 Interest expense decreased by $83 million, or 19 percent. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates on short term debt, partially offset by the issuance of long term debt in the first quarter of 2009. The Company elected to replace a certain amount of commercial paper and short term debt with longer term debt, which resulted in the Company issuing long term notes in the principal amounts of $900 million at a rate of 3.625 percent and $1,350 million at a rate of 4.875 percent due March 15, 2014, and March 15, 2019, respectively. The interest rates on the long term notes are higher than the interest rates on our short term debt. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, interest expense in 2008 included the impact of the reclassification of approximately $17 million of previously unrecognized gains on interest rate locks from AOCI to interest expense, which was partially offset by approximately $9 million of losses related to the portion of cash flow hedges that were deemed to be ineffective. The reclassification was the result of a discontinued cash flow hedging relationship on interest rate locks, as it was no longer probable that we would issue the long term debt for which these hedges were designated. Equity Income (Loss) Net Year Ended December 31, 2010, versus Year Ended December 31, 2009 Equity income (loss) net represents our Companys proportionate share of net income or loss from each of our equity method investments. In 2010, equity income was $1,025 million, compared to equity income of $781 million in 2009, an increase of $244 million, or 31 percent. The increase was primarily due to our proportionate share of increased net income from certain of our equity method investees; the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations; a decrease in the Companys proportionate share of asset impairments and restructuring charges recorded by equity method investees; and the impact of the Companys adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. The impact of these items was partially offset by the impact of our acquisition of CCEs North American business, which resulted in the consolidation of CCEs North American business. As a result of this transaction, the Company stopped recording equity income related to CCE beginning October 2, 2010. Refer to the heading "Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements," above. The Companys adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB resulted in the deconsolidation of certain entities. These entities are primarily bottling operations and have been accounted for under the equity method of accounting since they were deconsolidated on January 1, 2010. Refer to the heading "Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements," above. The entities that have been deconsolidated accounted for approximately 4 percent of the Companys equity income in 2010. Year Ended December 31, 2009, versus Year Ended December 31, 2008 In 2009, equity income was $781 million, compared to an equity loss of $874 million in 2008, an increase of $1,655 million. In 2008, equity income (loss) net was impacted by our proportionate share of approximately $7.6 billion of pretax charges ($4.9 billion after tax) recorded by CCE due to impairments of its North American franchise rights. The Companys proportionate share of these charges was approximately $1.6 billion. Refer to the heading "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Goodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets," and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in equity income in 2009 was also partially attributable to our proportionate share of increased net income from certain of our equity method investees, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange fluctuations and the Companys proportionate share of asset impairments and restructuring charges recorded by equity method investees. Other Income (Loss) Net Other income (loss) net includes, among other things, the impact of foreign exchange gains and losses, dividend income, rental income, gains and losses related to the disposal of property, plant and equipment, realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities, realized gains and losses on available for sale securities, other than temporary impairments of available for sale securities and the accretion of expense related to certain acquisitions. The foreign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies. The effects of the remeasurement of these assets 69 and liabilities are partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2010, other income (loss) net was income of $5,185 million, primarily related to a $4,978 million gain related to the remeasurement of our equity investment in CCE to fair value upon the close of our acquisition of CCEs North American business and a $597 million gain related to the sale of all of our ownership interests in our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE. Refer to the heading "Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements," above, and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These gains were partially offset by a $265 million charge related to preexisting relationships with CCE and foreign currency exchange losses of $148 million. The charge related to preexisting relationships was primarily due to the write off of our investment in infrastructure programs with CCE. The foreign currency exchange losses were primarily due to a charge of approximately $103 million related to the remeasurement of our Venezuelan subsidiarys net assets. Refer to the heading "Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position Foreign Exchange." In addition to the items mentioned above, other income (loss) net also included a $23 million gain on the sale of 50 percent of our investment in Le&atilde;o Junior and $48 million of charges related to other than temporary impairments and a donation of preferred shares in one of our equity investees. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2009, other income (loss) net was income of $40 million, primarily related to a realized gain of approximately $44 million on the sale of equity securities classified as available for sale, $40 million from the sale of other investments and $18 million of dividend income from cost method investments. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the gain on the sale of available for sale securities. These gains were partially offset by approximately $34 million in net foreign currency exchange losses and an other than temporary impairment charge of approximately $27 million on a cost method investment. Refer to the heading "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Investments in Equity and Debt Securities," and Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2008, other income (loss) net was income of $39 million. The Company recognized gains on divestitures of approximately $119 million, primarily related to the sale of Remil to Coca Cola FEMSA and the sale of a portion of the Companys investment in Coca Cola Pakistan to Coca Cola Icecek A.S. ("Coca Cola Icecek"). Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other income (loss) net also included approximately $24 million in net foreign currency exchange gains in 2008. The gains on divestitures and net foreign currency exchange were partially offset by other than temporary impairment charges of approximately $81 million on available for sale securities. Refer to the heading "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Investments in Equity and Debt Securities," and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other income (loss) net also included approximately $46 million of realized and unrealized losses on trading securities. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate reflects tax benefits derived from significant operations outside the United States, which are generally taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent. A change in the mix of pretax income from these various tax jurisdictions can have a significant impact on the Companys periodic effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate of approximately 16.7 percent for the year ended December 31, 2010, included the following: an approximate 27 percent combined effective tax rate on the Companys productivity, integration and restructuring initiatives, charitable donations, transaction costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business and the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE and other charges related to bottling activities in Eurasia (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); a tax benefit of $34 million related to the remeasurement of our equity investment in CCE to fair value upon our acquisition of CCEs North American business. The tax benefit reflects the impact of reversing deferred tax liabilities associated with our equity investment in CCE prior to the acquisition (refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); an approximate 37 percent effective tax rate on charges related to preexisting relationships with CCE (refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); 70 an approximate 44 percent effective tax rate on the gain related to the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE (refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); an approximate 35 percent combined effective tax rate on the elimination of gross profit in inventory on intercompany sales and an inventory fair value adjustment as a result of our acquisition of CCEs North American business (refer to the heading "Gross Profit Margin," above); an approximate 37 percent combined effective tax rate on the amortization of favorable supply contracts acquired in connection with our acquisition and mark to market gains related to non designated hedges that are associated with underlying transactions expected to occur in a future period; an approximate 38 percent effective tax rate on the acceleration of expense associated with certain share based replacement awards issued in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business (refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); an approximate 4 percent combined effective tax rate on other than temporary impairments and a donation of preferred shares in one of our equity method investees (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); an approximate 33 percent combined effective tax rate on a charge related to the premiums paid to repurchase long term debt and the costs associated with the settlement of treasury rate locks issued in connection with the debt tender offer (refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); a zero percent effective tax rate on the remeasurement of our Venezuelan subsidiarys net assets (refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); an approximate 46 percent effective tax rate on the gain from the sale of 50 percent of our investment in Le&atilde;o Junior (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); an approximate 14 percent effective tax rate on our proportionate share of unusual tax charges, asset impairments, restructuring charges, transaction costs and a remeasurement gain recorded by equity method investees (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); a tax charge of approximately $14 million related to new legislation that changed the tax treatment of Medicare Part D subsidies (refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); a net tax charge of approximately $216 million, primarily related to deferred tax expense on certain current year undistributed foreign earnings that are not considered indefinitely reinvested (refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); and a net tax charge of approximately $67 million related to amounts required to be recorded for changes to our uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties (refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our effective tax rate of approximately 22.8 percent for the year ended December 31, 2009, included the following: an approximate 17 percent combined effective tax rate on restructuring charges, productivity initiatives and asset impairments (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); an approximate 21 percent combined effective tax rate on our proportionate share of restructuring and asset impairment charges recorded by equity method investees (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); a zero percent effective tax rate on an other than temporary impairment of a cost method investment (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); a zero percent effective tax rate on realized gains on sales of available for sale securities (refer to Note 3 and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); a tax benefit of approximately $17 million due to the impact that a tax rate change had on certain deferred tax liabilities (refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); 71 a tax charge of approximately $15 million related to the recognition of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets (refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); and a net tax benefit of approximately $13 million related to amounts required to be recorded for changes to our uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties (refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our effective tax rate of approximately 21.7 percent for the year ended December 31, 2008, included the following: an approximate 20 percent combined effective tax rate on restructuring charges, other than temporary impairments of available for sale securities, contract termination fees, productivity initiatives and asset impairments recorded by the Company (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); an approximate 23 percent combined effective tax rate on our proportionate share of asset impairment and restructuring charges recorded by equity method investees, primarily related to impairment charges recorded by CCE (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); an approximate 24 percent combined effective tax rate on gains from divestitures (refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); a tax charge of approximately $10 million related to the recognition of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets (refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); and a net tax benefit of approximately $5 million, primarily related to amounts required to be recorded for changes to our uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties (refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). As of December 31, 2010, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was approximately $387 million. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the net effect would be a benefit to the Companys effective tax rate of approximately $163 million, exclusive of any benefits related to interest and penalties. The remaining approximately $224 million, which was recorded as a deferred tax asset, primarily represents tax benefits that would be received in different tax jurisdictions in the event that the Company did not prevail on all uncertain tax positions. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A reconciliation of the changes in the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefit amounts is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Beginning balance of unrecognized tax benefits $ 354 $ 369 $ 643 Increases related to prior period tax positions 26 49 52 Decreases related to prior period tax positions (10 ) (28 ) (4 ) Increases due to current period tax positions 33 16 47 Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities (27 ) (254 ) Reductions as a result of a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations (1 ) (73 ) (36 ) Increase due to acquisition of CCEs North American business 6 Increases (decreases) from effects of exchange rates (21 ) 48 (79 ) Ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits $ 387 $ 354 $ 369 In 2008, agreements were reached between the U.S. government and a foreign government concerning the allocation of income between the two tax jurisdictions. Pursuant to these agreements, we made cash payments during the third quarter of 2008 that constituted payments of tax and interest. These payments were partially offset by tax credits taken in the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2008, and tax refunds and interest on refunds received in 2009. These benefits had been recorded as deferred tax assets in prior periods. The settlements did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated income statement for the year ended December 31, 2008. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The Company had approximately $112 million, $94 million and $110 million in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Of these amounts, approximately $17 million, $16 million and $14 million of benefits were recognized through tax expense in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the reversal of this accrual would also be a benefit to the Companys effective tax rate. Based on current tax laws, the Companys effective tax rate in 2011 is expected to be approximately 23.5 percent to 24.5 percent before considering the effect of any unusual or special items that may affect our tax rate in future years. 72  Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position We believe our ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths. The near term outlook for our business remains strong, and we expect to generate substantial cash flows from operations in 2011. As a result of our expected strong cash flows from operations, we have significant flexibility to meet our financial commitments. We typically fund a significant portion of our dividends, capital expenditures, contractual obligations, share repurchases and acquisitions with cash generated from operating activities. We rely on external funding for additional cash requirements. The Company does not typically raise capital through the issuance of stock. Instead, we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase our return on shareowners equity. Refer to the heading "Cash Flows from Financing Activities," below. Our debt financing includes the use of an extensive commercial paper program as part of our overall cash management strategy. The Company reviews its optimal mix of short term and long term debt regularly. On October 2, 2010, we acquired CCEs North American business. Under the terms of the merger agreement, the Company acquired the 67 percent of CCEs North American business that was not already owned by the Company for consideration that included: (1) the Companys 33 percent indirect ownership interest in CCEs European operations; (2) cash consideration; and (3) replacement awards issued to certain current and former employees of CCEs North American and corporate operations. At closing, CCE shareowners other than the Company exchanged their CCE common stock for common stock in a new entity, which was renamed Coca Cola Enterprises, Inc. (which is referred to herein as "New CCE") and which continues to hold the European operations held by CCE prior to the acquisition. At closing, New CCE became 100 percent owned by shareowners that held shares of common stock of CCE immediately prior to the closing, other than the Company. As a result of this transaction, the Company does not own any interest in New CCE. Although the CCE transaction was structured to be primarily cashless, under the terms of the merger agreement, we agreed to assume approximately $8.9 billion of CCE debt. In the event that the actual CCE debt on the acquisition date was less than the agreed amount, we agreed to make a cash payment to New CCE for the difference. As of the acquisition date, the debt assumed by the Company was approximately $7.9 billion. The total cash consideration paid to New CCE as part of the transaction was approximately $1.3 billion, which included approximately $1.0 billion related to the debt shortfall. On November 15, 2010, the Company issued $4,500 million of long term notes and used some of the proceeds to repurchase $2,910 million of long term debt. The remaining cash from the issuance was used to reduce our outstanding commercial paper balance. The Company recorded a charge of $342 million related to the premiums paid to repurchase the long term debt and the costs associated with the settlement of treasury rate locks issued in connection with the debt tender offer. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the Companys long term debt. In a concurrent transaction, we sold all of our ownership interests in our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE for approximately $0.9 billion in cash on October 2, 2010. The Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations were wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company prior to the divestiture. This divestiture was pursuant to the terms of the definitive agreement entered into on March 20, 2010. In addition, we granted New CCE the right to acquire our majority interest in CCEAG, 18 to 39 months after the date of the merger agreement, at the then current fair value and subject to terms and conditions as mutually agreed. In contemplation of the closing of our acquisition of CCEs North American business, we reached an agreement with DPS to distribute certain DPS brands in territories where DPS brands had been distributed by CCE prior to the CCE transaction. Under the terms of our agreement with DPS, concurrently with the closing of the CCE transaction, we entered into license agreements with DPS to distribute Dr Pepper trademark brands in the U.S., Canada Dry in the Northeast U.S., and Canada Dry and C Plus in Canada, and we made a net one time cash payment of $715 million to DPS. Under the license agreements, the Company agreed to meet certain performance obligations to distribute DPS products in retail and foodservice accounts and vending machines. The license agreements have initial terms of 20 years, with automatic 20 year renewal periods unless otherwise terminated under the terms of the agreements. The license agreements replaced agreements between DPS and CCE existing immediately prior to the completion of the CCE transaction. In addition, we entered into an agreement with DPS to include Dr Pepper and Diet Dr Pepper in our Coca Cola Freestyle fountain dispensers in certain outlets throughout the United States. The Coca Cola Freestyle agreement has a term of 20 years. 73 The Company contributed $77 million to our pension plans during the year ended December 31, 2010. In 2011, we expect to contribute $800 million to various plans, of which approximately $750 million was contributed in the first quarter of 2011. Approximately half of the expected 2011 contributions will be allocated to our primary U.S. pension plans. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The government in Venezuela has enacted certain monetary policies that restrict the ability of companies to pay dividends from retained earnings. As of December 31, 2010, cash held by our Venezuelan subsidiary accounted for approximately 2 percent of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance. In the first quarter of 2010 the Venezuelan government announced a currency devaluation and Venezuela was determined to be a hyperinflationary economy. As a result, our local subsidiary was required to use the U.S. dollar as its functional currency, and we recorded a net remeasurement loss of $103 million during the first quarter of 2010 in the line item other income (loss) net in our consolidated statement of income. As of December 31, 2010, our Venezuelan subsidiary held monetary assets of approximately $200 million. In addition to the foreign currency exchange exposure related to our Venezuelan subsidiarys net assets, we also sell concentrate to our bottling partner in Venezuela from outside the country. These sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Some of our concentrate sales were approved by the CADIVI to receive the official rate for essential goods of 2.6 bolivars per U.S. dollar prior to the elimination of the official rate for essential goods in December 2010. Prior to the elimination of the official rate for essential goods, our bottling partner in Venezuela was able to convert bolivars to U.S. dollars to settle our receivables related to sales approved by the CADIVI. Therefore, as of December 31, 2010, our receivable balance related to concentrate sales that had been approved by the CADIVI was not significant. If we are unable to utilize a government approved exchange rate mechanism for future concentrate sales to our bottling partner in Venezuela, the amount of receivables related to these sales will increase. In addition to the Companys cash balances and commercial paper program, we also maintain $4,850 million in lines of credit for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backup, of which approximately $4,597 million was unused and available as of December 31, 2010. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These backup lines of credit expire at various times from 2011 through 2012. These credit facilities are subject to normal banking terms and conditions. Some of the financial arrangements require compensating balances, none of which is presently significant to our Company. We have evaluated the financial stability of each bank and believe we can access the funds, if needed. Based on all the aforementioned factors, the Company believes its current liquidity position is strong, and we will continue to meet all our financial commitments for the foreseeable future. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $9,532 million, $8,186 million and $7,571 million, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities increased $1,346 million, or 16 percent, in 2010 compared to 2009. This increase was primarily attributable to increased receipts from customers, the impact of our acquisition of CCEs North American business, the favorable impact of exchange rates on operations and a decrease in contributions to our pension plans. The impact of these items was partially offset by higher tax payments in 2010. The increase in cash receipts from customers was primarily due to an increase in net operating revenues. Refer to the heading "Net Operating Revenues," above. Also, in 2009, cash flows from operating activities included the receipt of a $183 million special dividend from Coca Cola Hellenic. The Company contributed approximately $77 million to our pension plans during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $269 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. Cash flows from operating activities increased $615 million, or 8 percent, in 2009 compared to 2008. This increase was primarily attributable to lower tax payments, decreased payments to suppliers and vendors, and the receipt of a $183 million special dividend from Coca Cola Hellenic. The special dividend received from Coca Cola Hellenic was incremental to its normal quarterly dividend. We classified the receipt of this special dividend in cash flows from operating activities due to the fact that our cumulative equity in earnings from Coca Cola Hellenic exceeded the cumulative distributions received; therefore, the special dividend was deemed to be a return on our investment and not a return of our investment. The impact of these items was partially offset by increased contributions to our pension plans. The increase in contributions to our pension plans was primarily due to the decline in fair value of our pension 74 plan assets in 2008. The Company contributed approximately $269 million to our pension plans during the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to approximately $96 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Our cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities are summarized as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Purchases of short term investments $ (4,579 ) $ (2,130 ) $ Proceeds from disposals of short term investments 4,032 Acquisitions and investments (2,511 ) (300 ) (759 ) Purchases of other investments (132 ) (22 ) (240 ) Proceeds from disposals of bottling companies and other investments 972 240 479 Purchases of property, plant and equipment (2,215 ) (1,993 ) (1,968 ) Proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment 134 104 129 Other investing activities (106 ) (48 ) (4 ) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (4,405 ) $ (4,149 ) $ (2,363 ) Short term Investments In 2010, purchases of short term investments were $4,579 million, and proceeds from disposals of short term investments were $4,032 million. This activity resulted in a net cash outflow of $547 million during the year. In 2009, purchases of short term investments were $2,130 million. These short term investments are time deposits that have maturities of greater than three months but less than one year, and are classified in the line item short term investments in our consolidated balance sheets. The Company began investing in longer term time deposits during the fourth quarter of 2009 to match the maturities of short term debt issued as part of our commercial paper program. Refer to the heading "Cash Flows from Financing Activities," below. These time deposits are classified in the line item short term investments in our consolidated balance sheets. Acquisitions and Investments In 2010, the Companys acquisition and investment activities totaled $2,511 million, which was primarily related to our acquisition of CCEs North American business, DPS license agreements, our acquisition of OAO Nidan Juices ("Nidan"), a Russian juice company, and our additional investment in Fresh Trading Ltd. ("innocent"). The Company and the existing shareowners of innocent have a series of outstanding put and call options for the Company to potentially acquire the remaining shares not already owned by the Company. The put and call options are exercisable in stages between 2013 and 2014. Refer to the heading "Operations Review Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements," and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our acquisitions during the year. In 2009, our Companys acquisition and investment activities totaled $300 million. None of the acquisitions or investments was individually significant. Included in these investment activities was the acquisition of a minority interest in innocent. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our acquisitions during the year. In 2008, our Companys acquisition and investment activities totaled $759 million, which included the acquisition of brands and licenses in Denmark and Finland from Carlsberg Group Beverages for approximately $225 million. None of the other acquisitions during 2008 was individually significant. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Proceeds from Disposals of Bottling Companies and Other Investments In 2010, proceeds from disposals of bottling companies and other investments were $972 million. These proceeds were primarily related to the sale of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations to New CCE for approximately $0.9 billion and the sale of 50 percent of our investment in Le&atilde;o Junior for approximately $83 million. Refer to the 75 heading "Operations Review Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements," and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In 2008, proceeds from disposals of bottling companies and other investments included proceeds of approximately $275 million, net of the cash balance as of the disposal date, related to the sale of Remil to Coca Cola FEMSA. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchases of Property, Plant and Equipment Net Purchases of property, plant and equipment net of disposals for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were approximately $2,081 million, $1,889 million and $1,839 million, respectively. The increase in 2010 compared to 2009 and 2008 was primarily attributable to the acquisition of CCEs North American business. Refer to the heading "Operations Review Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements." Generally, bottling and finished products operations are more capital intensive compared to concentrate and syrup operations. Total capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment (including our investments in information technology) and the percentage of such totals by operating segment were as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Capital expenditures $ 2,215 $ 1,993 $ 1,968 Eurasia & Africa 2.7 % 3.5 % 3.4 % Europe 1.5 3.4 3.9 Latin America 4.2 6.2 2.9 North America 32.1 23.0 25.0 Pacific 4.6 4.6 9.0 Bottling Investments 42.5 41.4 41.6 Corporate 12.4 17.9 14.2 In 2011, our annual capital expenditures will increase as we integrate CCEs North American business and make investments to further enhance our operational effectiveness. The net result of these North America specific expenditures will result in an estimated increase of $1.0 billion to our 2011 capital expenditure program. In addition, we plan to make further strategic investments in 2011, primarily related to expanding our production and sales capabilities within our Bottling Investments operating segment. As a result, we expect our annual 2011 capital expenditures to range between $3.0 billion and $3.2 billion. We currently expect this level of capital expenditure to remain relatively constant for the next two years, but anticipate these levels to decrease over time. Other Investing Activities In 2010, other investing activities primarily related to the impact of the deconsolidation of certain entities due to the Companys adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. Refer to the heading "Operations Review Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements," and Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The cash flow impact in other investing activities primarily represents the balance of cash and cash equivalents on the deconsolidated entities balance sheets as of December 31, 2009. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Our cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities were as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Issuances of debt $ 15,251 $ 14,689 $ 4,337 Payments of debt (13,403 ) (12,326 ) (4,308 ) Issuances of stock 1,666 664 595 Purchases of stock for treasury (2,961 ) (1,518 ) (1,079 ) Dividends (4,068 ) (3,800 ) (3,521 ) Other financing activities 50 (2 ) (9 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (3,465 ) $ (2,293 ) $ (3,985 ) 76 Debt Financing Our Company maintains debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flows, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. We use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners equity. This exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. Our interest expense may also be affected by our credit ratings. As of December 31, 2010, our long term debt was rated "A+" by Standard & Poors, "Aa3" by Moodys and "A+" by Fitch. Our commercial paper program was rated "A 1" by Standard & Poors, "P 1" by Moodys and "F 1" by Fitch. In assessing our credit strength, all three agencies consider our capital structure (including the amount and maturity dates of our debt) and financial policies as well as the aggregated balance sheet and other financial information for the Company. In addition, some rating agencies also consider financial information for certain bottlers, including New CCE, Coca Cola Amatil, Coca Cola FEMSA and Coca Cola Hellenic. While the Company has no legal obligation for the debt of these bottlers, the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the Companys business model provides the Company with an incentive to keep these bottlers viable. It is our expectation that the credit rating agencies will continue using this methodology. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure, our major bottlers financial performance, changes in the credit rating agencies methodology in assessing our credit strength, or for any other reason, our cost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if certain bottlers credit ratings were to decline, the Companys share of equity income could be reduced as a result of the potential increase in interest expense for these bottlers. We monitor our financial ratios and, as indicated above, the rating agencies consider these ratios in assessing our credit ratings. Each rating agency employs a different aggregation methodology and has different thresholds for the various financial ratios. These thresholds are not necessarily permanent, nor are they always fully disclosed to our Company. Our global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the world, enabling us to raise funds at a low effective cost. This posture, coupled with active management of our mix of short term and long term debt and our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt, results in a lower overall cost of borrowing. Our debt management policies, in conjunction with our share repurchase programs and investment activity, can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets. Issuances and payments of debt included both short term and long term financing activities. On December 31, 2010, we had $4,850 million in lines of credit available for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backup, of which approximately $4,597 million was unused and available. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These backup lines of credit expire at various times from 2011 through 2012. In 2010, the Company had issuances of debt of $15,251 million, which included $1,171 million of net issuances of commercial paper and short term debt with maturities of 90 days or less and $9,503 million of issuances of commercial paper and short term debt with maturities greater than 90 days. In addition, on November 15, 2010, the Company issued $4,500 million of long term notes. The proceeds from the debt issuance were used to repurchase $2,910 million of long term debt, and the remainder was used to reduce our commercial paper balance. The long term notes issued on November 15, 2010, had the following general terms: $1,250 million total principal notes due May 15, 2012, at a variable interest rate of 3 month LIBOR plus 0.05 percent; $1,250 million total principal notes due November 15, 2013, at a fixed interest rate of 0.75 percent; $1,000 million total principal notes due November 15, 2015, at a fixed interest rate of 1.5 percent; and $1,000 million total principal notes due November 15, 2020, at a fixed interest rate of 3.15 percent. In 2010, the Company had payments of debt of $13,403 million, including the repurchased long term debt discussed above. Total payments of debt also included $9,667 million related to commercial paper and short term debt with maturities greater than 90 days. The Company recorded a charge of $342 million related to the premiums paid to repurchase the long term debt and the costs associated with the settlement of treasury rate locks issued in connection with the debt tender offer. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the Companys long term debt. 77  In 2009, the Company had issuances of debt of approximately $14,689 million and payments of debt of $12,326 million. The issuances of debt included approximately $12,397 million of issuances of commercial paper and short term debt with maturities greater than 90 days, as well as $900 million and $1,350 million of long term debt due March 15, 2014, and March 15, 2019, respectively. The payments of debt included approximately $1,861 million of net payments of commercial paper and short term debt with maturities of 90 days or less; $10,017 million related to commercial paper and short term debt with maturities greater than 90 days; and $448 million related to long term debt. The increase in issuances and payments of commercial paper with maturities of greater than 90 days was primarily due to a favorable interest rate environment on longer term commercial paper. As a result, the Company also began investing in longer term time deposits that have maturities of greater than three months. Refer to the heading "Cash Flows from Investing Activities." The issuances of debt in 2008 included approximately $4,001 million of issuances of commercial paper and short term debt with maturities of greater than 90 days, and approximately $194 million of net issuances of commercial paper and short term debt with maturities of 90 days or less. The payments of debt in 2008 included approximately $4,032 million related to commercial paper and short term debt with maturities of greater than 90 days. Issuances of Stock The issuances of stock in 2010, 2009 and 2008 primarily related to the exercise of stock options by Company employees. Share Repurchases On July 20, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a share repurchase program of up to 300 million shares of the Companys common stock. The program took effect on October 31, 2006. The table below presents annual shares repurchased and average price per share: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Number of shares repurchased (in millions) 49 26 18 Average price per share $ 63.85 $ 57.09 $ 58.01 Since the inception of our initial share repurchase program in 1984 through our current program as of December 31, 2010, we have purchased approximately 1.4 billion shares of our Companys common stock at an average price per share of $21.37. In addition to shares repurchased under the stock repurchase plans authorized by our Board of Directors, the Companys treasury stock activity also includes shares surrendered to the Company to pay the exercise price and or to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with so called stock swap exercises of employee stock options and or the vesting of restricted stock issued to employees. In 2010, we repurchased approximately $3.1 billion of our stock, of which $3.0 billion settled prior to December 31, 2010. We currently expect to repurchase an additional $2.0 billion to $2.5 billion of our stock during 2011. Dividends At its February 2011 meeting, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 7 percent, raising it to $0.47 per share, equivalent to a full year dividend of $1.88 per share in 2011. This is our 49th consecutive annual increase. Our annual common stock dividend was $1.76 per share, $1.64 per share and $1.52 per share in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The 2010 dividend represented a 7 percent increase from 2009, and the 2009 dividend represented an 8 percent increase from 2008. 78 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In accordance with the definition under SEC rules, the following qualify as off balance sheet arrangements: any obligation under certain guarantee contracts; a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets; any obligation under certain derivative instruments; and any obligation arising out of a material variable interest held by the registrant in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the registrant, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the registrant. As of December 31, 2010, we were contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties of approximately $683 million, of which approximately $336 million related to VIEs. These guarantees primarily are related to third party customers, bottlers, vendors and container manufacturing operations and have arisen through the normal course of business. These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees was individually significant. The amount represents the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make under the guarantees; however, we do not consider it probable that we will be required to satisfy these guarantees. Management concluded that the likelihood of any significant amounts being paid by our Company under these guarantees is not probable. As of December 31, 2010, we were not directly liable for the debt of any unconsolidated entity, and we did not have any retained or contingent interest in assets as defined above. Our Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had $4,850 million in lines of credit for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backup, of which $4,597 million was unused and available. While no amounts have been borrowed against these lines of credit, certain portions have been limited due to outstanding letters of credit related to collateral for claims incurred under our self insurance programs and for certain operating activities. These backup lines of credit expire at various times from 2011 through 2012. These credit facilities are subject to normal banking terms and conditions. Some of the financial arrangements require compensating balances, none of which is presently significant to our Company. 79 Aggregate Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2010, the Companys contractual obligations, including payments due by period, were as follows (in millions): Payments Due by Period Total 2011 20122013 20142015 2016 and Thereafter Short term loans and notes payable1: Commercial paper borrowings $ 7,535 $ 7,535 $ $ $ Lines of credit and other short term borrowings 565 565 Current maturities of long term debt2 1,266 1,266 Long term debt, net of current maturities2 13,076 3,800 3,392 5,884 Estimated interest payments3 7,686 696 1,282 1,027 4,681 Accrued income taxes4 273 273 Purchase obligations5 12,463 7,615 2,628 1,053 1,167 Marketing obligations6 4,557 1,652 1,691 468 746 Lease obligations 1,155 238 386 218 313 Total contractual obligations4 $ 48,576 $ 19,840 $ 9,787 $ 6,158 $ 12,791 1 Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding short term loans and notes payable. Upon payment of outstanding commercial paper, we typically issue new commercial paper. Lines of credit and other short term borrowings are expected to fluctuate depending upon current liquidity needs, especially at international subsidiaries. 2 Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding long term debt. We will consider several alternatives to settle this long term debt, including the use of cash flows from operating activities, issuance of commercial paper or issuance of other long term debt. 3 We calculated estimated interest payments for our long term fixed rate debt based on the applicable rates and payment dates. We typically expect to settle such interest payments with cash flows from operating activities and or short term borrowings. 4 Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding income taxes. As of December 31, 2010, the noncurrent portion of our income tax liability, including accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, was approximately $474 million, which was not included in the total above. At this time, the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of our income tax liability cannot be determined. In addition, any payments related to unrecognized tax benefits would be partially offset by reductions in payments in other jurisdictions. 5 Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including long term contractual obligations, open purchase orders, accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities. We expect to fund these obligations with cash flows from operating activities. 6 We expect to fund these marketing obligations with cash flows from operating activities. The total accrued benefit liability for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of December 31, 2010, was approximately $2,563 million. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This amount is impacted by, among other items, pension expense, funding levels, plan amendments, changes in plan demographics and assumptions, and the investment return on plan assets. Because the accrued liability does not represent expected liquidity needs, we did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 ("PPA") was enacted in August 2006 and established, among other things, new standards for funding of U.S. defined benefit pension plans. During 2008, the funded status of the Companys primary U.S. defined benefit pension plan declined as a result of the overall stock market decline. In early 2009, the Company contributed approximately $175 million to this plan. Subsequent to this contribution, the plan is sufficiently funded to maintain maximum flexibility as outlined in the PPA. We generally expect to fund all future contributions with cash flows from operating activities. Our international pension plans are generally funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations. In 2011, we expect to contribute approximately $800 million to various plans, of which approximately $750 million was contributed in the first quarter of 2011. Approximately half of the expected 2011 contributions will be allocated to our primary U.S. pension plans. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We did not include our estimated contributions to our various plans in the table above. As of December 31, 2010, the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. qualified pension plans was $4,837 million, and the fair value of plan assets was approximately $4,118 million. The majority of this underfunding was due to the negative impact that the recent credit crisis and financial system instability had on the value of our pension plan assets. 80 As of December 31, 2010, the projected benefit obligation of all pension plans other than the U.S. qualified pension plans was approximately $2,455 million, and the fair value of all other pension plan assets was approximately $1,379 million. The majority of this underfunding is attributable to an international pension plan for certain non U.S. employees that is unfunded due to tax law restrictions, as well as our unfunded U.S. nonqualified pension plans. These U.S. nonqualified pension plans provide, for certain associates, benefits that are not permitted to be funded through a qualified plan because of limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The expected benefit payments for these unfunded pension plans are not included in the table above. However, we anticipate annual benefit payments for these unfunded pension plans to be approximately $50 million in 2011 and remain near that level through 2030, decreasing annually thereafter. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In general, we are self insured for large portions of many different types of claims; however, we do use commercial insurance above our self insured retentions to reduce the Companys risk of catastrophic loss. Our reserves for the Companys self insured losses are estimated through actuarial procedures of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions, adjusted for our specific expectations based on our claim history. As of December 31, 2010, our self insurance reserves totaled approximately $502 million. Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We did not include estimated payments related to our self insurance reserves in the table above. Deferred income tax liabilities as of December 31, 2010, were approximately $4,279 million. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This amount is not included in the total contractual obligations table because we believe this presentation would not be meaningful. Deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective book bases, which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts. The results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods. As a result, scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading, because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs. Foreign Exchange Our international operations are subject to certain opportunities and risks, including currency fluctuations and governmental actions. We closely monitor our operations in each country and seek to adopt appropriate strategies that are responsive to changing economic and political environments, and to fluctuations in foreign currencies. We use 75 functional currencies. Due to our global operations, weakness in some of these currencies might be offset by strength in others. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, the weighted average exchange rates for foreign currencies in which the Company conducted operations (all operating currencies), and for certain individual currencies, strengthened (weakened) against the U.S. dollar as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 All operating currencies 3 % (9 )% 5 % Brazilian real 11 % (8 )% 6 % Mexican peso 6 (24 ) 0 Australian dollar 13 (8 ) 1 South African rand 11 (1 ) (18 ) British pound (2 ) (18 ) (9 ) Euro (5 ) (8 ) 9 Japanese yen 6 9 12 These percentages do not include the effects of our hedging activities and, therefore, do not reflect the actual impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on our operating results. Our foreign currency management program is designed to mitigate, over time, a portion of the impact of exchange rate changes on our net income and earnings per share. The total currency impact on operating income, including the effect of our hedging activities, was an increase of approximately 3 percent in 2010 and a decrease of approximately 11 percent in 2009. Based on the anticipated impact of hedging coverage in place, the Company expects currencies to have an even to slightly positive impact on operating income for the first quarter and full year of 2011. 81 Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies. The effects of the remeasurement of these assets and liabilities are partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are included as a component of other income (loss) net in our consolidated financial statements. Refer to the heading "Operations Review Other Income (Loss) Net." The Company recorded foreign currency losses of $148 million and $34 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company recorded a foreign currency gain of $24 million in 2008. The remeasurement loss recorded in 2010 was primarily related to our Venezuelan subsidiary. Subsequent to December 31, 2009, the Venezuelan government announced a currency devaluation, and Venezuela was determined to be a hyperinflationary economy. As a result, our local subsidiary was required to use the U.S. dollar as its functional currency and we recorded a net remeasurement loss of approximately $103 million during the first quarter of 2010, in the line item other income (loss) net in our consolidated statement of income. The Company will continue to manage its foreign currency exposure to mitigate, over time, a portion of the impact of exchange rate changes on net income and earnings per share. 82  Overview of Financial Position In 2010, the Company had a number of significant transactions and events that impacted our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to the heading "Operations Review Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and New License Agreements," for additional information related to these transactions and events. The most significant impact on our consolidated balance sheet was related to our acquisition of CCEs North American business, which resulted in the Company recording total assets of approximately $22.2 billion as of the acquisition date. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a preliminary allocation of the purchase price by major class of assets and liabilities. The majority of the fluctuations in individual line items in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2010, compared to our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2009, were attributable to this acquisition. The following table illustrates the change in the individual line items of the Companys consolidated balance sheet (in millions): December 31, 2010 2009 Change Cash and cash equivalents $ 8,517 $ 7,021 $ 1,496 Short term investments 2,682 2,130 552 Marketable securities 138 62 76 Trade accounts receivable net 4,430 3,758 672 Inventories 2,650 2,354 296 Prepaid expenses and other assets 3,162 2,226 936 Equity method investments 6,954 6,217 737 Other investments, principally bottling companies 631 538 93 Other assets 2,121 1,976 145 Property, plant and equipment net 14,727 9,561 5,166 Trademarks with indefinite lives 6,356 6,183 173 Bottlers franchise rights with indefinite lives 7,511 1,953 5,558 Goodwill 11,665 4,224 7,441 Other intangible assets 1,377 468 909 Total assets $ 72,921 $ 48,671 $ 24,250 Accounts payable and accrued expenses $ 8,859 $ 6,657 $ 2,202 Loans and notes payable 8,100 6,749 1,351 Current maturities of long term debt 1,276 51 1,225 Accrued income taxes 273 264 9 Long term debt 14,041 5,059 8,982 Other liabilities 4,794 2,965 1,829 Deferred income taxes 4,261 1,580 2,681 Total liabilities 41,604 23,325 18,279 Net assets $ 31,317 $ 25,346 $ 5,971 1 1 Includes a decrease in net assets of $947 million resulting from translation adjustments in various balance sheet accounts. The table above includes the impact of the following transactions and events: Property, plant and equipment net increased $5,166 million, primarily due to the $5,385 million of property, plant and equipment acquired in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business. The impact of this acquisition was partially offset by a decrease of $315 million due to the disposal of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations and a decrease of $400 million related to the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of our adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. Refer to Note 1 and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Bottlers franchise rights with indefinite lives increased $5,558 million, primarily due to the $5,100 million of indefinite lived franchise rights we reacquired in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business and $865 million related to DPS license agreements. The impact of the previously mentioned items was partially offset by the impact of the deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of our adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB. Goodwill increased $7,441 million, primarily due to $7,746 million of goodwill recognized in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business. The acquired goodwill was partially offset by the impact of the 83 deconsolidation of certain entities as a result of our adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB and the disposal of our Norwegian and Swedish bottling operations. Refer to Note 1 and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other intangible assets increased $909 million, primarily due to $605 million of definite lived franchise rights and $380 million of customer rights we acquired in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased $2,202 million, primarily due to the $1,826 million of accounts payable and accrued expenses assumed in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase also reflects additional accrued liabilities related to our stock repurchase program for shares purchased but not settled as of December 31, 2010. Loans and notes payable increased $1,351 million, primarily related to an increase in short term borrowings to fund the cash payment made in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Current maturities of long term debt increased $1,225 million, primarily related to an increase in our overall debt balance as a result of our acquisition of CCEs North American business. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Long term debt increased $8,982 million, primarily due to long term debt assumed in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business. Refer to the heading "Cash Flows from Financing Activities," above, and Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other liabilities increased $1,829 million, primarily due to pension and other postretirement liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business. The assumed liabilities consisted of benefit obligations of $3,544 million and plan assets of $2,231 million as of the acquisition date. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to pension and other postretirement plans assumed from CCE. Deferred income taxes increased $2,681 million, primarily due to deferred tax liabilities recorded on the franchise rights acquired in connection with our acquisition of CCEs North American business. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices Inflation affects the way we operate in many markets around the world. In general, we believe that, over time, we are able to increase prices to counteract the majority of the inflationary effects of increasing costs and to generate sufficient cash flows to maintain our productive capability. 84   ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and other market risks. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. As a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure. Because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure, fluctuations in the value of the instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure. The Company generally hedges anticipated exposures up to 36 months in advance; however, the majority of our derivative instruments expire within 24 months or less. Virtually all of our derivatives are straightforward over the counter instruments with liquid markets. We monitor our exposure to financial market risks using several objective measurement systems. In prior years, the Company primarily used the value at risk methodology for its quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. However, with the Companys acquisition of CCEs North American business in 2010, and the related changes to our consolidated balance sheet, the Company has provided a sensitivity analysis to measure our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and commodity prices. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our hedging transactions and derivative financial instruments. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates We manage most of our foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows us to net certain exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets. In 2010, we generated approximately 70 percent of our net operating revenues from operations outside the United States; therefore, weakness in one particular currency might be offset by strengths in other currencies over time. We use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to currency fluctuations. Our Company enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases currency options (principally euro and Japanese yen) and collars to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. Additionally, we enter into forward exchange contracts to offset the earnings impact related to exchange rate fluctuations on certain monetary assets and liabilities. We also enter into forward exchange contracts as hedges of net investments in international operations. The total notional value of our foreign currency derivatives was $6.3 billion and $4.6 billion as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. This total includes derivative instruments that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting as well as economic hedges. The fair value of the contracts that qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a liability of $109 million as of December 31, 2010. At the end of 2010, we estimate that an unfavorable 10 percent change in the exchange rates would have increased our net unrealized losses by $395 million. Likewise, the fair value of the contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a liability of $79 million, and we estimate that an unfavorable 10 percent change in rates would have increased our net losses by $244 million. All losses were offset by changes in the underlying hedged item, resulting in no net material impact on earnings. Interest Rates We monitor our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt, as well as our mix of short term debt versus long term debt. From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt. Based on the Companys variable rate debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2010, a 1 percentage point increase versus the market interest rates available on December 31, 2010 would result in an additional $123 million of interest expense. However, the impact to our consolidated statement of income would have been partially offset by the increase in interest income related to higher interest rates. Commodity Prices The Company is subject to market risk with respect to commodity price fluctuations, principally related to our purchases of aluminum and plastic, sweeteners, and energy. Whenever possible, we manage our exposure to commodity risks primarily through the use of supplier pricing agreements that enable us to establish the purchase prices for certain inputs that are used in our manufacturing and distribution business. We also use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to commodity risks at times. Certain of these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, but 85 they are effective economic hedges that help the Company mitigate the price risk associated with the purchases of materials used in our manufacturing processes and the fuel used to operate our extensive vehicle fleet. Open commodity derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting had a notional value of $28 million as of December 31, 2010. These contracts had a fair value of $2 million. The potential change in fair value of these commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10 percent decrease in underlying commodity prices, would have eliminated the net unrealized gain and created an unrealized loss of $2 million. Open commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting had a notional value of $425 million as of December 31, 2010. These contracts had a fair value of $56 million. The potential change in fair value of these commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10 percent decrease in underlying commodity prices, would have reduced our net gain by $31 million. 86
