ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BUSINESS COMBINATIONS On May 27, 1999, Kroger issued 312 million shares of Kroger common stock in connection with a merger, for all of the outstanding common stock of Fred Meyer Inc., which operated stores primarily in the Western region of the United States. The merger was accounted for as a pooling of interest, and the accompanying financial statements have been restated to give effect to the consolidated results of Kroger and Fred Meyer for all years presented. COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM On January 29, 1997, we began repurchasing common stock in order to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans. These repurchases were made using the proceeds, including the tax benefit, from options exercised. The Board of Directors authorized further repurchases of up to $100 million of common stock in October 1997. On October 18, 1998, we rescinded the repurchase program as a result of execution of the merger agreement between Kroger and Fred Meyer. In December 1999, we began a new program to repurchase common stock to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans. This program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises, including the tax benefit. In January 2000, the Board of Directors authorized an additional repurchase plan for up to $100 million of common stock. During fiscal 1999, we made open market purchases of approximately $4 million under the stock option program and $2 million under the $100 million program. On March 31, 2000, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $750 million of Kroger common stock. This repurchase program replaced the $100 million program authorized in January 2000. During fiscal 2000, we made open market purchases of approximately $43 million under the stock option program and $539 million under the $750 million program. On March 1, 2001, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an incremental $1 billion of Kroger common stock. This repurchase program was in addition to the $750 million stock buyback plan. During fiscal 2001, we made open market purchases of approximately $180 million under the stock option program and $209 million to complete the $750 million program. We also made open market purchases of $343 million under the $1 billion authorization. Purchases of stock under the Board approved repurchase programs are made when the expected return exceeds our cost of capital. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Capital expenditures excluding acquisitions totaled $2.1 billion in 2001 compared to $1.6 billion in 2000 and $1.7 billion in 1999, most amounts were used to construct new stores. The table below shows our supermarket storing activity: 2001 2000 1999 Beginning of year 2,354 2,288 2,191 Opened 59 59 100 Acquired 34 45 78 Closed (29 ) (38 ) (81 ) End of year 2,418 2,354 2,288 8 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion summarizes our operating results for 2001 compared to 2000 and 2000 compared to 1999. However, 2001 results are not directly comparable to 2000 results and 2000 results are not directly comparable to 1999 results due to a 53 week year in 2000 and acquisitions. Sales Total sales for the 52 weeks of 2001 were $50.1 billion compared to $49.0 billion for the 53 weeks of 2000 and $45.4 billion for the 52 weeks of 1999. These sales amounts represent annual increases of 2.2% in 2001 and 8.0% in 2000. Excluding sales from divested stores and adjusting for the estimated effect of a 53rd week of sales in 2000, annual increases would have been 4.2% in 2001 and 6.0% in 2000. The weak economy and competitive pressures affected total sales in 2001, while the 2000 increase resulted from strong store operations. Identical food store sales (stores in operation and not expanded or relocated for four full quarters) increased 0.9% in 2001 and 1.5% in 2000. Comparable food store sales, which include expansions and relocations, increased 1.5% in 2001 and 1.9% in 2000. Excluding sales at supermarket fuel centers, identical food store sales increased 0.4% and comparable food store sales increased 0.9% in 2001. Gross Profit Coordinated purchasing, category management, technology related efficiencies and increases in corporate brand sales have enabled us to increase our gross profit to 27.35% of sales in 2001, from 26.93% in 2000, and 26.54% in 1999. Excluding one time expenses (described in Merger Related Costs and One Time Expenses below) and the effect of LIFO, gross profit as a percent of sales increased to 27.42% in 2001, from 26.99% in 2000 and 26.60% in 1999. Operating, General and Administrative Expenses Operating, general and administrate expenses as a percent of sales were 18.93% in 2001, 18.68% in 2000, and 18.36% in 1999. Excluding one time expenses (described in Merger Related Costs and One Time Expenses below), operating, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 18.65% in 2001, 18.46% in 2000 and 18.30% in 1999. These costs as a percent of sales increased due to higher health care and energy costs in 2001 and 2000. Credit card fees as a percent of sales also increased in 2001. These increased costs offset significant productivity gains at the store level. EBITDA Our bank credit facilities and the indentures underlying our publicly issued debt contain various restrictive covenants. Many of these covenants are based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, LIFO charge, extraordinary loss, and one time items (EBITDA). The ability to generate EBITDA at levels sufficient to satisfy the requirements of these agreements is a key measure of our financial strength. We do not intend the presentation of EBITDA to be an alternative to any generally accepted accounting principle measure of performance. Presentation of EBITDA is based on the definition contained in our bank credit facilities. This may be a different definition than other companies use. We were in compliance with all EBITDA based bank credit facility and indenture covenants on February 2, 2002. 9 EBITDA for 2001 increased 5.8% to $3,742 million from $3,536 million in 2000. EBITDA for 2000 increased 13.2% from $3,124 million in 1999, without adjusting for the extra week in 2000. These EBITDA increases were primarily due to economies of scale resulting from increased sales, efficiencies described in Gross Profit above, returns from capital investments and returns from recent acquisitions. The following is a summary of the calculation of EBITDA for the 2001, 2000, and 1999 fiscal years: 2001 (52 weeks) 2000 (53 weeks)  1999 (52 weeks) (In millions) Earnings before tax expense $ 1,711 $ 1,508 $ 1,102 Interest 648 675 637 Depreciation 973 907 847 Goodwill amortization 103 101 99 LIFO 23 (6 ) (29 ) One time items included in merchandise costs 12 37 58 One time items included in operating, general and administrative expenses 140 108 27 Merger related costs 4 15 383 Restructuring charges 37 Impairment charges 91 191 EBITDA $ 3,742 $ 3,536 $ 3,124 Income Taxes Our effective tax rate decreased to 39.1% in 2001 from 41.6% in 2000 and 43.5% in 1999. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 2000 to 2001 was due to the write off of non deductible goodwill in 2000 and a lower effective state income tax rate in 2001. The decrease from 1999 to 2000 was due primarily to the absence of non deductible transaction costs in 2000. 10 Net Earnings Net earnings and the effects of merger related costs, one time expenses and extraordinary losses for the three years ended February 2, 2002, were: 2001 (52 weeks) 2000 (53 weeks) 1999 (52 weeks)  (In millions) Net earnings $ 1,043 $ 877 $ 613 Extraordinary loss, net of income tax benefit 3 10 Earnings before extraordinary loss 1,043 880 623 Tax benefit due to effect of merger related costs, one time expenses, impairment charges, and restructuring charges (110 ) (101 ) (142 ) One time expenses 152 145 85 Merger related costs 4 15 383 Restructuring charges 37 Impairment charges 91 191 Earnings before extraordinary loss excluding merger related costs, one time expenses, impairment charges, and restructuring charges $ 1,217 $ 1,130 $ 949 Diluted earnings per share before extraordinary loss $ 1.26 $ 1.04 $ 0.73 Diluted earnings per share before extraordinary loss excluding merger related costs, one time expenses, impairment charges, and restructuring charges $ 1.48 $ 1.34 $ 1.11 MERGER RELATED COSTS AND ONE TIME EXPENSES We are continuing to implement our integration plan relating to recent mergers. The integration plan includes distribution consolidation, systems integration, store conversions, store closures and administration integration. Total pre tax merger related costs were $4 million in 2001, $15 million in 2000 and $383 million in 1999. In addition to merger related costs that are shown separately on the Consolidated Statement of Income, we incurred other pre tax one time expenses that are included in merchandise costs and operating, general and administrative expenses. One time expenses in 2001 included $81 million of losses on energy purchase contracts and $20 million of lease liabilities related to store closings. Expenses in 2000 also included $67 million of lease liabilities for store closings. Remaining one time expenses incurred during 2001 and 2000, and the 1999 expenses, were costs related to recent mergers. During 2001 and 2000, we recorded pre tax impairment charges of $91 million and $191 million, respectively. In 2000, we performed an impairment review due to new divisional leadership and updated profitability forecasts for 2000 and beyond. In 2001, we performed an impairment review due to recent investments by acquired companies in stores that did not perform as expected and updated profitability forecasts for 2002 and beyond. In both years we identified impairment losses for assets to be disposed of and assets to be held and used. In 2000, we also identified impairment losses for certain investments in former suppliers that have experienced financial difficulty and with whom supply arrangements have ceased. The 2001 charge relates to locations that either had not opened, or had only recently opened, when the 2000 impairment review was performed. As a result, estimates of future operating performance for these locations were not determined at that time. 11 Kroger also recorded a pre tax $37 million restructuring charge in 2001 primarily for severance agreements associated with its Strategic Growth Plan announced in December 2001. The table below details all of our merger related costs and one time items: 2001 2000 1999 (In millions) Merger related costs $ 4 $ 15 $ 383 One time items related to mergers included in: Merchandise costs 12 37 58 Operating, general and administrative 39 41 27 Other one time items included in: Operating, general and administrative store closings 20 67 Operating, general and administrative energy contracts 81 Total one time items 152 145 85 Restructuring charges 37 Impairment charges 91 191 Total merger related costs and other one time items $ 284 $ 351 $ 468 Please refer to footnotes 3, 4, 5 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on these items. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position, and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner. The significant accounting policies are summarized in footnote 1 to the consolidated financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Workers Compensation Costs We primarily are self insured for costs related to workers compensation claims. Liabilities are recognized based on claims filed, and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. These liabilities are actuarially determined on a discounted basis. We have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis. We are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits. 12 The assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability, which can affect the liability recorded for such claims. For example, variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in such claims can impact amounts realized. Similarly, changes in legal trends and interpretations, as well as a change in the nature and method of how such claims ultimately are settled can impact ultimate costs. Although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables, such changes could have a considerable impact on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities. Asset Impairments We monitor the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger events have occurred, such as current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset. When a trigger event occurs, an impairment calculation is performed, comparing projected undiscounted cash flows utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores to the carrying value for those stores. If impairment is identified for long lived assets other than real property, we compare discounted future cash flows to the assets current carrying value and record impairment when the carrying value exceeds the discounted cash flows. With respect to owned property and equipment associated with closed stores, the value of the property and equipment is adjusted to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions. Impairment is recognized for the excess of carrying value over estimated fair market value, reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal. Any reductions in the carrying value of assets resulting from the application of this policy are reflected in the income statement as asset impairment charges. Goodwill Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, became effective for Kroger on February 3, 2002. Adoption of this standard will change our method of accounting for goodwill, which totaled $3,594 million as of February 2, 2002. Goodwill no longer will be amortized and instead will be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis. Goodwill amortization expense totaled $103 million in 2001. Non amortization of goodwill will improve fiscal 2002 net earnings by approximately $96 million. We will review goodwill for impairment at the operating division level. Generally, fair value will represent a multiple of EBITDA, as defined above in Results of Operations, or discounted projected future cash flows and will be compared to the carrying value of a division for purposes of identifying potential impairment. If potential for impairment is identified, the fair value of a division will be measured against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities, excluding goodwill, to estimate an implied fair value of the divisions goodwill. Goodwill impairment will be recognized for any excess of the carrying value of the divisions goodwill over the implied fair value. The annual impairment review required by SFAS No. 142 requires extensive uses of accounting judgment and financial estimates. Application of alternative assumptions and definitions, such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different organizational level, could produce significantly different results. We currently are performing our initial goodwill impairment review at the operating division level to determine the effect the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements. 13 Store Closing Costs We provide for closed store liabilities relating to the present value of the estimated remaining noncancelable lease payments after the anticipated closing date, net of estimated subtenant income. We estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining rent payments on closed stores. The closed store liabilities usually are paid over the lease terms associated with the closed stores, which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to 25 years. As of February 2, 2002, closed store lease liabilities totaled $234 million. For stores we intend to sell, we actively market the stores to potential buyers. Stores held for disposal are reduced to their estimated net realizable value. The value of any equipment and leasehold improvements related to a closed store is reduced to reflect recoverable values. Although we estimate subtenant income, future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the store expected to be closed is located, our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions, the ultimate cost of disposition for these leases and related assets is affected by specific real estate markets, inflation rates, and general economic conditions. Store closings generally are completed within one year after the decision to close. Adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenants and actual exit costs differing from original estimates. Adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known. Any excess store closing liability remaining upon settlement of the obligation is reversed to income in the period that such settlement is determined. Other costs related to closed store locations are reflected in the income statement as operating, general and administrative costs. Reductions in the carrying value of equipment and leasehold improvements related to a closed store are reflected in the income statement as asset impairment charges in accordance with our policy on asset impairments. Inventory write downs, if any, in connection with store closings, are classified in merchandise costs. Costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores are expensed as incurred. Store closing liabilities are reviewed quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs, or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose, is adjusted to income in the proper period. Purchase commitments From time to time, we enter into purchase commitments for various resources, including raw materials utilized in our manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in our stores, manufacturing facilities and administrative offices. Upon entering into these commitments, and on a quarterly basis thereafter, we evaluate the companys expectation to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of our normal course of business. Those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in our normal course of business qualify as normal purchases and normal sales. For any commitments for which we do not expect to utilize or take delivery and, as a result, will require net settlement, the contracts are marked to fair value on a quarterly basis. Benefit Plans The determination of our obligation and expense for pension and other post retirement benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. Those assumptions are described in footnote 18 to the consolidated financial statements and include, among others, the discount rate, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rates of increase in compensation and healthcare costs. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions materially may affect our pension and 14 other post retirement obligations and our future expense. Footnote 18 to the consolidated financial statements discusses the impact of a 1% change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other post retirement benefit costs and the related liability. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (principally on a last in, first out, LIFO, basis) or market. In total, approximately 94% of inventories for 2001 and 2000 were valued using the LIFO method. Approximately 61% of inventories in 2001 were valued using the LIFO item cost method and approximately 33% were valued using the LIFO retail method. We will evaluate the benefits of converting the remaining divisions to the item cost method in the near future. Cost for the balance of the inventories is determined using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. Replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by $340 million at February 2, 2002, and $319 million at February 3, 2001. We evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities. We record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of these counts to provide for estimated shortages as of the balance sheet date. Revenue Recognition Revenues from the sale of products are recognized at the point of sale of our products. Discounts provided to customers at the point of sale are recognized as a reduction in sales as the products are sold. Merchandise Costs Vendor rebates, credits and promotional allowances that relate to our buying and merchandising activities, including lump sum payments associated with long term contracts, are recorded as a component of merchandise costs as they are earned, in accordance with the underlying agreement. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flow Information Cash from operations was $2,347 million in 2001 compared to $2,359 million in 2000 and $1,462 million in 1999. Increased earnings in 2001 were offset by increases in the use of cash for working capital. The increase in 2000 was due to an increase in earnings and our efforts to reduce net operating working capital and improve cash flow. Cash used by investing activities was $1,965 million in 2001 compared to $1,601 million in 2000 and $1,724 million in 1999. The increase in 2001 was due to increased capital spending. The decrease in 2000 was primarily related to our storing activity and asset acquisitions. During 2001, 2000, and 1999 we had capital expenditures excluding acquisitions of $2,139 million, $1,623 million, and $1,691 million, respectively. We spent $103 million for acquisitions during 2001 compared to $67 million in 2000 and $230 million in 1999. We opened, acquired, expanded, or relocated 146 food stores in 2001, 150 food stores in 2000, and 197 food stores in 1999. During those same periods, we remodeled 99, 115, and 142 food stores, respectively. Cash used by financing activities was $382 million in 2001 compared to $878 million in 2000. Financing activities provided cash of $280 million in 1999. The decrease in the use of cash in 2001 primarily was due to increased borrowings in 2001, offset by increased treasury stock purchases. The decrease in cash during 2000 was due to a decrease in the amount borrowed and an increase in the treasury shares purchased during 2000. 15 Debt Management We have several lines of credit totaling approximately $3.5 billion. Borrowings of approximately $1.4 billion at February 2, 2002, primarily commercial paper borrowings, reduce the funds available under our lines of credit. In addition, we are a party to a $393 million synthetic lease credit facility at February 2, 2002, as further described below in Factors Affecting Liquidity. Total debt, including both the current and long term portions of capital leases, increased $302 million to $8.8 billion in 2001 and decreased $468 million to $8.5 billion in 2000. The increase in 2001 was due to an increase in capital spending, stock repurchase programs and working capital. The decrease in 2000 was due to the use of free cash flow to pay down outstanding debt balances. We purchased a portion of the debt issued by the lenders of some structured financings in an effort to reduce our effective interest expense. We also prefunded employee benefit costs of $270 million at year end 2001, $208 million at year end 2000, and $200 million at year end 1999. If we exclude the debt incurred to make these purchases, which we classify as investments, and the prefunding of employee benefits, our net total debt would have been $8.5 billion at year end 2001, compared to $8.3 billion at year end 2000 and $8.7 billion at year end 1999. In addition to the available credit mentioned above, as of February 2, 2002, we had available for issuance $1.25 billion of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and declared effective on November 13, 2001. Subsequent Events On March 26, 2002, we issued $500 million, 6.75% Senior Notes due in 2012. We also entered into two pay variable interest rate swap agreements, with notional amounts totaling $500 million, expiring in 2012. Factors Affecting Liquidity We currently borrow on a daily basis approximately $700 to $900 million under our unrated commercial paper (CP) program. These borrowings are backed by our credit facilities, and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facilities. If our credit rating was to decline below its current level of BBB /Baa3, the ability to borrow under the CP program could be adversely affected, causing us to have to borrow additional funds under the credit facilities. Borrowings under the credit facilities may be more costly than the money we borrow under our current CP program, depending on the current interest rate environment. However, because our CP program is unrated, we do not anticipate significant difficulties in continuing our CP program in the event of a downgrade of our rated debt. Although our ability to borrow under the credit facilities is not affected by our credit rating, the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facilities would be affected not only by a decrease in our credit rating, but also a decrease in our Applicable Percentage Ratio (the ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated total interest expense, as defined in the credit facilities). If our credit rating would be downgraded one level or if our Applicable Percentage Ratio were to decrease from 5.98 to 1, at February 2, 2002, to below 4.00 to 1, the cost of our borrowings under the credit facilities would increase at least 0.25%. If our year end 2001 net debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio of 2.34 to 1 were to be higher than 3.50 to 1, or our 2001 fixed charge coverage ratio (the ratio of consolidated EBITDA plus rent expense to consolidated interest expense plus rent expense) of 3.42 to 1 would fall below 1.70 to 1, we would be in default of our credit facilities. 16 The tables below illustrate our significant contractual and other commercial commitments as of year end 2001 (in millions of dollars): Contractual Obligations 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 Thereafter Total Long term debt $ 410 $ 1,281 $ 290 $ 801 $ 960 $ 4,695 $ 8,437 Capital lease obligations, net of interest 26 24 23 23 23 292 411 Operating lease obligations 766 727 691 653 609 4,746 8,192 Construction commitments 246 246 Unconditional purchaseobligations 379 138 104 100 86 6 813 $ 1,827 $ 2,170 $ 1,108 $ 1,577 $ 1,678 $ 9,739 $ 18,099 Other Commercial Commitments Credit facilities (1) $ $ 948 $ $ $ 420 $ $ 1,368 Standby letters of credit 59 9 4 72 Guarantees of joint venture debt 8 8 Synthetic lease guarantee (2) 393 393 $ 67 $ 1,350 $ 4 $ $ 420 $ $ 1,841 (1) These borrowings also are included in the long term debt contractual obligation amounts (2) Estimated rent payments of approximately $13 million and $1 million in 2002 and 2003, respectively, are included in the operating lease contractual obligation amounts Our unconditional purchase obligations include purchase commitments to be utilized in the normal course of business, such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our manufacturing plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and manufacturing facilities. These purchase obligations also include management fees for certain facilities operated by third parties. We maintain three bank credit facilities. The obligations under the $1,875 million Senior Credit Facility are guaranteed by Kroger and our material subsidiaries as defined in the facility. The revolving portion of the Senior Credit Facility is available for general corporate purposes, including the support of Fred Meyers commercial paper program. This agreement expires in February 2003. We also maintain an $812.5 million facility that expires in May 2006, and an $812.5 million 364 day facility that expires in May 2002. We currently are involved in negotiations to refinance the current 364 day facility and the $1,875 million Senior Credit Facility with new 364 day and five year facilities in an aggregate amount not expected to exceed $2.2 billion. Unrated commercial paper borrowings of $799 million and borrowings under money market lines of $100 million at February 2, 2002, have been classified as long term because we expect that these borrowings will be refinanced using the same type of securities. Additionally, we have the ability to refinance these borrowings on a long term basis and have presented the amounts as outstanding under the credit facilities. Approximately $44 million of the standby letters of credit are backed by our credit facilities, reducing the borrowing capacity under the credit facilities. Refer to footnote 9 of the financial statements for further details of our debt obligations. We also maintain in excess of $400 million of surety bonds related primarily to our self insured insurance costs. These bonds are required by most states in which we are self insured for workers compensation and general liability exposures, and are made with third party insurance providers to insure payment of our insurance obligations in the event we are unable to make those payments. These bonds do not represent liabilities of Kroger, as we already have liabilities on our books for the insurance costs. However, we do pay annual maintenance fees to 17 have these bonds in place. Market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and, in some instances, availability of these bonds may become more limited, which could affect our costs of or access to such bonds. Although we do not believe such increased costs or decreased availability significantly would impact our ability to access these surety bonds, if this does become an issue, we likely would issue letters of credit against our credit facilities to meet the state bonding requirements. This could both increase our costs and decrease the funds available to us under our credit facilities. Most of our outstanding public debt is jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed by The Kroger Co. and certain of its subsidiaries. See footnote 22 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of those arrangements. In addition, we have guaranteed half of the indebtedness of two real estate joint ventures in which we are a partner with 50% ownership. Our share of the responsibility for this indebtednesss, should these partnerships be unable to meet their obligations, totals approximately $8 million. Based on the covenants underlying this indebtedness as of February 2, 2002, it is unlikely that we will be responsible for repayment of these obligations. We also are a party to a financing transaction related to 34 properties which were constructed for total costs of approximately $393 million. Under the terms of the financing transaction, which was structured as a synthetic lease, a special purpose trust owns the properties and leases them to subsidiaries of Kroger. The lease has a term of five years, which expires in February 2003. We pay a variable lease rate of approximately 3.3% at February 2, 2002. The synthetic lease qualifies as an operating lease and the owner of the special purpose trust has made a substantive residual equity investment. The transaction, therefore, is accounted for off balance sheet and the related costs are reported as rent expense. As of February 2, 2002, the assets and liabilities of the special purpose trust primarily were comprised of the properties and $379 million of bank debt used to fund the construction of the properties. In connection with these financing transactions, we have made a residual value guarantee for the leased property equal to 85% of the financing, or $335 million. We believe the market values of the property subject to this financing exceeded the residual value guarantee at year end 2001. We intend to reduce the synthetic lease facility by approximately $200 million in the first quarter 2002. 18 Commodity Price Protection We enter into purchase commitments for various resources, including raw materials utilized in our manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in our stores, manufacturing facilities and administrative offices. We enter into such commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of normal business. Those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in the normal course of business qualify as normal purchases and normal sales. For any commitments in which we do not expect to take delivery and, as a result, will require net settlement, the contracts are marked to fair value on a quarterly basis. As more fully described below in Recently Issued Accounting Standards, we recorded a pre tax loss of $81 million in the third quarter 2001 to accrue liabilities for the estimated fair values of energy contracts that no longer qualified for the normal purchases and normal sales exception. As of February 2, 2002, these liabilities totaled $78 million. IMPACT OF INFLATION While management believes that some portion of the increase in sales is due to inflation, it is difficult to segregate and to measure the effects of inflation because of changes in the types of merchandise sold year to year and other pricing and competitive influences. We believe there was overall inflation in retail prices. We experienced deflation in our costs of product of some commodities due to managements success in obtaining synergies and the economies of scale resulting from recent mergers. In other commodities such as pharmacy and general merchandise, our costs of product increased. By attempting to control costs and efficiently utilize resources, we strive to minimize the effects of inflation on operations. OTHER ISSUES On January 6, 1999, we changed our fiscal year end to the Saturday nearest January 31 of each year. This change is disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8 K dated January 6, 1999. We filed separate audited financial 19 statements covering the transition period from January 3, 1999, to January 30, 1999, on a Current Report on Form 8 K dated May 10, 1999. These financial statements included Kroger and its consolidated subsidiaries before the merger with Fred Meyer. During the transition period we had sales of $2,160 million, costs and expenses of $2,135 million, and net earnings of $25 million. We indirectly own a 50% interest in the entity that owns the Santee Dairy in Los Angeles, California, and have a product supply agreement with Santee that requires us to purchase 9 million gallons of fluid milk and other products annually. The product supply agreement expires on July 29, 2007. Upon acquisition of Ralphs/Food 4 Less, Santee became excess capacity and a duplicate facility. The joint venture is managed independently and has a board comprised of an equal number of members from each partner, plus one independent member. When there is a split vote, this member generally votes with the other partner. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133, and SFAS No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, became effective for Kroger as of February 4, 2001. SFAS No. 133, as amended, defines derivatives, requires that derivatives be carried at fair value on the balance sheet, and provides for hedge accounting when certain conditions are met. Initial adoption of this new accounting standard resulted in Kroger recording a liability of $9 million, with a corresponding charge recorded as other comprehensive loss, net of income tax effects. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, derivative financial instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent the hedges are highly effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income, net of related tax effects. The ineffective portion of the cash flow hedge, if any, is recognized in current period earnings. Other comprehensive income is reclassified to current period earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, along with the corresponding changes in the fair values of the hedged assets or liabilities, are recorded in current period earnings. We assess, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether derivatives used as hedging instruments are highly effective in offsetting the changes in the fair value or cash flow of hedged items. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or ceases to be highly effective, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. As of February 2, 2002, we maintain four interest rate swaps and one interest rate collar designated as cash flow hedges of variable rate debt. A liability totaling $11 million has been recorded for these instruments. We also have recorded a liability of $42 million related to a cash flow hedge of electricity purchases, as more fully described below. Hedge ineffectiveness was not material for these instruments during 2001. Corresponding charges were recorded as other comprehensive loss, net of income tax effects. In addition, we maintain five interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of fixed rate debt. As of February 2, 2002, a liability totaling $18 million has been recorded to reflect the fair value of these swaps, offset by an asset for the same amount to reflect the impact of the change in interest rates on the fair value of the debt. During March through May 2001, Kroger entered into four separate commitments to purchase electricity from one of our utility suppliers in southern California. At the inception of these contracts, forecasted electricity usage, which was estimated primarily based on historical energy usage, indicated that it was probable that all of the electricity would be utilized in our operations. We, therefore, accounted for the contracts in accordance with the 20 normal purchases and normal sales exception under SFAS No. 133, as amended, and no amounts were recorded in the financial statements related to these purchase commitments. During the third quarter 2001, we reassessed our projected electricity requirements in southern California. Due primarily to energy conservation programs initiated by Kroger in the latter half of 2001, we determined that we no longer needed all of the electricity that we had committed to purchase. As a result one of the contracts and a portion of a second contract were deemed to exceed expected electricity usage, thereby eliminating the normal purchases and normal sales exception under SFAS No. 133 for those contracts, and requiring the fair value of the contracts to be recorded currently in earnings. These contracts will continue to be marked to market through current earnings each quarter. Accordingly, we recorded a pre tax third quarter charge of $81 million to accrue liabilities for the estimated fair value of these contracts through December 2006. These liabilities totaled $78 million as of February 2, 2002. The remaining portion of the second contract has been re designated as a cash flow hedge of future purchases. The other two purchase commitments continue to qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception under SFAS No. 133. A tabular summary of our interest rate swaps and energy purchase commitments that are included in the financial statements is included in footnote 20 to the consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, were issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in late June of 2001. SFAS No. 141 is effective for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and SFAS No. 142 became effective for Kroger on February 3, 2002. Goodwill no longer will be amortized and instead will be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis. We estimate that non amortization of goodwill will improve fiscal 2002 net earnings by approximately $96 million. Kroger currently is performing its initial goodwill impairment review at the operating division level to determine the effect the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements. SFAS No. 143, Asset Retirement Obligations, was issued by the FASB in August of 2001. SFAS No. 143 became effective for Kroger on February 2, 2003. We currently are analyzing the effect this standard will have on our financial statements. SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, was issued by the FASB in August of 2001. SFAS No. 144 became effective for Kroger on February 3, 2002. We expect the adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on our financial statements. Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue Nos. 00 22, Accounting for Points and Certain Other Time Based or Volume Based Sales and Incentive Offers, and Offers for Free Products or Services to be Delivered in the Future, and 01 09, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendors Products), became effective for Kroger beginning in the first quarter of 2002. These issues address the appropriate accounting for certain vendor contracts and loyalty programs. We continue to assess the effect these new standards will have on the financial statements. We expect the adoption of these standards will not have a material effect on our financial statements. OUTLOOK This analysis contains certain forward looking statements about Krogers future performance. These statements are based on managements assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available. Such statements relate to, among other things: projected growth in earnings per share (EPS); working capital reduction; a decline in our net total debt to EBITDA ratio; our ability to generate free cash flow; and our strategic growth plan, and are indicated by words or phrases such as comfortable, committed, expects, goal, and similar words or phrases. These forward looking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Our ability to achieve annual EPS growth goals will be affected primarily by pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors, including non traditional food retailers, our responses to these actions intended to increase market share, and the success of our Strategic Growth Plan announced in December 2001. In addition, Krogers EPS growth goals could be affected by: increases in product costs; newly opened or consolidated distribution centers; our ability to obtain sales growth from new square footage; competitive activity in the markets in which we operate; changes in our product mix; and changes in laws and regulations. Our ability to reduce our net total debt to EBITDA ratio could be adversely affected by: our ability to generate sales growth and free cash flow; interest rate fluctuations and other changes in capital market conditions; Krogers stock repurchase activity; unexpected increases in the cost of capital expenditures; acquisitions; and other factors. The results of our Strategic Growth Plan and our ability to generate free cash flow to the extent expected could be adversely affected if any of the factors identified above negatively impact our operations. In addition, the timing of the execution of the plan could adversely impact our EPS and sales results. Statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations, projections, beliefs, intentions or strategies are forward looking statements within 21 the meaning of Section 21 E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. While we believe that the statements are accurate, uncertainties about the general economy, our labor relations, our ability to execute our plans on a timely basis and other uncertainties described below could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements. Our forward looking statements are based on the following assumptions, among others, and if these assumptions prove to be incorrect, our actual results may be adversely affected: We expect to reduce net operating working capital as compared to the third quarter of 1999 by $500 million by the end of the third quarter 2004. We define net operating working capital as current operating assets, before LIFO credit, less current operating liabilities. We do not intend the presentation of net operating working capital to be an alternative to any generally accepted accounting principle measure of performance. Rather we believe this presentation is relevant to an assessment of our operating financial performance for working capital. As of the end of fiscal 2001, net operating working capital has increased $143 million, compared to the fourth quarter of 2000, but decreased $175 million compared to the fourth quarter of 1999. A calculation of net operating working capital based on our definition as of the fourth quarter 2001, the fourth quarter 2000 and the fourth quarter of 1999 is provided in the following table: Fourth Quarter 2001  Fourth Quarter 2000  Fourth Quarter 1999  (In millions) Cash $ 161 $ 161 $ 281 Receivables 679 687 635 FIFO inventory 4,518 4,382 4,260 Operating prepaid and other assets 488 410 495 Accounts payable (3,005 ) (3,009 ) (2,804 ) Operating accrued liabilities (1,923 ) (1,918 ) (1,844 ) Prepaid VEBA (270 ) (208 ) (200 ) Net working capital $ 648 $ 505 $ 823 We obtain sales growth from new square footage, as well as from increased productivity from existing locations. During the next two years, Kroger plans to increase square footage by 3.5% 4.5% year over year. We expect combination stores to increase our sales per customer by including numerous specialty departments, such as pharmacies, natural food products, seafood shops, floral shops, bakeries and fuel centers. We believe the combination store format will allow us to withstand continued competition from other food retailers, supercenters, mass merchandisers, club or warehouse stores, drug stores and restaurants. On December 11, 2001, Kroger outlined a Strategic Growth Plan that will support additional investment in core business to grow sales and increase market share. We intend to achieve identical supermarket store sales growth of 2% to 3% above product cost inflation and to reduce merchandising and operating, general and administrative costs by more than $500 million over the next two years. We expect approximately two thirds of this reduction will be achieved by the end of fiscal 2002. As part of the plan to reduce operating, general and administrative costs, we have identified approximately 1,500 positions to be eliminated and have merged one division into two adjacent marketing areas. As part of the plan, we have established a long term, sustainable annual earnings per share (EPS) growth target of 13% 15%, before one time items, beginning in fiscal 2004. For fiscal 2002 and 2003, we expect annual EPS growth of 10% 12%, before one time items. We also estimate that adoption of SFAS No. 142 will improve fiscal 2002 net earnings by approximately $96 million beyond the expected growth rate of 10% 12%. Kroger estimates free cash flow to be approximately $550 $650 million in fiscal 2002. The estimate reflects capital spending of $2.1 billion, which is consistent with prior plans, and a net working capital reduction of $100 million. 22 We believe the total cost of the Strategic Growth Plan will be approximately $75 million to $90 million pre tax, a reduction of $10 million from our original estimate in December 2001. In the fourth quarter 2001, we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of $37 million primarily for severance agreements associated with this plan. Most of this severance will be paid in 2002. Capital expenditures reflect our strategy of growth through expansion and acquisition as well as our emphasis on self development and ownership of store real estate, and on logistics and technology improvements. The continued capital spending in technology focusing on improved store operations, logistics, manufacturing procurement, category management, merchandising and buying practices, should reduce merchandising costs and operating, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales. We expect our capital expenditures for fiscal 2002 to total $2.1 billion, excluding acquisitions. We intend to use the combination of free cash flows from operations, including reductions in working capital, and borrowings under credit facilities to finance capital expenditure requirements. If determined preferable, we may fund capital expenditure requirements by mortgaging facilities, entering into sale/leaseback transactions, or by issuing additional debt or equity. Based on current operating results, we believe that operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity, including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facilities, will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, interest payments and scheduled principal payments for the foreseeable future. We also believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to respond effectively to competitive conditions. We have identified the following uncertainties about the future that could have an adverse effect on our actual results: A decline in the generation of sufficient cash flows to support capital expansion plans, share repurchase programs and general operating activities could cause our growth to slow significantly and may cause us to miss our earnings targets, because we obtain some of our sales growth from new square footage. The grocery retailing industry continues to experience fierce competition from other grocery retailers, supercenters, club or warehouse stores, mass merchandise stores, and drug stores. Our ability to maintain our current success is dependent upon our ability to compete in this industry and continue to reduce operating expenses. The competitive environment may cause us to reduce our prices in order to gain or maintain share 23 of sales, thus reducing margins. While we believe our opportunities for sustained, profitable growth are considerable, unanticipated actions of competitors could impact our share of sales and net income. Changes in laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, and environmental laws may have a material impact on our financial statements. Changes in the general business and economic conditions in our operating regions, including the rate of inflation, population growth, and employment and job growth in the markets in which we operate may affect our ability to hire and train qualified employees to operate our stores. This would negatively affect earnings and sales growth. General economic changes may also effect the shopping habits of our customers, which could affect sales and earnings. Changes in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial indicators. For example, we have added and will continue to add supermarket fuel centers. Since gasoline is a low profit margin item with high sales dollars, we expect to see our gross profit margins decrease as we sell more gasoline. Although this negatively affects our gross profit margin, gasoline is expected to provide a positive effect on EBITDA and net earnings. We are party to 346 collective bargaining agreements with local unions representing approximately 205,000 employees. During 2001 we negotiated 96 labor contracts without any material work stoppages. Typical agreements are three to five years in duration and, as agreements expire, we expect to enter new collective bargaining agreements. In 2002, 83 collective bargaining agreements will expire, including the Southern California Teamsters and Dallas store employees. We also have significant agreements expiring that cover store employees in northeast Indiana, Arkansas, Oregon and North Carolina. We cannot be certain that agreements will be reached without work stoppage. A prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of stores could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations. Our ability to integrate any companies we acquire or have acquired and achieve operating improvements at those companies will affect our operations. We retain a portion of the exposure for our workers compensation and general liability claims. It is possible that these claims may cause significant expenditures that would affect the operating cash flows of the company. Our capital expenditures could fall outside of the expected range if we are unsuccessful in acquiring suitable sites for new stores, if development costs exceed those budgeted, or if our logistics and technology projects are not completed in the time frame expected or on budget. Adverse weather conditions could increase the costs that our suppliers charge for our products, or may decrease the customer demand for certain products. Additionally, increases in the costs of inputs, such as utility costs or raw material costs, could negatively impact financial ratios and net earnings. Although we currently operate only in the United States, civil unrest in foreign countries in which our suppliers do business may affect the prices we are charged for imported goods. If we are unable to pass these increases on to our customers, our gross margin and EBITDA will suffer. Interest rate fluctuation and other capital market conditions may cause variability in earnings. Although we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to financial risks, we are still exposed to interest rate fluctuations and other capital market conditions. We cannot fully foresee the effects of the general economic downturn upon Krogers business. We have assumed the economic situation and competitive situations will not change significantly for 2002 and 2003. Other factors and assumptions not identified above could also cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking information. Accordingly, actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in or contemplated or implied by forward looking statements made by us or our representatives. 24 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Risk Management We use derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. As a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure. Because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure, fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure. The interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets. We limit our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of variable and fixed rate debt, and interest rate swaps. Our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates both fixing the rates on variable rate debt and hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. To do this, we use the following guidelines: (i) use average daily bank balance to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure, (ii) limit the annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of $2.3 billion or less, (iii) include no leveraged products, and (iv) hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current mark to market status. 25 During the third quarter 2001, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates. Maturity dates of interest rate swap arrangements match those of the underlying debt. These agreements, which mature from 2003 to 2008, involve the exchange of fixed rate payments for variable rate payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts. Variable rates for our agreements are based on three month U.S. dollar LIBOR and are reset on a quarterly basis. The differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements and is recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense. The notional principal amounts of these interest rate swap arrangements were approximately $1.2 billion at February 2, 2002. These agreements are accounted for as fair value hedges. Also during the third quarter of 2001, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to cash flows resulting from potential increases in interest rates by effectively converting a portion of our debt from variable to fixed rates. These agreements, which mature in 2003 and 2004, involve the exchange of variable rate payments for fixed rate payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts. Variable rates for our agreements are based on three month U.S. dollar LIBOR and are reset on a quarterly basis. The differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements and is recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense. The notional principal amounts of these interest rate swap arrangements were approximately $923 million at February 2, 2002. These agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges. Annually, we review with the Financial Policy Committee of our Board of Directors compliance with the guidelines. In addition, our internal auditors review compliance with these guidelines on at least an annual basis. The guidelines may change as our business needs dictate. The table below provides information about our interest rate derivatives and underlying debt portfolio. The amount shown for each year represents the contractual maturities of long term debt, excluding capital leases, and the outstanding notional amount of interest rate derivatives. Interest rates reflect the weighted average for the outstanding instruments. The variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on LIBOR using the forward yield curve as of February 2, 2002. The Fair Value column includes the fair value of those debt instruments for which it is reasonably possible to calculate a fair value and the fair value of our interest rate derivatives as of February 2, 2002.
