ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion summarizes our operating results for 2002 compared to 2001 and 2001 compared to 2000. However, 2002 results are not directly comparable to 2001 results and 2001 results are not directly comparable to 2000 results due to a 53 week year in 2000 and the effects of acquisitions in all years presented. Sales Total sales were $51.8 billion, $50.1 billion and $49.0 billion, for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. These sales represented annual increases of 3.3% in 2002 and 2.2% in 2001. Excluding $919 million of sales to adjust for the estimated effect of a 53rd week of sales in 2000, the annual increase in 2001 would have been 4.2%. Total food store sales were $49.3 billion, $47.7 billion, and $46.5 billion, for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Fiscal 2000 results include approximately $877 million of sales from a 53rd week in 2000. The differences between total sales and total food store sales primarily related to sales at our convenience store and jewelry store divisions, as well as to sales by our manufacturing plants to outside firms. We define a food store as an identical store in the quarter after the store has been in operation and has not been expanded or relocated for four full quarters. Identical food store sales, as used to calculate each respective years percent change in identical food store sales, were $46.0 billion and $44.3 billion for 2002 and 2001, respectively. Identical food store sales were flat in 2002 compared to 2001 and increased 0.9% in 2001 over 2000. We define a food store as a comparable store in the quarter after the store has been in operation for four full quarters including expansions and relocations. Comparable food store sales, as used to calculate each respective years percent change in comparable food store sales, were $47.4 billion and $45.7 billion for 2002 and 2001, respectively. Comparable food store sales increased 0.8% in 2002 over 2001 and increased 1.5% in 2001 over 2000. Identical and comparable food store sales exclude the estimated effect of a 53rd week of sales in 2000. The differences between total food store sales, adjusted for the 53rd week in 2000, and identical food store sales were primarily due to the increases in food store square footage as discussed below in Capital Expenditures. The increase in the percent of total sales attributable to sales at supermarket fuel centers has significantly impacted our results. At the end of 2002, we operated 376 supermarket fuel centers compared to 227 and 77 supermarket fuel centers at the end of 2001 and 2000, respectively. Excluding sales at supermarket fuel centers, identical food store sales decreased 0.7% in 2002 compared to 2001 and increased 0.4% in 2001 over 2000. On the same basis, comparable food store sales were flat in 2002 compared to 2001 and increased 0.9% in 2001 over 2000. Our sales in 2002 were also affected by deflation in various commodity groups, the weak economy, war fears, increased competition and the results of our Strategic Growth Plan (Plan). The estimated impact of inflation and deflation is described below in Impact of Inflation. We believe the effects of the weak economy and increased competition partially offset the benefits from Krogers price reductions associated with the Plan in 2002. Gross Profit Our gross profit rates were 26.95%, 27.35% and 26.93% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. We recorded a Last In, First Out (LIFO) credit of $50 million in 2002 compared to a LIFO charge of $23 million in 2001 and a LIFO credit of $6 million in 2000. Excluding these LIFO credits and charges, our gross profit rates were 26.85%, 27.39% and 26.92% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. These rates reflect our investment in lower retail prices as part of the Plan in 2002. The effect of our investment in the Plan was partially offset by decreases in product costs due to consolidated purchasing activities. The increase in our gross profit rate in 2001 versus 2000 partially resulted from similar decreases in product costs. Improved private label sales and manufacturing plant results also increased our gross profit rates in both 2002 and 2001. The increase in the percent of total sales from supermarket fuel centers in 2002 versus 2001 reduced the gross profit rate by approximately 17 basis points in 2002 versus 2001 and by approximately 15 basis points in 2001 versus 2000. Supermarket fuel center sales have a negative impact on our overall gross profit rate due to the relatively low gross profit rate on fuel sales. Some significant items recorded as merchandise costs in 2002, 2001 and 2000, further affected our gross profit rates. These items are described below in Significant Items. Operating, General and Administrative Expenses Operating, general and administrative (OG&A) expenses, which consist primarily of employee related costs such as wages, health care benefit costs and retirement plan costs, as a percent of sales were 18.58%, 18.93% and 18.68% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in the percent of total sales from supermarket fuel centers in 2002 versus 2001 reduced our overall OG&A expense rate by approximately 11 points in 2002 versus 2001 and by approximately 10 basis points in 2001 versus 2000. Supermarket fuel center sales have a positive impact on our overall OG&A expense rate due to the relatively low overhead costs associated with fuel sales. A portion of the decrease in our OG&A expense rate in 2002 versus 2001 was due to the successful cost reduction and productivity initiatives associated with the Strategic Growth Plan that we announced in December 2001. Our OG&A rates declined in 2002 despite increases in our health care benefit costs, pension costs and credit card fees. Health care benefits costs, pension costs and credit card fees, as a percent of sales, increased approximately 15 basis points, nine basis points and five basis points, respectively, in 2002 versus 2001. The increase in our OG&A rate in 2001 versus 2000 was also due to higher health care benefit costs and credit card fees. Additionally, utility costs increased as a percent of sales in 2001 versus 2000. Some significant items recorded as operating, general and administrative expense in 2002, 2001 and 2000 further affected our rates. These items are described below in Significant Items. Rent Expense Rent expense, as a percent of sales, was 1.27%, 1.30% and 1.32% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The decreases in these rates reflect the emphasis our current growth strategy places on ownership of real estate. Depreciation Expense Depreciation expense totaled $1,087 million, $973 million and $907 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increases in depreciation expense primarily were due to Krogers capital investment program and the emphasis on ownership of real estate. Goodwill Amortization In 2001 and 2000, goodwill amortization expense totaled $103 million and $101 million, respectively. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, which became effective for Kroger on February 3, 2002, goodwill was not amortized in 2002. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies for a discussion of Krogers annual evaluation of the carrying amount of goodwill. Interest Expense Net interest expense totaled $600 million, $648 million and $675 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. These decreases resulted from lower interest rates on our floating rate debt in 2002 versus 2001 and in 2001 versus 2000. Net interest expense also decreased in 2002 due to an overall reduction of outstanding debt in 2002 versus 2001. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 37.5%, 39.1% and 41.6% in 2002, 2001 and 2000. The effective income tax rates differ from the expected statutory rate primarily because of the effect of state taxes. The effective rate for 2002 also differs from the effective rate for 2001 and 2000 due to the elimination of the amortization of goodwill in 2002. The effective rate for 2000 was also affected by the write off of non deductible goodwill in 2000. Net Earnings Net earnings totaled $1.2 billion, or $1.52 per diluted share, in 2002. These results represent an increase of approximately 20.6% over net earnings of $1.26 per diluted share for 2001. As described above, goodwill amortization expense totaled $103 million, pre tax, in 2001, but goodwill was not amortized in 2002. Adjusting 2001 results to eliminate the amortization of goodwill and its tax effect, as illustrated in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, net earnings would have been $1.37 per diluted share, in 2001. On this basis, net earnings of $1.52 per diluted share for 2002 represent an increase of approximately 10.9% over net earnings of $1.37 per diluted share for 2001. Net earnings of $1.26 per diluted share for 2001 represent an increase of approximately 21.2% over net earnings of $1.04 per diluted share for 2000. Adjusting results in both years to eliminate the amortization of goodwill and its tax effect, as illustrated in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, net earnings would have been $1.37 per diluted share in 2001, an increase of 19.1% over net earnings of $1.15 per diluted share in 2000. SIGNIFICANT ITEMS The following table summarizes items that significantly affected Krogers financial results during 2002, 2001 and 2000. These items include asset impairment charges, restructuring charges, merger related costs and the cumulative effect of an accounting change, all of which are shown separately in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The items also include other charges and credits that were recorded as components of merchandise costs and operating, general and administrative expense. The items totaled $87 million, $174 million and $250 million of net, after tax expense in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 2002 2001 2000 (In millions except per share amounts) Significant items in merchandise costs Costs related to mergers $ 2 $ 12 $ 37 Item cost conversion 91 Adoption of EITF Issue No. 02 16 28 Adoption of EITF Issue No. 02 16 LIFO effect (28 ) Total in merchandise costs 93 12 37 Significant items in operating, general and administrative expense Costs related to mergers 22 37 41 Lease liabilities store closing plans 20 67 Excess energy purchase commitments (19 ) 83 Total in operating, general and administrative expense 3 140 108 Asset impairment charges 91 191 Restructuring charges 15 37 Merger related costs 1 4 15 Total pre tax effect of significant items 112 284 351 Income tax benefit (1) (41 ) (110 ) (101 ) After tax effect of significant items 71 174 250 Cumulative effect of an accounting change, net of tax 16 Total after tax expense $ 87 $ 174 $ 250 Diluted shares 791 825 846 Approximate diluted per share effect $ 0.11 $ 0.21 $ 0.30 (1) Income tax benefits are affected by the non deductibility of certain items. Significant Items In Merchandise Costs and In Operating, General and Administrative Expense Costs related to mergers Costs related to mergers included expenses recognized as a consequence of the continued integration of the Companys divisions. Integration primarily resulted from the Companys merger with Fred Meyer. These expenses primarily related to severance agreements, enterprise system and banner conversions, and inventory write downs. Item cost conversion In 1998, prior to the merger with Fred Meyer, we changed our application of the LIFO method of accounting for certain store inventories from the retail method to the item cost method. The change improved the accuracy of product cost calculations by eliminating the averaging and estimation inherent in the retail method. During the fourth quarter of 2002, we adopted the item cost method for the former Fred Meyer divisions. The cumulative effect of this change on periods prior to February 3, 2002, cannot be determined. The effect of the change on the February 3, 2002 inventory valuation, which includes other immaterial modifications in inventory valuation methods, was included in restated results for the quarter ended May 25, 2002. This change increased merchandise costs by $91 million and reduced net earnings by $57 million. We did not calculate the pro forma effect on prior periods because cost information for these periods was not determinable. The item cost method did not have a material effect on earnings subsequent to its adoption on February 3, 2002. Adoption of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 02 16 As described below in Recently Issued Accounting Standards, we adopted EITF Issue No. 02 16 during the fourth quarter of 2002. This issue addresses the method by which retailers account for vendor allowances. As a result, we recorded a pre tax charge of $28 million. This expense was offset by a corresponding pre tax LIFO credit of $28 million. Lease liabilities store closing plans In 2001 and 2000, we recorded pre tax expenses of $20 million and $67 million, respectively, for the present value of lease liabilities related to store closings. Sales at stores considered in these charges totaled $186 million, $236 million and $377 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Net operating income or loss from these stores cannot be determined on a separately identifiable basis. These liabilities were the result of two distinct, formalized plans that coordinated the closings of several locations over relatively short periods of time. The liabilities pertained primarily to stores acquired in the Fred Meyer merger, or to stores operated prior to the merger that were in close proximity to stores acquired in the merger, that were identified as under performing stores. Therefore, liabilities were recorded for the anticipated closings of the stores. Due to the on going consolidation in our industry, certain stores remained open to determine if performance could be improved. Final determination regarding these stores will be made in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details of these liabilities. Excess energy purchase commitments During the third quarter of 2001, we recorded a pre tax charge of $81 million to accrue liabilities for the estimated fair value of energy purchase commitments that provided for supplies in excess of our expected demand for electricity. SFAS No. 133 requires the excess commitments to be marked to fair value through current period earnings each quarter. In 2002, we recorded net pre tax income of $19 million as a result of the market value adjustments of these excess commitments. Market value adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2001 resulted in a pre tax charge of $2 million. Refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and to our discussion of commodity price protection below in Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional details of these liabilities. Asset Impairment Charges During 2001 and 2000, we recorded pre tax impairment charges of $91 million and $191 million, respectively. In 2000, we performed an impairment review due to new divisional leadership and updated profitability forecasts for 2000 and beyond. In 2001, we performed an impairment review due to recent investments by acquired companies in stores that did not perform as expected and updated profitability forecasts for 2002 and beyond. In both years, we identified impairment losses for assets to be disposed of and for assets to be held and used. In 2000, we also identified impairment losses for investments in former suppliers that have experienced financial difficulty and with whom supply arrangements have ceased. The 2001 charge related to locations that either had not opened, or had only recently opened, when the 2000 impairment charge was performed. As a result, estimates of future operating performance for these locations were not determined at that time. No asset impairment charges were recorded in 2002. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details of these charges. Restructuring Charges On December 11, 2001, we outlined our Strategic Growth Plan to support additional investment in core business to increase sales and market share. In the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of $37 million primarily for severance agreements associated with the Plan. Restructuring charges related to the Plan totaled $15 million, pre tax, in 2002. The majority of the 2002 expenses related to severance agreements and distribution center consolidation and conversion costs. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details of these charges. Merger Related Costs During 2002, 2001 and 2000, we recorded net, pre tax expenses of $1 million, $4 million and $10 million, respectively, from the issuance of restricted stock and the related market value adjustments. The restrictions on these stock awards lapsed in 2002 based on the achievement of synergy goals established in connection with the Fred Meyer merger. Our merger related costs in 2000 also included $5 million of severance expense. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details of these charges. Cumulative Effect of an Accounting Change As noted above in Results of Operations, we adopted SFAS No. 142 on February 3, 2002. The transitional impairment review required by SFAS No. 142 resulted in a $26 million pre tax non cash loss to write off the jewelry store division goodwill based on its implied fair value. Impairment primarily resulted from the recent operating performance of the division and review of the divisions projected future cash flows on a discounted basis, rather than on an undiscounted basis, as was the standard under SFAS No. 121, prior to adoption of SFAS No. 142. This loss was recorded as a cumulative effect of an accounting change, net of a $10 million tax benefit, in the first quarter of 2002. For further details of this charge, refer to our discussion of SFAS No. 142 in Recently Issued Accounting Standards. COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM In December of 1999, we began a program to repurchase common stock to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans. This program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises, including the tax benefit. In January of 2000, the Board of Directors (Board) authorized an additional repurchase of up to $100 million of common stock. On March 31, 2000, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $750 million of Kroger common stock. This repurchase program replaced the $100 million program authorized in January of 2000. During fiscal 2000, we made open market purchases of approximately $43 million under the stock option program and $539 million under the $750 million program. On March 1, 2001, the Board authorized the repurchase of an incremental $1 billion of Kroger common stock. This repurchase program was in addition to the $750 million stock buyback authorized in 2000. During fiscal 2001, we made open market purchases of approximately $180 million under the stock option program and $209 million to complete the $750 million program. We also made open market purchases of $343 million under the $1 billion authorization. During fiscal 2002, we made open market purchases of approximately $657 million to complete the $1 billion program. Effective December 10, 2002, the Board authorized a new stock repurchase program totaling $500 million. We made open market purchases of $63 million under this plan in 2002. We also reacquired approximately $71 million under the stock option program in fiscal 2002. Purchases of stock under the Board approved repurchase programs are made when the expected return exceeds our cost of capital. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Capital expenditures excluding acquisitions totaled $1.9 billion in 2002 compared to $1.9 billion in 2001 and $1.6 billion in 2000. Most amounts were used to construct new stores. Capital expenditures in 2002 included $192 million related to the purchase of assets previously financed under a synthetic lease. The table below shows our supermarket storing activity and our total food store square footage: 2002 2001 2000 Beginning of year 2,418 2,354 2,288 Opened 62 59 59 Opened (relocation) 17 26 22 Acquired 37 34 45 Acquired (relocation) 8 1 1 Closed (operational) (29 ) (29 ) (38 ) Closed (relocation) (25 ) (27 ) (23 ) End of year 2,488 2,418 2,354 Total food store square footage (in millions) 136 130 124 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position, and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner. The significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Self Insurance Costs We primarily are self insured for costs related to workers compensation and general liability claims. Liabilities are actuarially determined and are recognized based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. The liabilities for workers compensation claims are accounted for on a present value basis. We have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis. We are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits. The assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability, which can affect the liability recorded for such claims. For example, variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized. Similarly, changes in legal trends and interpretations, as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can impact ultimate costs. Although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables, any changes could have a considerable effect upon future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities. Impairments of Long Lived Assets We monitor the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether trigger events have occurred. These events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset. When a trigger event occurs, an impairment calculation is performed, comparing projected undiscounted cash flows, utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores, to the carrying value for those stores. If impairment is identified for long lived assets to be held and used, we compare discounted future cash flows to the assets current carrying value. We record impairment when the carrying value exceeds the discounted cash flows. With respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal, the value of the property and equipment is adjusted to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions. Impairment is recognized for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value, reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal. Any reductions in the carrying value of assets resulting from the application of this policy are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as Asset impairment charges. Goodwill We adopted SFAS No. 142 on February 3, 2002. Accordingly, goodwill is reviewed for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, and also upon the occurrence of trigger events. The reviews are performed at the operating division level. Generally, fair value represents a multiple of earnings, or discounted projected future cash flows, and is compared to the carrying value of a division for purposes of identifying potential impairment. If potential for impairment is identified, the fair value of a division is measured against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities, excluding goodwill, to estimate an implied fair value of the divisions goodwill. Goodwill impairment is recognized for any excess of the carrying value of the divisions goodwill over the implied fair value. For details of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during 2002, refer to our discussion of SFAS No. 142 in Recently Issued Accounting Standards. The annual impairment review requires the extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates. Application of alternative assumptions and definitions, such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different organizational level, could produce significantly different results. Store Closing Costs We provide for closed store liabilities relating to the present value of the estimated remaining noncancellable lease payments after the anticipated closing date, net of estimated subtenant income. We estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores. The closed store lease liabilities usually are paid over the lease terms associated with the closed stores, which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to 20 years. For owned stores that we intend to sell, we actively market the stores to potential buyers. Owned stores held for disposal are reduced to their estimated net realizable value. The value of any equipment and leasehold improvements related to a closed store is reduced to reflect estimated recoverable values. We estimate subtenant income, future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located, our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions. However, the ultimate cost of the disposition of these leases and related assets is affected by current real estate markets, inflation rates, and general economic conditions. Store closings generally are completed within one year after the decision to close. Adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant and actual exit costs differing from original estimates. Adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known. Any excess store closing liability remaining upon settlement of the obligation is reversed to income in the period that the settlement is determined. Other costs related to individual operational store closings initiated by local divisional management, including costs to reduce the carrying value of property and equipment, are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as Operating, general and administrative costs. Reductions in the carrying value of property and equipment related to stores closed in connection with a corporate level strategic plan are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as Asset impairment charges in accordance with our policy on impairments of long lived assets. Inventory write downs, if any, in connection with store closings, are classified in Merchandise costs. Costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores are expensed as incurred. Store closing liabilities are reviewed quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs, or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose, is adjusted to income in the proper period. As noted below in Recently Issued Accounting Standards, SFAS No. 146 became effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. All closed store liabilities related to exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002, have been and will continue to be accounted for accordingly. Purchase Commitments Occasionally, we enter into purchase commitments for various resources, including raw materials utilized in our manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in our stores, manufacturing facilities and administrative offices. Upon entering into these commitments, and on a quarterly basis thereafter, we evaluate our expectation to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of our normal course of business. Those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in our normal course of business qualify as normal purchases and normal sales. For any commitments for which we do not expect to utilize or take delivery and, as a result, will require net settlement, the contracts are marked to fair value on a quarterly basis. Benefit Plans The determination of our obligation and expense for pension and other post retirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts. Those assumptions are described in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and include, among others, the discount rate, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rates of increase in compensation and health care costs. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other post retirement obligations and our future expense. Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements discusses the impact of a 1% change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other post retirement benefit costs and the related liability. The discount rate was lowered to 6.75% as of February 1, 2003, from 7.25% as of February 2, 2002. The 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate increased the pension projected benefit obligation as of February 1, 2003, by $104.3 million. In 2003, we expect that the annual pension expense will increase by $4.7 million as a result of this change. We also reduced the compensation increase assumption to 3.50% as of February 1, 2003, from 3.75% as of February 2, 2002. The 25 basis point reduction in the compensation increase assumption reduced the pension projected benefit obligation as of February 1, 2003, by $11.9 million. In 2003, we expect that the annual pension expense will decrease by $1.6 million as a result of this change. We intend to reduce the pension return assumption of 9.50% for 2002 to 8.50% for 2003. Our pension plans average annual return for the 10 fiscal years ending February 1, 2003, was 10.00%, net of all fees and expenses. We believe the reduction in the pension return assumption is appropriate because we do not expect that future returns will achieve the same level of performance as the historical average annual return. Beginning in fiscal 2003, we expect that the annual pension expense will increase by $14.0 million as a result of the reduction in expected return from 9.50% to 8.50%. In addition, we are adding an assumption for non asset related expenses paid out of the trust. This assumption will add $4.0 million to the annual pension expense. On February 18, 2003, we made a cash contribution of $100 million to our pension plans. Approximately 50% of this contribution was required minimum funding for 2002 that was not required to be funded until September of 2003. The remaining 50% of the contribution was discretionary. We also participate in various multi employer plans for substantially all union employees. We are required to make contributions to these plans in amounts established under collective bargaining agreements. Pension expense for these plans is recognized as contributions are funded. Benefits are generally based upon a fixed amount for each year of service. A decline in the value of assets held by these plans, caused by performance of the investments in the financial markets in recent years, is likely to result in higher contributions to these plans and to create challenges in our collective bargaining. Moreover, if we exit markets, we may be required to pay a potential withdrawal liability if the plans were under funded at the time of withdrawal. However, we are unable to determine the amount of potential liability at this time. Any adjustments will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and it is determined that markets will be exited. Stock Option Plans We apply Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations in accounting for our stock option plans. Accordingly, because the exercise price of the option granted equals the market value of the underlying stock on the option grant date, no stock based compensation expense is included in net earnings, other than expenses related to restricted stock awards. Notes 1 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describe the effect on net earnings if compensation cost for all options had been determined based on the fair market value at the grant date for awards, consistent with the methodology prescribed under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (principally on a LIFO basis) or market. In total, approximately 95% of inventories for 2002 and approximately 94% of inventories for 2001 were valued using the LIFO method. Cost for the balance of the inventories was determined using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. Replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by $290 million at February 1, 2003, and by $340 million at February 2, 2002. As described above in Significant Items, we changed our application of the LIFO method of accounting for certain store inventories from the retail method to the item cost method for the former Fred Meyer divisions during 2002. We evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities. We record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of these counts to provide for estimated shortages as of the balance sheet date. Revenue Recognition Revenues from the sale of products are recognized at the point of sale of our products. Discounts provided to customers at the point of sale are recognized as a reduction in sales as the products are sold. Merchandise Costs, including Advertising, Warehousing and Transportation In addition to the product costs, net of discounts and allowances; advertising costs; inbound freight charges; warehousing costs, including receiving and inspection costs; and transportation costs are included in the Merchandise costs, including advertising, warehousing and transportation line item of the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Purchasing management salaries and administration costs are included in the Operating, general, and administrative line item along with most of our other managerial and administrative costs. Warehousing and transportation costs include distribution center direct wages, repairs and maintenance, utilities, inbound freight and, where applicable, third party warehouse management fees, as well as transportation direct wages and repairs and maintenance. These costs are recognized in the periods the related expenses are incurred. Advertising costs are recognized in the periods the related expenses are incurred. Whenever possible, vendor rebates, credits and promotional allowances that relate to our buying and merchandising activities are recorded as a component of item cost in inventory and recognized in merchandise costs when the item is sold. Due to system constraints and the nature of certain allowances, it is sometimes not practicable to apply allowances to the item cost of inventory. In those instances, the allowances are applied as a reduction of merchandise costs when the related merchandise is sold. We believe the classification of costs included in merchandise costs could vary widely throughout our industry. Our approach is to include the direct, net costs of acquiring products and making them available to customers in our stores in the merchandise cost line item. We believe this approach most accurately presents the actual costs of products sold, and is consistent with recently issued accounting standards on the topic. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flow Information Cash from operations was $3.2 billion in 2002 compared to $2.3 billion in 2001 and $2.4 billion in 2000. The increase in 2002 over 2001 was due to an increase in earnings and a reduction of operating assets and liabilities. Increased earnings in 2001 were offset by increases in the use of cash for operating assets and liabilities. Cash used by investing activities was $1.9 billion in 2002 compared to $1.9 billion in 2001 and $1.6 billion in 2000. The amount of cash used by investing activities in 2002 was approximately equal to the amount used in 2001 due to consistent capital spending in 2002 and 2001. Capital expenditures in 2002 included $192 million related to the purchase of assets previously financed under a synthetic lease. The increase in 2001 over 2000 was due to increased capital spending. During 2002, 2001, and 2000, our capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, totaled $1,891 million, $1,913 million and $1,623 million, respectively. We spent $126 million for acquisitions during 2002 compared to $103 million during 2001 and $67 million in 2000. We opened, acquired, expanded, or relocated 151 food stores in 2002, 146 food stores in 2001 and 150 food stores in 2000. During those same periods, we remodeled 145, 99 and 115 food stores, respectively. Cash used by financing activities was $1.3 billion in 2002 compared to $433 million in 2001 and $878 million in 2000. The increase in the use of cash in 2002 versus 2001 was due to a reduction of our outstanding debt and to an increase in our treasury stock purchases in 2002. The decrease in the use of cash in 2001 versus 2000 primarily was due to increased borrowings in 2001, offset by increased treasury stock purchases. EBITDA Our bank credit facilities and the indentures underlying our publicly issued debt contain various restrictive covenants. Some of these covenants are based on EBITDA, which we historically defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, LIFO, extraordinary losses and one time items. In prior years, we disclosed and discussed EBITDA accordingly, as we believed it was an important means by which to measure our liquidity or compliance with our debt covenants, and also a measure by which management monitored our operating results. Furthermore, that measure of EBITDA is used, in part, to determine incentive compensation. On January 22, 2003, the SEC issued release No. 33 8176 that set forth new requirements relating to the disclosure of non GAAP financial measures, as defined in the release. The release provides an exemption with respect to disclosures of EBIT and EBITDA when discussing charges or liabilities that require, or will require, cash settlement, provided that the amounts are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. However, the definition of EBITDA we have historically used includes an adjustment for non recurring, infrequent or unusual items (one time items), and our description of this non GAAP measure of liquidity could be considered confusingly similar to descriptions used for GAAP financial measures (and permitted non GAAP financial measures such as EBIT or EBITDA). As a result, the definition of EBITDA we have historically used is prohibited by SEC release No. 33 8176. We will continue to present EBITDA as we continue to believe it is an important means by which to measure our liquidity. However, any future presentation of EBITDA will be in accordance with SEC release No. 33 8176. We do not intend the presentation of EBITDA to be an alternative to any generally accepted accounting principle measure of performance or liquidity. The following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDA for the fiscal years of 2002, 2001 and 2000 consistent with release No. 33 8176: 2002 2001 2000 (In millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,183 $ 2,347 $ 2,359 Addback (subtract): Net increase (decrease) in net operating assets and liabilities, net of effects of acquisitions of businesses (306 ) 166 (43 ) Net (increase) decrease in deferred income tax liabilities (468 ) (258 ) (213 ) EITF 02 16 adoption (28 ) Item cost conversion (91 ) Asset impairment charges (91 ) (191 ) Non cash merger related costs (1 ) (4 ) (10 ) LIFO (charge) credit 50 (23 ) 6 Income tax expense 740 668 628 Interest expense 600 648 675 Other (19 ) (18 ) (20 ) EBITDA $ 3,660 $ 3,435 $ 3,191 Refer to Significant Items for details of items that significantly affected Krogers financial results during 2002, 2001 and 2000. Debt Management Total debt, including both the current and long term portions of capital leases, decreased $256 million to $8.6 billion as of year end 2002 from $8.8 billion as of year end 2001. Total debt increased $284 million as of year end 2001 from $8.5 billion as of year end 2000. The decrease in 2002 resulted from the use of cash flow from operations to reduce outstanding debt. The increase in 2001 was due to increases in capital spending, stock repurchase programs and operating assets and liabilities. We purchased a portion of the debt issued by the lenders of some of our structured financings in an effort to reduce our effective interest expense. We also prefunded employee benefit costs of $300 million at year end 2002, $270 million at year end 2001 and $208 million at year end 2000. Additionally, the mark to market adjustments necessary to record fair value interest rate hedges of our fixed rate debt, pursuant to SFAS No. 133, increased the carrying value of our debt by $110 million as of year end 2002 and reduced the carrying value of our debt by $18 million as of year end 2001. If we exclude the debt incurred to make these purchases, which we classify as investments, and the prefunding of employee benefits, and also exclude the SFAS No. 133 mark to market adjustments, our net total debt would have been $8.1 billion as of year end 2002, compared to $8.5 billion as of year end 2001 and $8.3 billion as of year end 2000. We believe net total debt is an important measure of our leverage due to the nature of the items described above. Therefore, we believe net total debt should be reviewed in addition to total debt. We do not intend the presentation of net total debt to be an alternative to total debt or to any generally accepted accounting principle measure of liquidity. A reconciliation of net total debt is illustrated below: YearEnd2002 YearEnd2001 YearEnd2000 (In millions) Total Debt $ 8,574 $ 8,830 $ 8,546 Mark to market adjustments (110 ) 18 Investments in debt securities (67 ) (68 ) (68 ) Prefunded employee benefits (VEBA) (300 ) (270 ) (208 ) Net Total Debt $ 8,097 $ 8,510 $ 8,270 Factors Affecting Liquidity We currently borrow on a daily basis approximately $500 million to $700 million under our unrated commercial paper (CP) program. These borrowings are backed by our credit facilities, and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facilities. We have capacity available under our credit facilities to fund all CP amounts outstanding. If our credit rating declined below its current level of BBB /Baa3, the ability to borrow under the CP program could be adversely affected for a period of time immediately following the reduction of our credit rating. This would require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facilities, under which we believe we have sufficient capacity. Borrowings under the credit facilities may be more costly than the money we borrow under our current CP program, depending on the current interest rate environment. However, in the event of a ratings decline, we do not anticipate that access to the CP markets currently available to us would be significantly limited for an extended period of time (i.e. in excess of 30 days). Although our ability to borrow under the credit facilities is not affected by our credit rating, the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facilities would be affected not only by a decrease in our credit rating, but also by a failure to maintain the financial covenants contained in our credit agreements. We were in compliance with these financial covenants as of February 1, 2003. The tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of February 1, 2003 (in millions of dollars): 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations Long term debt $ 329 $ 291 $ 799 $ 540 $ 590 $ 5,505 $ 8,054 Capital lease obligations, net of interest 23 23 23 24 24 293 410 Operating lease obligations 776 744 702 653 596 4,596 8,067 Construction commitments 133 20 16 169 Unconditional purchase obligations 391 138 100 85 6 720 $ 1,652 $ 1,216 $ 1,640 $ 1,302 $ 1,216 $ 10,394 $ 17,420 Other Commercial Commitments Credit facilities (1) $ $ $ $ $ 51 $ $ 51 Standby letters of credit 206 67 273 Surety bonds 292 292 Guarantees 8 5 13 Synthetic lease 202 202 $ 708 $ 67 $ $ $ 51 $ 5 $ 831 (1) These borrowings also are included in the long term debt contractual obligation amounts. The construction commitments include capital to be expended for projects that were either under construction, or for which a lease had been signed, as of February 1, 2003. Our unconditional purchase obligations include purchase commitments to be utilized in the normal course of business, such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our manufacturing plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and manufacturing facilities. The obligations include purchases required under a product supply agreement with Santee Dairies, Inc. (Santee) in Los Angeles, California. We indirectly own a 50% interest in the entity that owns Santee. Upon Fred Meyers acquisition of Ralphs/Food 4 Less, Santee became a duplicate facility. The product supply agreement, which expires on July 29, 2007, requires us to purchase 9 million gallons of fluid milk and other products annually. The other partner has filed suit against Kroger claiming, among other things, that the Company is obligated to purchase all of the requirements of fluid milk for its Ralphs and Food 4 Less divisions from Santee as opposed to minimum gallons. Our unconditional purchase obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties. As of February 1, 2003, we maintained three bank credit facilities, consisting of an $812.5 million Five Year Credit Agreement, a $700 million Five Year Credit Agreement and a $1.25 billion 364 Day Credit Agreement. The $812.5 million five year facility terminates on May 23, 2006, unless extended or earlier terminated by Kroger. The $700 million five year facility terminates on May 22, 2007, unless extended or earlier terminated by Kroger. The 364 Day facility terminates on May 22, 2003, unless extended, converted into a one year term loan, or earlier terminated by Kroger. At February 1, 2003, we also maintained a $75 million money market line. In addition to credit agreement and commercial paper borrowings, borrowings under the money market line and some outstanding letters of credit reduce funds available under the credit agreements. At February 1, 2003, those letters of credit totaled $258 million. We had no borrowings under the money market line at February 1, 2003. The credit agreement and commercial paper borrowings have been classified as long term borrowings because we expect that these borrowings will be refinanced using the same type of securities. We have the ability to refinance these borrowings on a long term basis, and have presented the amounts accordingly. The money market line borrowings allow us to borrow from banks at mutually agreed upon rates, usually at rates below the rates offered under the credit agreements. At February 1, 2003, the amount of outstanding credit agreement and commercial paper borrowings was unusually low, relative to the amount of outstanding Senior Notes, due primarily to the issuance of $500 million Senior Notes in late January of 2003. The proceeds of this issuance were used to temporarily reduce amounts outstanding under the credit agreements prior to the purchase, on February 28, 2003, of the assets that were financed under a synthetic lease at February 1, 2003, and the repayment of $250 million Senior Notes on March 3, 2003. The asset purchase and note repayments were funded primarily by credit agreement borrowings. The synthetic lease is more fully described below. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of our debt obligations. In addition to the available credit mentioned above, as of February 1, 2003, we had available for issuance $1.5 billion of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC on June 27, 2002, as amended in a filing made on July 18, 2002, and declared effective on July 23, 2002. We also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our self insured insurance costs. These bonds are required by most states in which we are self insured for workers compensation and general liability exposures, and are made with third party insurance providers to insure payment of our insurance obligations in the event we are unable to make those payments. These bonds do not represent liabilities of Kroger, as we already have liabilities on our books for the insurance costs. However, we do pay annual maintenance fees to have these bonds in place. Market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and, in some instances, availability of these bonds may become more limited, which could affect our costs of or access to such bonds. Although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly impact our ability to access these surety bonds, if this does become an issue, we likely would issue letters of credit against our credit facilities to meet the state bonding requirements. This could both increase our costs and decrease the funds available to us under our credit facilities. Most of our outstanding public debt is jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed by The Kroger Co. and some of its subsidiaries. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of those arrangements. In addition, we have guaranteed half of the indebtedness of two real estate joint ventures in which we are a partner with 50% ownership. Our share of the responsibility for this indebtednesss, should these partnerships be unable to meet their obligations, totals approximately $8 million. Based on the covenants underlying this indebtedness as of February 1, 2003, it is unlikely that we will be responsible for repayment of these obligations. We have also guaranteed approximately $5 million of promissory notes of a third real estate partnership. We believe it is reasonably possible that we will be required to fund most of this obligation when the notes mature in 2012. At February 1, 2003, we were a party to a financing transaction related to 16 properties that were constructed for total costs of approximately $202 million. Under the terms of the financing transaction, which was structured as a synthetic lease, a special purpose trust owned the properties and leased them to subsidiaries of Kroger. The lease had a term of five years, which expired on February 28, 2003. The owner of the special purpose trust made a substantive residual equity investment. The transaction, therefore, was accounted for as an operating lease and the related costs were reported as rent expense. Kroger purchased the assets for total costs of $202 million when the lease expired. We are also contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions. We could be required to assume leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations. Due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties, and various other remedies available to us, we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote. IMPACT OF INFLATION While management believes that Krogers sales results are affected by product cost inflation and deflation, it is difficult to segregate and to measure the effects of inflation and deflation on our retail prices because of changes in the types of merchandise sold year to year and other pricing and competitive influences. In 2002, we estimate that Kroger experienced overall product cost deflation of 0.3%. Excluding supermarket fuel centers, we estimate our product cost deflation was also 0.3%. We recorded a pre tax LIFO credit of $50 million in 2002. This amount was larger than expected and included a $28 million pre tax credit recorded as a result of the adoption of EITF 02 16. Product cost deflation in our jewelry divisions and in the general merchandise departments in our Fred Meyer stores accounted for most of the remaining $22 million pre tax credit. We estimate that Kroger experienced overall product cost inflation of 0.1% in 2001. We experienced deflation in our costs of product of some commodities due to managements success in obtaining synergies and the economies of scale resulting from recent mergers. Costs of other commodities, such as pharmacy and general merchandise, increased in 2001. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS EITF Issue No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor, became effective for Kroger on January 1, 2003. This issue addresses the appropriate accounting for consideration received from a vendor. Due to system constraints and the nature of certain allowances, it is sometimes not practicable to apply allowances to the item cost of inventory. Historically, we recognized those allowances as they were earned, based on the fulfillment of the related obligations of the contract. This accounting treatment was consistent with generally accepted accounting principles. For all contracts entered or modified after January 1, 2003, we have recognized prospectively, and will continue to recognize, vendor allowances when the related merchandise is sold, in accordance with Issue No. 02 16. Net earnings were not affected by the adoption of Issue No. 02 16. Adoption of Issue No. 02 16 resulted in a $28 million pre tax charge that was included in merchandise costs in 2002. This expense was offset by a corresponding $28 million pre tax LIFO credit that was also included in merchandise costs in 2002. SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in June of 2001. This standard requires that all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The Statement also addresses the recognition of intangible assets in a business combination. Adoption of SFAS No. 141 did not have a material effect on our financial statements. SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, was issued by the FASB in June of 2001. The Statement addresses the accounting for intangible assets acquired outside of a business combination. The Statement also addresses the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to initial recognition. SFAS No. 142 provides that goodwill no longer will be amortized and instead will be tested for impairment on an annual basis. Kroger adopted SFAS No. 142 on February 3, 2002. Accordingly, we performed a transitional impairment review of our goodwill. Goodwill totaled $3,594 million as of February 3, 2002. The review was performed at the operating division level. Generally, fair value represented a multiple of earnings, or discounted projected future cash flows. Impairment was indicated when the carrying value of a division, including goodwill, exceeded its fair value. We determined that the carrying value of the jewelry store division, which included $26 million of goodwill, exceeded its fair value. Impairment was not indicated for the goodwill associated with the other operating divisions. The fair value of the jewelry store division was subsequently measured against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities, excluding goodwill, to estimate an implied fair value of the divisions goodwill. As a result of this analysis, we determined that the jewelry store division goodwill was entirely impaired. Impairment primarily resulted from the recent operating performance of the division and review of the divisions projected future cash flows on a discounted basis, rather than on an undiscounted basis, as was the standard under SFAS No. 121, prior to adoption of SFAS No. 142. Accordingly, we recorded a $16 million charge, net of a $10 million tax benefit, as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in the first quarter of 2002. Krogers annual impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of 2002. No impairment was indicated as a result of the fourth quarter 2002, review. SFAS No. 143, Asset Retirement Obligations, was issued by the FASB in August of 2001. This standard addresses obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. SFAS No. 143 became effective for Kroger on February 2, 2003. Adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial statements. SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, was issued by the FASB in August of 2001. This standard replaces SFAS No. 121 and APB No. 30 and amends APB No. 51. SFAS No. 144 became effective for Kroger on February 3, 2002. Adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial statements. SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections, was issued by the FASB in April of 2002. SFAS No. 145 became effective for Kroger on February 2, 2003. This Statement eliminates the requirement that gains and losses due to the extinguishment of debt be aggregated and, if material, classified as an extraordinary item, net of the related income tax effect. Adoption of SFAS No. 145 in the first quarter of 2003 will require Kroger to reclassify the debt extinguishments recorded as extraordinary items in 2002 and 2000 as interest expense in the respective years. SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, was issued by the FASB in June of 2002. SFAS No. 146 addresses significant issues relating to the recognition, measurement and reporting of costs associated with exit and disposal activities. SFAS No. 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. All closed store liabilities related to exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002, have been and will continue to be accounted for accordingly. Adoption of this Statement did not have a material effect on our financial statements. SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, an Amendment of SFAS No. 123, was issued by the FASB in December of 2002. SFAS No. 148 addresses the transition methods that can be followed by companies that elect to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 123. SFAS No. 148 also mandates certain annual and interim disclosures that are incremental to those required by SFAS No. 123. The provisions of SFAS No. 148 became effective for Kroger in fiscal 2002. The additional disclosures required by SFAS No. 148 are included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. FASB Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, was issued by the FASB in November of 2002. FIN 45 addresses a guarantors accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of some guarantees. The provisions of FIN 45 relating to initial recognition and measurement are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. These provisions did not have a material effect on our financial statements in fiscal 2002. The disclosure requirements of FIN 45 became effective for Kroger in fiscal 2002 and are summarized in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The disclosures also are summarized above in Factors Affecting Liquidity. Any future guarantees issued by Kroger will be accounted for in compliance with this Interpretation. FASB Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, was issued by the FASB in January of 2003. FIN 46 provides guidance relating to the identification of, and financial reporting for, variable interest entities, as defined in the Interpretation. FIN 46 is effective for all variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. For any variable interest entities created prior to February 1, 2003, FIN 46 will become effective for Kroger on August 17, 2003. We are analyzing our structured financing arrangements, joint ventures and partnerships to determine the effect this Interpretation will have on our financial statements. If we are required to consolidate any entity, we anticipate that such consolidation will not have a material effect on our financial statements. OUTLOOK This analysis contains certain forward looking statements about Krogers future performance. These statements are based on managements assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available. Such statements relate to, among other things: projected growth in earnings per share (EPS); working capital reduction; our ability to generate operating cash flow; and our Strategic Growth Plan (Plan), and are indicated by words or phrases such as comfortable, committed, expects, goal, target, and similar words or phrases. These forward looking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations, projections, beliefs, intentions or strategies are forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21 E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. While we believe that the statements are accurate, uncertainties about the general economy, our labor relations, our ability to execute our plans on a timely basis and other uncertainties described below could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements. On December 11, 2001, we outlined the Plan to support additional investment in core business to grow sales and increase market share. The Plan has three key elements: reduction of operating, general and administrative expenses, increased coordination of merchandising and procurement activities, and targeted retail price reductions. As of February 1, 2003, we had reduced costs by approximately $306 million. In 2002, we eliminated approximately 1,500 managerial and clerical positions targeted for reduction under the Plan. We also merged the Nashville division office and distribution center into the Atlanta and Mid South divisions. We expect to exceed our original goal of $500 million in cost reductions by the end of fiscal 2003. Our identical food store sales, including supermarket fuel centers, were flat in 2002 compared to 2001. We believe the effects of the weak economy and increased competition partially offset the effects of Krogers price reductions associated with the Plan in 2002. Our sales results are further described above in Results of Operations. The estimated impact of product cost deflation is described above in Impact of Inflation. As of February 1, 2003, restructuring costs related to the Plan totaled approximately $52 million. These charges related primarily to severance agreements, distribution center consolidation and conversion costs. We believe the continued enhancement of the Plan will improve our competitive position. We have identified additional opportunities to reduce costs and operate more efficiently. For example, in March of 2003, we announced the combining of two retail divisions headquartered in Livonia, Michigan, and Columbus, Ohio. For 2003, we estimate that earnings per share will be $1.63. This estimate includes approximately $0.02 of expense per share for systems conversions and the consolidation of the Michigan and Columbus divisions. The estimate also includes increases in pension expense and health care costs. The effect of any mark to market of the excess energy purchase commitments described above in Significant Items is excluded from our 2003 EPS estimate because it is not possible to estimate an effect at this time. We expect our identical food store sales, including fuel, will be positive in 2003. These estimates assume that inflation will be flat and that the economic and competitive environment will remain unchanged. At this time, we are not providing sales or earnings guidance beyond fiscal 2003. Based on the current interest rate environment, we expect interest expense to total approximately $575 million to $595 million in 2003. Additionally, for 2003, we expect depreciation expense to total approximately $1,175 million to $1,200 million. We expect our OG&A expense rate to increase approximately 40 to 50 basis points and our gross profit rate, excluding the effect of LIFO, to increase approximately 20 to 30 basis points in 2003. We expect to incur a LIFO charge of approximately $35 million for 2003. In the third quarter of 1999, we established a goal to reduce net operating working capital by a total of $500 million by the end of the third quarter 2004. Net operating working capital was defined in this goal as current operating assets before LIFO credit, less current operating liabilities. Therefore, we historically presented net operating working capital based on this definition. On January 22, 2003, the SEC issued release No. 33 8176 that set forth new requirements relating to the disclosure of non GAAP financial measures, as defined in the release. The release allows for presentation of certain non GAAP financial measures provided that the measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We will continue to present net operating working capital, as we believe it is an important means by which to measure our operating financial performance for working capital and it is the basis by which senior management measures progress against the goal established in 1999. However, in accordance with release No. 33 8176, all future presentation of net operating working capital will be reconciled to the more widely recognized definition of working capital (current assets less current liabilities). We do not intend the presentation of net operating working capital to be an alternative to any generally accepted accounting principle measure of performance. At the end of 2002, working capital decreased $69 million compared to the end of 2001 and decreased $72 million compared to end of 2000. At the end of 2002, comparative net operating working capital decreased $193 million compared to the end of 2001 and decreased $50 million compared to the end of 2000. We expect to reduce net operating working capital by $100 million in 2003. A reconciliation of net operating working capital as of year end 2002, 2001 and 2000 is shown below: Year End2002 Year End2001 Year End2000 (in millions) Current assets $ 5,566 $ 5,512 $ 5,412 Less: current liabilities (5,608 ) (5,485 ) (5,382 ) Working capital (42 ) 27 30 Addback (subtract): LIFO reserve 290 340 319 Current portion of long term debt, including capital leases 352 436 336 Net current accrued/deferred income tax (assets) liabilities 56 122 34 Property held for sale (20 ) (7 ) (6 ) Prefunded employee benefits (300 ) (270 ) (208 ) Net operating working capital 336 648 505 Item cost comparative adjustment (1) (91 ) (91 ) EITF 02 16 comparative adjustment (1) (28 ) (28 ) Comparative net operating working capital $ 336 $ 529 $ 386 (1) For comparative purposes, amounts in 2001 and 2000 have been adjusted to reflect these inventory adjustments recorded in 2002. These adjustments are described in Significant Items. We obtain sales growth from new square footage, as well as from increased productivity from existing locations. For 2003, we expect full year square footage to grow 2.5% to 3.0%, excluding acquisitions and operational closings. We expect combination stores to increase our sales per customer by including numerous specialty departments, such as pharmacies, natural food markets, supermarket fuel centers, seafood shops, floral shops, and bakeries. We believe the combination store format will allow us to withstand continued competition from other food retailers, supercenters, mass merchandisers, club or warehouse stores, drug stores and restaurants. Capital expenditures reflect our strategy of growth through expansion and acquisition as well as our emphasis on self development and ownership of real estate, and on logistics and technology improvements. The continued capital spending in technology focusing on improved store operations, logistics, manufacturing procurement, category management, merchandising and buying practices, should reduce merchandising costs as a percent of sales. For fiscal 2003, we expect capital spending to be approximately $2.0 billion, excluding acquisitions and purchase of assets financed under the synthetic lease at February 1, 2003. We intend to use the combination of cash flow from operations, including reductions in working capital, and borrowings under credit facilities to finance capital expenditure requirements. If determined preferable, we may fund capital expenditure requirements by mortgaging facilities, entering into sale/leaseback transactions, or by issuing additional debt or equity. Based on current operating results, we believe that cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity, including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facilities, will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, interest payments and scheduled principal payments for the foreseeable future. We also believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to respond effectively to competitive conditions. We expect the change in OG&A will be affected by increased costs, such as health care benefit costs, pension costs and credit card fees. We expect that our pension and health care benefit expense will increase approximately $62 million and $120 million, respectively, in 2003 versus 2002. These estimates include expenses related to our company sponsored plans as well as estimated contributions to multi employer plans. Various uncertainties and other factors could cause us to fail to achieve our goals. These include: Our ability to achieve sales and EPS goals will be affected primarily by: industry consolidation; pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors, including non traditional competitors; our response to these actions; the state of the economy, including the deflationary trends in certain commodities; stock repurchases and the success of our Plan. In addition to the factors identified above, our identical store sales growth could be affected by increases in Kroger private label sales, the impact of sister stores, as well as reductions in retail pricing. Krogers EPS growth goals could be affected by: recessionary trends in the economy; our ability to achieve the cost reductions that we have identified, including those to reduce shrink and OG&A; continued increases in health care, pension and credit card fees; and the success of our capital investments. In addition to the company sponsored pension plans, we participate in various multi employer pension plans for substantially all union employees. We are required to make contributions to these plans in amounts established under collective bargaining agreements. Pension expense for these plans is recognized as contributions are funded. Benefits are generally based upon a fixed amount for each year of service. A decline in the value of assets held by these plans, caused by performance of the investments in the financial markets in recent years, is likely to result in higher contributions to these plans and to create challenges in our collective bargaining. Moreover, if we were to exit certain markets, we may be required to pay a withdrawal liability if the plans were under funded at the time of withdrawal. Our efforts to meet our working capital reduction targets could be adversely affected by: increases in product costs; newly opened or consolidated distribution centers; our ability to obtain sales growth from new square footage; competitive activity in the markets in which we operate; changes in our product mix; and changes in laws and regulations. The results of our Plan and our ability to generate operating cash flow to the extent expected could be adversely affected if any of the factors identified above negatively impacts our operations, or if any of our underlying strategies, including those to reduce shrink and OG&A and to increase productivity, are not achieved. In addition, the timing of the execution of the Plan could adversely impact our EPS and sales results. Consolidation in the food industry is likely to continue and the effects on our business, favorable or unfavorable, cannot be foreseen. The results of our Plan, including the amount and timing of cost savings expected, could be adversely affected due to pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors, including non traditional retailers; our response actions; the state of the economy, including deflationary trends in certain commodities; recessionary times in the economy; our ability to achieve the cost reductions that we have identified, including those to reduce shrink and operating, general and administrative expense; increases in health care, pension and credit card fees; and the success of our capital investments. The cost associated with implementation of our Strategic Growth Plan, as well as the amount and timing of our expected cost reductions, could be affected by a worsening economy; increased competitive pressures; and an inability on our part to implement the Strategic Growth Plan when expected. In fiscal 2003, UFCW contracts will expire in: Peoria, Illinois; Portland, Oregon; Memphis, Tennessee; Charleston, West Virginia; Indianapolis, Indiana; Arizona and Southern California. We also have several other smaller contracts that will expire in 2003. In all of these contracts, rising health care and pension costs will continue to be an important issue in negotiations. We cannot be certain that agreements will be reached without work stoppage. A prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of stores could have a material effect on the results of our operations. Depreciation expense, which includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital leases, is computed principally using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of individual assets, or remaining terms of leases. Use of the straight line method of depreciation creates a risk that future assets write offs or potential impairment charges related to store closings would be larger than if an accelerated method of depreciation was followed. A decline in the generation of sufficient cash flows to support capital expansion plans, share repurchase programs and general operating activities could cause our growth to slow significantly and may cause us to miss our earnings per share growth targets, because we obtain some of our sales growth from new square footage. The grocery retailing industry continues to experience fierce competition from other food retailers, supercenters, mass merchandisers, club or warehouse stores, drug stores and restaurants. Our continued success is dependent upon our ability to compete in this industry and continue to reduce operating expenses, including managing health care and pension costs contained in our collective bargaining agreements. The competitive environment may cause us to reduce our prices in order to gain or maintain share of sales, thus reducing margins. While we believe our opportunities for sustained, profitable growth are considerable, unanticipated actions of competitors could impact our sales and net income. Changes in laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, and environmental laws may have a material impact on our financial statements. Changes in the general business and economic conditions in our operating regions, including the rate of inflation, population growth, and employment and job growth in the markets in which we operate may affect our ability to hire and train qualified employees to operate our stores. This would negatively affect earnings and sales growth. General economic changes may also affect the shopping habits of our customers, which could affect sales and earnings. Changes in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial indicators. For example, we have added and will continue to add supermarket fuel centers. Since gasoline is a low profit margin item with high sales dollars, we expect to see our gross profit margins decrease as we sell more gasoline. Although this negatively affects our gross profit margin, gasoline provides a positive effect on operating, general and administrative expense as a percent of sales. Our ability to integrate any companies we acquire or have acquired and achieve operating improvements at those companies will affect our operations. We retain a portion of the exposure for our workers compensation and general liability claims. It is possible that these claims may cause significant expenditures that would affect our operating cash flows. Our capital expenditures could differ from our estimate if we are unsuccessful in acquiring suitable sites for new stores, if development costs vary from those budgeted, or if our logistics and technology projects are not completed in the time frame expected or on budget. Depreciation and amortization expenses may vary from our estimates due to the timing of new store openings. Interest expense will vary with changes in capital markets and the amount of debt that we have outstanding. Although we use derivative financial instruments to manage our net exposure to financial risks, we are still exposed to interest rate fluctuations and other capital market conditions. LIFO charges and credits will be affected by vendor promotions and changes in the cost of inventory. Adverse weather conditions could increase the cost our suppliers charge for their products, or may decrease the customer demand for certain products. Additionally, increases in the cost of inputs, such as utility costs or raw material costs, could negatively impact financial ratios and net earnings. Although we presently operate only in the United States, civil unrest in foreign countries in which our suppliers do business may affect the prices we are charged for imported goods. If we are unable to pass these increases on to our customers, our gross margin and net earnings will suffer. We cannot fully foresee the effects of the general economic downturn on Krogers business. We have assumed economic and competitive situations will not change significantly for 2003. Other factors and assumptions not identified above could also cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking information. Accordingly, actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in or contemplated or implied by forward looking statements made by us or our representatives. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Risk Management We use derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. As a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure. Because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure, fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure. The interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets. We manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of variable and fixed rate debt, and interest rate swaps. Our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates both fixing the rates on variable rate debt and hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. To do this, we use the following guidelines: (i) use average daily bank balance to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure, (ii) limit the annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of $2.3 billion or less, (iii) include no leveraged products, and (iv) hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current mark to market status. As of February 1, 2003, we maintained seven interest rate swap agreements, with notional amounts totaling approximately $1,673 million, to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates. One of these agreements matured in 2003 and the remaining six agreements (the Old Agreements) matured from 2006 through 2012. In the first quarter of fiscal 2003, we reconfigured a portion of our interest derivative portfolio by terminating the Old Agreements and initiating six new agreements (the New Agreements), with notional amounts totaling $1,500 million, maturing from 2005 through 2008. We received proceeds totaling $138 million as a result of the termination of the Old Agreements. The New Agreements also effectively converted a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates. Variable rates for our agreements are based on U.S. dollar LIBOR. The differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements and is recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense. These agreements are accounted for as fair value hedges. As of February 1, 2003, we also maintained three interest rate swap agreements, with notional amounts totaling approximately $723 million, to manage our exposure to cash flows resulting from potential increases in interest rates by effectively converting a portion of our debt from variable to fixed rates. These agreements, which mature in 2003 and 2004, involve the exchange of variable rate payments for fixed rate payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts. Variable rates for our agreements are based on U.S. dollar LIBOR. The differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements and is recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense. These agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges. Annually, we review with the Financial Policy Committee of our Board of Directors compliance with the guidelines. In addition, our internal auditors review compliance with these guidelines on at least an annual basis. The guidelines may change as our business needs dictate. The tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives and underlying debt portfolio as of February 1, 2003. The amount shown for each year represents the contractual maturities of long term debt, excluding capital leases, and the average outstanding notional amounts of interest rate derivatives as of February 1, 2003. Interest rates reflect the weighted average for the outstanding instruments. The variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on U.S. dollar LIBOR using the forward yield curve as of February 1, 2003. The Fair Value column includes the fair value of our debt instruments and interest rate derivatives as of February 1, 2003.

The variable component of each interest rate derivative is based on U.S. dollar LIBOR using the forward yield curve as of February 1, 2003. Average Notional Amounts Outstanding (adjusted) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter Total Fair Value (In millions) Interest Rate Derivatives Variable to fixed $ 540 $ 12 $ $ $ $ $ 723 $ (9 ) Average pay rate 3.07 % 3.22 % Average receive rate 1.36 % 1.96 % Fixed to variable $ 1,519 $ 1,500 $ 808 $ 750 $ 750 $ 750 $ 1,750 $ Average pay rate 5.78 % 6.64 % 7.61 % 8.41 % 8.90 % 9.24 % Average receive rate 7.41 % 7.41 % 7.44 % 7.45 % 7.45 % 7.45 % Interest rate collar $ 142 $ $ $ $ $ $ 300 $ (6 ) The interest rate collar is reset based on the three month LIBOR with the following impact: if the three month LIBOR is less than or equal to 4.10%, we pay 5.50% for that three month period; if the three month LIBOR is greater than 4.10% and less than or equal to 6.50%, we pay the actual interest rate for that three month period; if the three month LIBOR is greater than 6.50% and less than 7.50%, we pay 6.50% for that three month period; and if the three month LIBOR is greater than or equal to 7.50%, we pay the actual interest rate for that three month period. Commodity Price Protection We enter into purchase commitments for various resources, including raw materials utilized in our manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in our stores, manufacturing facilities and administrative offices. We enter into commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of normal business. Those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in the normal course of business qualify as normal purchases and normal sales. For any commitments for which we do not expect to take delivery and, as a result, will require net settlement, the contracts are marked to fair value on a quarterly basis. As noted above in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Significant Items, we recorded a pre tax loss of $81 million in the third quarter of 2001 to accrue liabilities for the estimated fair values of energy contracts that no longer qualified for the normal purchases and normal sales exception. As described in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we continue to mark the excess contracts to fair value on a quarterly basis. These liabilities had remaining balances of $45 million as of February 1, 2003. If the estimates we used as of February 1, 2003, for future market prices for electricity were $0.01/kWh higher or lower ($0.01/kWh represented approximately 23% of the future prices of electricity assumed as of February 1, 2003), these liabilities would have decreased or increased by approximately $12 million, respectively, as of February 1, 2003.
