ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OUR BUSINESS The Kroger Co. was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902. It is one of the nations largest retailers, operating 2,532 stores under two dozen banners including Kroger, Ralphs, Fred Meyer, Food 4 Less, King Soopers, Smiths, Frys, Frys Marketplace, Dillons, QFC and City Market. The Company also operates 795 convenience stores, 436 fine jewelry stores, and 536 supermarket fuel centers. Kroger operates 42 manufacturing plants, primarily bakeries and dairies, which supply about two thirds of the private label grocery products sold in the Companys retail outlets. Our revenues are earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores. We earn income predominately by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of our costs to make these products available to our customers. Such costs include procurement and distribution costs, facility occupancy and operational costs, and overhead expenses. The Companys operations are reported as a single operating segment: the retail sale of merchandise to individual customers. OUR 2004 PERFORMANCE The operating environment of the food retailing industry continues to be characterized by intense price competition, aggressive supercenter expansion, increasing fragmentation of retail formats, and market consolidation. Over the past several years, many traditional supermarket operators, including Kroger, have experienced declining profit margins. In an effort to maintain market share, we have lowered retail prices at a rate faster than we were able to reduce costs. Kroger recognized the major changes in the operating environment and in 2001 we implemented a plan to transition to a lower gross margin environment. During 2002 and 2003 our identical food store sales without fuel declined. In 2004 we were pleased with the progress of our identical sales, excluding the effect of fuel and the southern California labor dispute, which has now shown sequential improvement for seven of the past eight quarters. Identical food store sales on this same basis increased 1.2% in 2004. This nearly met the 1.3% target we established at the beginning of the year. This was accomplished by focusing on our customers needs of high quality perishable products and lowering selected prices. Our internal analysis shows that we hold the #1 or #2 position in 40 of our 52 major markets. We define a major market as one in which we operate nine or more stores. According to our internal market share estimates, which include all retail outlets including supercenters and other non traditional retail formats, Krogers market share increased in 23 of our 52 major markets in 2004, declined in 27 and remained unchanged in two. Six of the 27 markets in which our market share declined are in California, including five markets that were significantly affected by the southern California labor dispute. On a volume weighted basis, Krogers overall market share declined slightly in our 52 major markets. Our 2003 and 2004 financial results were affected by asset and goodwill impairment charges and two labor disputes that occurred in southern California and West Virginia. In West Virginia, we closed 44 stores starting October 13, 2003 when a strike was conducted by a local union of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW). These stores were reopened on December 11, 2003 after ratification of a new contract. In southern California, our Ralphs stores, as well as stores operated by Safeway, Inc. and Albertsons, Inc. were subject to a labor dispute that started on October 12, 2003 and ended 141 days later on February 29, 2004. We are working hard to rebuild our business in this region. The recovery from the labor dispute has been slower than we expected. We continue to emphasize store conditions, associate training, associate engagement and competitive pricing. We are making progress and have a plan in place to return sales to pre strike levels. Excluding the impairment charges and the effect of the strikes, our net earnings still declined in 2004. Our increased sales did not translate to increased bottom line earnings. The competitive environments pressure on retail prices combined with increased inflation in product costs and increasingly price conscience consumers have resulted in lower gross profit. Additionally, increases in operating and administrative costs, especially employee health care costs and pension costs have been increasing at a higher rate than sales. FUTURE EXPECTATIONS We believe that Kroger is now positioned, despite intense price competition, to increase total sales, identical store sales, and earnings. Krogers plan starts with the customer. We are listening to our customers through research and focus groups. Our plan centers around those areas that our customers have told us are important. Our focus is on differentiating our stores, being competitive on price, and providing our customers a superior shopping experience as compared to our competitors, in terms of service, product quality, and variety. The plan should allow us to build a stronger relationship with our customers, position Kroger as the retailer of choice, and generate a satisfactory return for our shareholders. Significant, sustainable cost reductions will enable us to achieve our plan. Costs savings will be derived from areas such as process improvements, restructured labor contracts that will allow us to remain competitive, lower product costs, and technology utilization. Krogers financial strength is an important competitive advantage. Our free cash flow permits us to upgrade and expand our asset base in order to offer customers clean, modern stores that enhance their shopping experience. Our cash flow also enables us to continue reducing debt and buy back stock. In addition to financial strength, Kroger has many other key strengths such as a high quality asset base with leading market shares, broad geographic diversity, multiple retail formats, customer loyalty data and data analysis capability, a successful track record against supercenter competition and industry leading corporate brands. Kroger is focused on consistently meeting the needs of our customers by providing improved service, selection and value. Our associates are key to Krogers success. We expect the successful execution of our strategy will be clearly evident in our 2005 financial results. Further discussion on our industry, the current economic environment and our related strategic plans is included in Outlook. RESTATEMENT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS We restated our consolidated financial statements as of January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004 and for the three years ended January 29, 2005, January 31, 2004 and February 1, 2003. As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the restatement corrects errors identified in our deferred income tax accounts pertaining to (i) differences between the income tax basis and the financial reporting basis of certain assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations and the related effect on recorded goodwill and (ii) differences between the income tax basis and the financial reporting basis of long lived assets that were not reconciled to the deferred tax balances. The correction of the above noted errors reduced 2004 and 2003 net earnings (due to increases in goodwill impairment charges) by $4 million and $ 27 million, respectively. These adjustments reduced 2004 and 2003 diluted earnings per share by $0.00 and $0.04, respectively. These adjustments had no effect on cash flow from operations. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion summarizes our operating results for 2004 compared to 2003 and for 2003 compared to 2002. Comparability is affected by certain income and expense items that fluctuated significantly between and among the periods, including goodwill and asset impairment charges and labor disputes in West Virginia and southern California. These items are identified and discussed in more detail below in Other Items and Estimated Effect of Labor Disputes. Net Earnings (Loss) We recorded a net loss totaling $104 million, or $0.14 per share, for 2004, compared to net earnings totaling $285 million, or $0.38 per diluted share (as restated), in 2003 and net earnings of $1,202 million, or $1.52 per diluted share, in 2002. The decrease in net earnings in 2004 and 2003 was significantly affected by labor disputes as well as goodwill and asset impairment charges. These items are more fully described below in Other Items and Estimated Effect Of Labor Disputes. Lower gross margins, a result of our investment in pricing due to the competitive operating environment, also affect our year to year net earnings results. Sales Total Sales (in millions) 2004 PercentageIncrease 2003 Percentage Increase 2002 Total food store sales without fuel $ 51,106.2 2.9 % $ 49,650.0 2.8 % $ 48,295.1 Total food store fuel sales 2,305.2 59.0 % 1,449.9 60.7 % 902.5 Total food store sales $ 53,411.4 4.5 % $ 51,099.9 3.9 % $ 49,197.6 Other sales 3,023.0 12.3 % 2,690.9 5.0 % 2,561.9 Total Sales $ 56,434.4 4.9 % $ 53,790.8 3.9 % $ 51,759.5 The change in our total sales is driven by identical store sales and square footage growth, as well as inflation in fuel and other commodities. We define a food store as an identical store when the store has been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters. We calculate annualized identical food store sales based on a summation of four quarters of identical sales. Our annualized identical food store sales results are summarized below. Identical Food Store Sales (in millions) Excluding Stores Affected By Labor Disputes (1): 2004 2003 2004 2003 Dollars Including supermarket fuel centers $ 50,135.0 $ 49,110.1 $ 43,462.4 $ 42,338.3 Excluding supermarket fuel centers $ 48,068.0 $ 47,699.6 $ 41,427.9 $ 40,921.3 Percentage Increase Including supermarket fuel centers 2.1 % 0.4 % 2.7 % 0.7 % Excluding supermarket fuel centers 0.8 % (0.4 )% 1.2 % (0.2 )% We define a food store as a comparable store when the store has been in operation for five full quarters, including expansions and relocations. We calculate annualized comparable food store sales based on a summation of four quarters of comparable sales. Our annualized comparable food store sales results are summarized in the table below. Comparable Food Store Sales (in millions) Excluding Stores Affected By Labor Disputes (1): 2004 2003 2004 2003 Dollars Including supermarket fuel centers $ 51,581.9 $ 50,273.1 $ 44,796.4 $ 43,427.9 Excluding supermarket fuel centers $ 49,440.4 $ 48,814.5 $ 42,687.3 $ 41,992.8 Percentage Increase Including supermarket fuel centers 2.6 % 1.0 % 3.2 % 1.3 % Excluding supermarket fuel centers 1.3 % 0.1 % 1.7 % 0.3 % (1) Sales figures adjusted for the effects of the labor disputes exclude stores involved in labor disputes, as well as Food 4 Less stores whose sales results were favorably affected by the labor disputes in the southern California region. Our sales in 2004 were also affected by inflation and deflation in various commodity groups, our competitive operating environment, the recovery from the labor disputes in West Virginia and southern California and the results of our strategic initiatives. FIFO Gross Margin We calculate First In, First Out (FIFO) Gross Margin as follows: Sales minus merchandise costs plus Last In, First Out (LIFO) charge (credit). Merchandise costs include advertising, warehousing and transportation, but exclude depreciation expense and rent expense. FIFO gross margin is an important measure used by our management to evaluate merchandising and operational effectiveness. Our FIFO gross margin rates were 25.41%, 26.38% and 26.85% in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These declining rates reflect our continued investment in lower retail prices. Higher fuel sales that carry a low gross profit rate reduced our FIFO gross margin rates by 135, 93 and 69 basis points in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The southern California labor dispute and our related recovery efforts reduced gross profit rates in both 2004 and 2003. Additionally, other items recorded as merchandise costs in 2004, 2003 and 2002 further affected our FIFO gross margin rates. These items are more fully described below in Other Items and Estimated Effect of Labor Disputes. Operating, General and Administrative Expenses Operating, general and administrative (OG&A) expenses, which consist primarily of employee related costs such as wages, health care benefit costs and retirement plan costs, as a percent of sales were 18.80%, 19.25% and 18.58% in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Higher fuel sales reduced our OG&A rate by 105, 73 and 48 basis points in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The labor disputes and several items that are more fully described in Other Items and Estimated Effect of Labor Disputes affected our OG&A rates in 2004 and 2003. We continue to emphasize cost containment efforts in all areas and especially in the wage and benefit areas. In the fourth quarter of 2004, health care costs declined slightly as a percent of sales, the result of progress we have made during labor negotiations. We expect additional improvement in our OG&A rate in 2005, particularly as we leverage increasing sales and cost reductions in key areas of our business. Rent Expense Rent expense, as a percent of sales, was 1.21%, 1.22% and 1.27% in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decreases in these rates reflect our continued emphasis on ownership of real estate, partially offset by increased charges for the net present value of lease liabilities recorded for store closings. Depreciation Expense Depreciation expense, as a percent of sales, was 2.22%, 2.25% and 2.10% for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The change in these rates reflects our continued emphasis on ownership of real estate, offset by tightening of capital expenditures and the leveraging effect of increased sales. Interest Expense Net interest expense totaled $557 million, $604 million and $619 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decrease in interest expense is the result of lower average borrowings and lower average rates on outstanding debt. Interest expense in 2004, 2003 and 2002 included $25 million, $18 million and $19 million, respectively, related to the early retirement of debt, more fully described in Other Items. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 136.4%, 61.4% and 37.5% for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The effective tax rates for 2004 and 2003 differ from the effective tax rate for 2002 due to the impairment of non deductible goodwill in 2004 and 2003. The effective income tax rates also differ from the expected statutory rate in all years presented due to the effect of state taxes. OTHER ITEMS The following table summarizes items that affected Krogers financial results during the periods presented. These items should not be considered alternatives to net earnings, net cash provided by operating activities or any other Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) measure of performance or liquidity. These items should not be viewed in isolation or considered substitutes for Krogers results as reported in accordance with GAAP. These items include goodwill impairment charges, asset impairment charges, restructuring charges, merger related costs and the cumulative effect of an accounting change, all of which are shown separately in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The items also include charges and credits that were recorded as components of FIFO gross margin, LIFO charge (credit), OG&A expense and interest expense.

(2) Income tax benefits in 2004 and 2003 are affected by the non deductibility of the majority of the goodwill impairment charges. (3) The transitional impairment review required by the adoption of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets resulted in a write off of our jewelry store division goodwill. Items Affecting FIFO Gross Margin, LIFO Charge (Credit) and Operating, General and Administrative Expense Item cost conversion In 1998, prior to the merger with Fred Meyer, we changed our application of the LIFO method of accounting for certain store inventories from the retail method to the item cost method. The change improved the accuracy of product cost calculations by eliminating the averaging and estimating inherent in the retail method. During 2002, we adopted the item cost method for the former Fred Meyer divisions. The cumulative effect of this change on periods prior to February 3, 2002, cannot be determined. The effect of the change on the February 3, 2002 inventory valuations, which includes other immaterial modifications in inventory valuation methods, was included in results for the quarter ended May 25, 2002. This change increased merchandise costs by $91 million and reduced net earnings by $57 million. We did not calculate the pro forma effect on prior periods because we were unable to determine cost information for these periods. The item cost method did not have a material effect on earnings subsequent to adoption on February 3, 2002. Adoption of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 02 16 We adopted EITF Issue No. 02 16 during 2002. This issue addresses the method by which retailers account for vendor allowances. Due to system constraints and the nature of certain allowances, it is sometimes not practicable to apply allowances to the item cost of inventory. Historically, we had recognized those allowances as they were earned, based on the fulfillment of the related obligations of the contract. This accounting treatment was consistent with GAAP. For all contracts entered into or modified after January 1, 2003, we have recognized prospectively, and will continue to recognize, vendor allowances when the related merchandise is sold, in accordance with Issue 02 16. Net earnings in 2002 were not affected by the adoption of Issue No. 02 16. Adoption of the Issue resulted in a $28 million pre tax charge that was included in merchandise costs in 2002. This expense was offset by a corresponding $28 million pre tax LIFO credit that also was included in merchandise costs in 2002. Lease liabilities Store Closing Plans Due to operational changes, performance improved at five stores, not yet closed, for which store closing liabilities had been recorded as a part of a corporate level strategic plan. As a result of this improved performance, in 2003 we modified our original plans and determined that these five locations will remain open. Additionally, closing and exit costs at other locations included in the original plans were less costly than anticipated. In total, in 2003, we recorded pre tax income of $10 million to adjust these liabilities to reflect the outstanding lease commitments through 2020 at the locations remaining under the plans. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details of these liabilities. No charges were recorded in 2003 for the present value of lease liabilities for stores considered in the 2003 asset impairment review. In accordance with SFAS No. 146, which is effective for all exit and disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002, these liabilities will be recorded when these locations are closed. During fiscal 2004, we recorded lease liabilities totaling $24 million related to the closing of 41 of these stores. Excess energy purchase commitments During 2001, we recorded a pre tax charge of $81 million to accrue liabilities for the estimated fair value of energy purchase commitments that provided for supplies in excess of our expected demand for electricity. SFAS No. 133 required the excess commitments to be marked to fair value through current period earnings each quarter. We recorded pre tax expense of $4 million and pre tax income of $19 million as a result of the market value adjustment of these excess commitments in 2003 and 2002, respectively. During 2003, we reached an agreement through which we ended supply arrangements in California with Dynegy, Inc., related to these two contracts and two other electricity contracts that had been previously accounted for as normal purchases normal sales contracts. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved the agreement on July 23, 2003. During 2003, we paid $107 million, before the related tax benefits, to settle disputes with Dynegy related to prior over payments, terminate two of the four contracts effective July 6, 2003, and terminate the remaining two agreements effective September 1, 2003. As a result of the settlement, we recorded $62 million of pre tax expense in 2003. Property Tax Allowance In 2003, we recorded pre tax income of $20 million related to the reversal of a property tax accrual after we determined the amount to be paid would be less than we originally estimated. Power Outage In 2003, we recorded a $9 million pre tax expense for the August power outage in northwest Ohio and Michigan. The majority of the expense related to uninsured product losses. Generally, we classify uninsured product and property losses as OG&A expense. Adjustment to Charitable Contribution Liability In 2003, we recorded $5 million of pre tax income to adjust previously recorded liabilities related to charitable contributions required as a result of the Fred Meyer merger. We are required to make the remaining $14 million contribution by May 2006. Items Affecting Interest Expense We adopted SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections, in the first quarter of 2003. As a result, expenses related to the early retirement of debt, which were recorded as extraordinary items prior to the issuance of SFAS No. 145, are now classified as interest expense in the respective periods. The 2004 expenses of $3 million pre tax, related to a premium paid in connection with the redemption of our $750 million 7.375% bonds due March 2005, net of the effect of reduced interest expense for the balance of the year. The 2003 expenses of $18 million, pre tax, related to premiums paid in connection with the repurchase of $100 million of long term bonds, and the write off of the related deferred financing costs. Goodwill Impairment Charge We performed the annual evaluation of goodwill required by SFAS No. 142 during the fourth quarter of 2004. This review resulted in a $904 million non cash impairment charge (as restated) related to goodwill at our Ralphs and Food 4 Less divisions. The impairment charge, most of which is non deductible for income tax purposes, adjusted the carrying value of the divisions goodwill to its implied fair value. The divisions operating performance suffered due to the intense competitive environment following the 2003 southern California labor dispute and recovery period. The decreased operating performance was the result of the investments in personnel, training, capital and price reductions necessary to regain Ralphs lost business and to maintain business gained by Food 4 Less stores that were not subject to the labor dispute. As a result of this decline in operating performance, the divisions carrying value of goodwill exceeded its implied fair value resulting in the impairment charge. No impairment for goodwill at our other divisions was indicated during this review. During our annual review in 2003, we recorded a $471 million non cash goodwill impairment charge (as restated) related to the goodwill at our Smiths division following a substantial decline in the operating performance of the division compared to 2002 operating performance and expected future performance. Asset Impairment Charges and Related Items In accordance with our policy on impairment of long lived assets, we recorded impairment losses for both assets to be disposed of and assets to be held and used during 2003. These losses, which are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations as Asset impairment charges, totaled $120 million, pre tax. The impairment review was conducted as a consequence of a corporate level strategic plan that coordinated the closing of several locations over a relatively short period of time as a result of deteriorating operating performance. During the fourth quarter of 2003, we authorized closure of several stores throughout the country based on operating results for 2002 and 2003, as well as updated projections for 2004 and beyond. This event triggered an impairment review of stores slated for closure as well as several other under performing locations in the fourth quarter of 2003. These charges are more fully described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Restructuring Charges On December 11, 2001, we outlined our Strategic Growth Plan (the Plan) to support additional investment in our core business to increase sales and market share. Restructuring charges related to the Plan totaled $15 million, pre tax in 2002. The majority of the charge related to severance agreements, distribution center consolidation and conversion costs. No restructuring charges were recorded in 2004 and 2003. Merger Related Costs During 2002, we recorded pre tax expenses of $1 million from the issuance of restricted stock and the related market value adjustments. The restrictions on these stock awards lapsed in 2002 based on the achievement of synergy goals established in connection with the Fred Meyer merger. No merger related costs were recorded during 2004 or 2003. Please refer to Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details of this charge. Cumulative Effect of an Accounting Change We adopted SFAS No. 142 on February 3, 2002. The transitional impairment review required by SFAS No. 142 resulted in a $26 million pre tax, non cash loss to write off the goodwill at our jewelry store division based on its implied fair value. Impairment primarily resulted from the recent operating performance of the division and a review of the projected cash flows on a discounted basis, rather than an undiscounted basis, as was the standard under SFAS No. 121, prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 142. We recorded this loss as a cumulative effect of an accounting change, net of a $10 million tax benefit, in the first quarter of 2002. ESTIMATED EFFECT OF LABOR DISPUTES The following table summarizes the estimated effect of labor disputes on Krogers financial results. These items should not be considered alternatives to net earnings, net cash provided by operating activities or any other GAAP measure of performance or liquidity. These items should not be viewed in isolation or considered substitutes for Krogers results as reported in accordance with GAAP. Due to the nature of these items, as described below, it is important to identify the items and review them in conjunction with Krogers financial results reported in accordance with GAAP. For the dispute affected regions, we compared actual results to budgeted results from the start of the disputes through the first two quarters of 2004. In establishing budgets for 2004, we took into account trends existing in the market prior to the labor disputes as well as changes in our business plan strategies. Based on those budgets, the estimated effects included the difference between reported sales and sales projections less reported merchandising costs and merchandising cost projections and the difference between reported OG&A and OG&A projections. While we have relied on the accuracy of our budgets, significant amounts of judgment were used to develop those budgets and actual results, had there been no labor disputes, may have differed from those budgets. Included in the estimated effect of labor disputes were charges and credits that were recorded as components of merchandise costs and OG&A expense. The 2003 calculation includes the effect of both the southern California and West Virginia strikes. The estimated effect includes all costs associated with the work stoppages, including expenses under the mutual strike assistance agreement in southern California entered into with Safeway, Inc. and Albertsons, Inc., and post strike recovery expenses through the second quarter of 2004. In the third quarter of 2004, we discontinued reporting the estimated strike effect for southern California. (In millions except per share amounts) 2004 2003 Estimated effect of labor disputes on: FIFO gross margin(1) $ 133 $ 177 OG&A 18 216 Total pre tax loss $ 151 $ 393 Income tax effect (56 ) (148 ) Total after tax loss $ 95 $ 245 Shares 736 754 Estimated loss per share $ 0.13 $ 0.32 (1) FIFO gross margin is defined above in Results of Operations. Differences affecting FIFO gross margin included incremental warehousing, distribution, advertising and inventory shrinkage expenses incurred during the labor dispute, as well as the investment in FIFO gross margin, through targeted price reductions, and advertising in order to regain our sales during the post strike recovery period. Differences in OG&A included costs associated with hiring and training replacement workers, costs associated with bringing in employees from other Kroger divisions to work on a temporary basis, expenses under the mutual strike assistance agreement and costs related to hiring and training workers to replace associates who did not return to work after the labor disputes ended. COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM In December 1999, we began a program to repurchase common stock to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans. This program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises, including the tax benefit from these exercises. We repurchased approximately $28 million, $24 million and $65 million under the stock option program in during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. On December 10, 2002, Krogers Board of Directors (the Board) authorized an additional stock repurchase program totaling $500 million. We made open market purchases totaling $277 million and $63 million under this plan in 2003 and 2002. During fiscal 2004, we made open market purchases of approximately $144 million to complete the program. In September 2004, the Board authorized a new $500 million stock repurchase program to replace the December 2002 program. As of January 29, 2005, we had made purchases totaling $147 million under the September 2004 program. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, totaled $1.6 billion in 2004 compared to $2.0 billion in 2003 and $1.9 billion in 2002. The decline in 2004 was the result of our emphasis on the tightening of capital and increasing our focus on remodels, merchandising and productivity projects. Capital expenditure included $202 million and $192 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, related to the purchase of assets previously financed under a synthetic lease. The table below shows our supermarket storing activity and our total food store square footage: Supermarket Storing Activity 2004 2003 2002 Beginning of year 2,532 2,488 2,418 Opened 41 44 62 Opened (relocation) 15 14 17 Acquired 20 25 37 Acquired (relocation) 3 5 8 Closed (operational) (56 ) (25 ) (29 ) Closed (relocation) (23 ) (19 ) (25 ) End of year 2,532 2,532 2,488 Total food store square footage (in millions) 141 140 136 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position, and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Self Insurance Costs We primarily are self insured for costs related to workers compensation and general liability claims. The liabilities represent our best estimate, using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods, of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through January 29, 2005. Case reserves are established for reported claims using case basis evaluation of the underlying claim data and are updated as information becomes known. The liabilities for workers compensation claims are accounted for on a present value basis utilizing a risk adjusted discount rate. The difference between the discounted and undiscounted workers compensation liabilities was $38 million as of January 29, 2005. We have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis. We are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits. The assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability, which can affect the liability recorded for such claims. For example, variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized. Similarly, changes in legal trends and interpretations, as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can impact ultimate costs. Although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables, any changes could have a considerable effect upon future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities. Impairments of Long Lived Assets In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, we monitor the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger events have occurred. These events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset. When a trigger event occurs, an impairment calculation is performed, comparing projected undiscounted cash flows, utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores, to the carrying value for those stores. If impairment is identified for long lived assets to be held and used, we compare discounted future cash flows to the assets current carrying value. We record impairment when the carrying value exceeds the discounted cash flows. With respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal, the value of the property and equipment is adjusted to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions. Impairment is recognized for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value, reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal. The factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows. Our cash flow projections project several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation, the economy and market competition. We perform impairment reviews at both the division and corporate levels. Generally, for reviews performed by local management, costs to reduce the carrying value of long lived assets are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as Operating, general and administrative expense. Costs to reduce the carrying value of long lived assets that result from corporate level strategic plans are separately identified in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as Asset impairment charges. Refer to Other Items for a description of asset impairment charges recorded during 2003. Goodwill Goodwill is reviewed for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, and also upon the occurrence of trigger events. The reviews are performed at the operating division level. Generally, fair value represents a multiple of earnings, or discounted projected future cash flows, and is compared to the carrying value of a division for purposes of identifying potential impairment. Projected future cash flows are based on managements knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future. If potential for impairment is identified, the fair value of a division is measured against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities, excluding goodwill, to estimate an implied fair value of the divisions goodwill. Goodwill impairment is recognized for any excess of the carrying value of the divisions goodwill over the implied fair value. Results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during 2004, 2003 and 2002 are summarized in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The annual impairment review requires the extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates. Application of alternative assumptions and definitions, such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different organizational level, could produce significantly different results. Similar to our policy on impairment of long lived assets, the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several items such as inflation, the economy and market competition. Intangible Assets In addition to goodwill, the Company has recorded intangible assets totaling $20 million and $29 million for liquor licenses and pharmacy prescription file purchases, respectively, at January 29, 2005. Balances at January 31, 2004, were $20 million for liquor licenses and $21 million for pharmacy prescription files. Owned liquor licenses are not amortized, while liquor licenses that must be renewed are amortized over their useful life. Pharmacy prescription file purchases are amortized over seven years. We test these assets annually for impairment. Store Closing Costs We provide for closed store liabilities relating to the present value of the estimated remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date, net of estimated subtenant income. We estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores. The closed store lease liabilities usually are paid over the lease terms associated with the closed stores, which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to 20 years. Adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates. Adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known. Store closing liabilities are reviewed quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs, or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose, is adjusted to income in the proper period. We estimate subtenant income, future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located, our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions. However, the ultimate cost of the disposition of the leases and the related assets is affected by current real estate markets, inflation rates and general economic conditions. Owned stores held for disposal are reduced to their estimated net realizable value. Costs to reduce the carrying values of property, equipment and leasehold improvements are accounted for in accordance with our policy on impairment of long lived assets. Inventory write downs, if any, in connection with store closings, are classified in Merchandise costs. Costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores are expensed as incurred. Post Retirement Benefit Plans (a) Company Sponsored Pension Plans The determination of our obligation and expense for company sponsored pension plans and other post retirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts. Those assumptions are described in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and include, among others, the discount rate, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs. In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other post retirement obligations and our future expense. Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements discusses the impact of a 1% change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other post retirement benefit costs and the related liability. The discount rate is based primarily on the yield on high quality fixed income investments as of the measurement date. We lowered the discount rate to 5.75% as of January 29, 2005, from 6.25% as of January 31, 2004. The 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate increased the projected pension benefit obligation as of January 29, 2005, by $120 million. In 2005, we expect that the annual pension expense will increase by $15 million as a result of this change. To determine the expected return on pension plan assets, we contemplate current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted returns on various asset categories. For 2004, we assumed a pension return rate of 8.5%, consistent with 2003. Our pension plans average return was 10.9% for the 10 calendar years ended December 31, 2004, net of all investment management fees and expenses. We believe the pension return assumption is appropriate because we do not expect that future returns will achieve the same level of performance as the historical average annual return. In addition to the $35 million we contributed in 2004 and the $100 million we contributed in 2003, we are required to make cash contributions totaling $142 million to our company sponsored pension plan during fiscal 2005. We may make additional contributions during 2005 in order to maintain our desired funding status. We expect any additional contributions during 2005 will decrease our required contributions in future years. Among other things, investment performance of plan assets, the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations, and future changes in legislation, will determine the amounts of any additional contributions. (b) Multi Employer Plans We also contribute to various multi employer pension plans based on obligations arising from most of our collective bargaining agreements. These plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers. The benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose. Trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions. The trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans. We recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded, in accordance with GAAP. We made contributions to these plans, and recognized expense, of $180 million in 2004, $169 million in 2003, and $153 million in 2002. We estimate we would have contributed an additional $2 million in 2004 and $13 million in 2003, but our obligation to contribute was suspended during the labor disputes. Based on the most recent information available to us, we believe that the present value of actuarial accrued liabilities in most or all of these multi employer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits. We have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets, i.e., the amount of underfunding, as of December 31, 2004. Because Kroger is only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans, we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of Krogers contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing Krogers share of the underfunding. As of December 31, 2004, we estimate that Krogers share of the underfunding of multi employer plans to which Kroger contributes was $1.0 to $1.3 billion, pre tax. Our estimate is based on actuarial evaluations and other data (which, itself, includes estimates). Our estimate is imprecise and not necessarily reliable. We have made and disclosed this estimate not because this underfunding is a direct liability of Kroger. Rather, we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences. We expect our contributions to these multi employer plans will continue to increase each year, and therefore the expense we recognize under GAAP will increase. We expect our contributions in 2005 will increase approximately 20 percent, and we expect that amount to increase by about five percent each year thereafter. The amount of increases in 2005 and beyond has been favorably affected by the labor agreements negotiated in southern California and elsewhere during 2004 and by related trustee actions. Although underfunding can result in the imposition of excise taxes on contributing employers, increased contributions can reduce underfunding so that excise taxes are not triggered. Our estimate of future contribution increases takes into account the avoidance of those taxes. Finally, underfunding means that in the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these funds, we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability. Any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated, in accordance with GAAP. The amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and is disclosed for the purpose described. The amount could decline, and Krogers future expense would be favorably affected, if the values of net assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining, trustee action or favorable legislation. On the other hand, Krogers share of the underfunding would increase and Krogers future expense could be adversely affected if net asset values decline, or if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining, trustee action or adverse legislation. Deferred Rent We recognize rent holidays, including the time period during which we have access to the property for construction of buildings or improvements, as well as construction allowances and escalating rent provisions on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. The deferred amount is included in Other Current Liabilities and Other Long Term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Tax Contingencies Various taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions, including state and local taxes, we record allowances for probable exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established an allowance, is audited and fully resolved. As of January 29, 2005, tax years 1999 to 2002 were undergoing examination by the Internal Revenue Service. The establishment of our tax contingency allowances relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. Although management believes those estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results could differ, resulting in gains or losses that may be material to our Consolidated Statements of Operations. To the extent the we prevail in matters for which allowances have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of these allowances, our effective tax rate in any given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement could require use of cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution. Stock Option Plans We apply Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations in accounting for our stock option plans. Accordingly, because the exercise price of the option granted equals the market value of the underlying stock on the option grant date, no stock based compensation expense is included in net earnings, other than expenses related to restricted stock awards. Notes 1 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describe the effect on net earnings if compensation cost for all options had been determined based on the fair market value at the grant date for awards, consistent with the methodology prescribed under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (principally on a LIFO basis) or market. In total, approximately 97% of inventories for 2004 and 2003, respectively, were valued using the LIFO method. Cost for the balance of the inventories was determined using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. Replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by $373 million at January 29, 2005, and by $324 million at January 31, 2004. We follow the Link Chain, Dollar Value LIFO method for purposes of calculating our LIFO charge or credit. The item cost method of accounting to determine inventory cost before the LIFO adjustment is followed for substantially all non perishable store inventories and some perishable departments at our supermarket divisions. This method involves counting each item in inventory, assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs (net of vendor allowances) of each item and recording the actual cost of items sold. The item cost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory and purchasing levels when compared to the methodology followed under the retail method of accounting. We evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities. We record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flow Information Net cash provided by operating activities We generated $2,330 million of cash from operations in 2004 compared to $2,215 million in 2003 and $3,183 million in 2002. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities also affect the net amount of cash provided by our operating activities. During 2004, we realized a $21 million increase in operating assets and liabilities compared to a $255 million increase during 2003 and a $302 million reduction during 2002. Fluctuations in our accounts payable balances and store deposit in transit balances contributed to the changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2003 and 2002. The increase in our store deposits in transit balances in 2003 was primarily related to our decision to discontinue the practice of transferring deposits to our concentration account prior to receiving credit for those deposits from other banks. Offsetting the changes in our store deposits in transit balances, our other current liabilities increased in 2003 as a result of the labor disputes discussed in Estimated Effect of Labor Disputes. In 2002, our accounts payable balances increased substantially due to an enterprise systems conversion that enabled our western divisions to improve their accounts payable position. The amount of cash paid for income taxes in 2004 was higher than the amount paid in 2003 due primarily to higher earnings before the effect of goodwill impairment charges. In addition, the bonus depreciation provision, which expired in December 2004 reduced our cash taxes in 2004, 2003 and 2002, and we expect the cash benefit will reverse in 2005. This provision reduced our cash taxes by approximately $106 million, $130 million and $106 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Our 2004 and 2003 operating cash flow results also reflect cash contributions totaling $35 million and $100 million, respectively, to our company sponsored pension plan. Net cash used by investing activities Cash used by investing activities was $1,608 million in 2004, compared to $2,026 million in 2003 and $1,907 million in 2002. The amount of cash used by investing activities in 2004 decreased from 2003 and 2002 due to reduced capital expenditures. Net cash used by financing activities Financing activities used $737 million of cash in 2004, compared to $201 million in 2003 and $1,266 million in 2002. The increase in cash used by financing in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily related to the amount of cash used to reduce our outstanding debt. The decrease in the use of cash in 2003 versus 2002 was due primarily to a reduction in the amount of cash used to reduce our outstanding debt and to a reduction in treasury stock purchases. The decreased use of cash was also due to increases in book overdrafts in 2003 versus 2002 as well as to proceeds received in 2003 from interest rate swap terminations. Debt Management Total debt, including both the current and long term portions of capital leases, decreased $393 million to $8.0 billion as of year end 2004 from $8.4 billion as of year end 2003. Total debt decreased $210 million to $8.4 billion as of year end 2003 from $8.6 billion as of year end 2002. The decreases were primarily the result of using cash flow from operations to reduce outstanding debt. Approximately $65 million of the decrease experienced in 2003 resulted from the consolidation of a financing entity. Our total debt balances were also affected by our prefunding of employee benefit costs and by the mark to market adjustments necessary to record fair value interest rate hedges of our fixed rate debt, pursuant to SFAS No. 133. We had prefunded employee benefit costs of $300 million at year end 2004, 2003 and 2002. The mark to market adjustments increased the carrying value of our debt by $70 million, $104 million and $110 million as of year end 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Factors Affecting Liquidity We currently borrow on a daily basis approximately $500 million to $600 million under our A2/P2/F2 rated commercial paper (CP) program. These borrowings are backed by our credit facilities, and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facilities. We have capacity available under our credit facilities to backstop all CP amounts outstanding. If our credit rating declined below its current level of BBB/ Baa2/BBB, the ability to borrow under our current CP program could be adversely affected for a period of time immediately following the reduction of our credit rating. This could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facilities, under which we believe we have sufficient capacity. Borrowings under the credit facilities may be more costly than the money we borrow under our current CP program, depending on the current interest rate environment. However, in the event of a ratings decline, we do not anticipate that access to the CP markets currently available to us would be significantly limited for an extended period of time (i.e., in excess of 30 days). Although our ability to borrow under the credit facilities is not affected by our credit rating, the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facilities would be affected by a decrease in our credit rating or a decrease in our Applicable Percentage Ratio. On March 16, 2005, Standard & Poors Ratings Services placed its ratings for Kroger, as well as Safeway Inc. and Albertsons, Inc., on CreditWatch with negative implications. Standard & Poors indicated they expect any downgrade, if warranted by their review, should be limited to one level, with ratings not expected to fall below investment grade. Our credit facilities also require the maintenance of a Leverage Ratio and a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (our financial covenants). A failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facilities. These financial covenants and ratios are described below: Our Applicable Percentage Ratio (the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Total Interest Expense, as defined in the credit facilities) was 5.65 to 1 as of January 29, 2005. If this ratio declined to below 4.75 to 1, the cost of our borrowings under the credit facilities would increase at least 0.125%. The cost of our borrowings under the credit facilities would be similarly impacted by a one level downgrade in our credit rating. Our Leverage Ratio (the ratio of Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the credit facilities) was 2.67 to 1 as of January 29, 2005. If this ratio exceeded 3.50 to 1, we would be in default of our credit facilities and our ability to borrow under these facilities would be impaired. Our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA plus Consolidated Rental Expense to Consolidated Cash Interest Expense plus Consolidated Rental Expense, as defined in the credit facilities) was 3.02 to 1 as of January 29, 2005. If this ratio fell below 1.70 to 1, we would be in default of our credit facilities and our ability to borrow under these facilities would be impaired. Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in our credit facilities, includes an adjustment for unusual gains and losses. Our credit agreements are more particularly described in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We were in compliance with our financial covenants at year end 2004. The tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of January 29, 2005 (in millions of dollars): 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations Long term debt $ 46 $ 554 $ 525 $ 998 $ 1,094 $ 4,288 $ 7,505 Interest on long term debt(1) 466 448 401 324 298 2,134 4,071 Capital lease obligations 62 59 55 53 51 372 652 Operating lease obligations 794 756 682 649 603 4,391 7,875 Charitable contributions 14 14 Minimum contributions to company sponsored pension plan 142 142 Low income housing obligations 49 32 6 2 89 Financed lease obligations 5 5 5 5 5 60 85 Construction commitments 86 86 Purchase obligations 362 60 18 5 1 446 Total $ 2,012 $ 1,928 $ 1,692 $ 2,036 $ 2,052 $ 11,245 $ 20,965 Other Commercial Commitments Credit facilities(2) $ $ $ $ $ 694 $ $ 694 Standby letters of credit 312 312 Surety bonds 128 128 Guarantees 12 12 Total $ 452 $ $ $ $ 694 $ $ 1,146 (1) Amounts include contractual interest payments using the interest rate as of January 29, 2005 applicable to the Companys variable interest debt instruments, excluding commercial paper borrowings due to the short term nature of these borrowings, and stated fixed interest rates for all other debt instruments. (2) These borrowings are currently in the form of short term commercial paper and are also included in the long term debt contractual obligation amount. They are considered long term because the Company expects that these borrowings will be refinanced by the same type of securities. They are scheduled as due in the year of maturity of the existing credit facilities. We are required to make cash contributions totaling $142 million to our company sponsored pension plans during fiscal 2005. We may make additional contributions to these plans in order to maintain our desired funding status. We expect any additional contributions made during 2005 will reduce our minimum required contributions in future years. Among other things, investment performance of plan assets, the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations, and future changes in legislation, will determine the amounts of any additional contributions. At this time, it is not reasonably practicable to estimate contribution amounts for 2006 and beyond. Our construction commitments include funds owed to third parties for projects currently under construction. These amounts are reflected in accounts payable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our purchase obligations include commitments to be utilized in the normal course of business, such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our manufacturing plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and manufacturing facilities. Our obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties. Any upfront vendor allowances or incentives associated with outstanding purchase commitments are recorded as either current or long term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of January 29, 2005, we maintained a five year revolving credit facility totaling $1.8 billion, which terminates in 2009. In addition, we maintained a $700 million five year credit facility that terminates in 2007. Outstanding borrowings under the credit agreements and commercial paper borrowings, and some outstanding letters of credit, reduce funds available under the credit facilities. In addition to the credit facilities, we maintain a $75 million money market line, borrowings under which also reduce the funds available under our credit facilities. As of January 29, 2005, our outstanding credit agreement and commercial paper borrowings totaled $694 million. We had no borrowings under the money market line as of January 29, 2005. The outstanding letters of credit that reduced the funds available under our credit facilities totaled $312 million as of January 29, 2005. We have the ability to refinance these borrowings on a long term basis, and have presented the amounts accordingly. The money market line borrowings allow us to borrow from banks at mutually agreed upon rates, usually at rates below the rates offered under the credit agreements. At January 29, 2005, we also had a $100 million pharmacy receivable securitization facility that provided capacity incremental to the $2.5 billion described above. Funds received under this $100 million facility do not reduce funds available under the credit facilities. Collection rights to some of our pharmacy accounts receivable balances are sold to initiate the drawing of funds under the facility. As of January 29, 2005, we had no borrowings under this $100 million facility. In addition to the available credit mentioned above, as of January 29, 2005, we had available for issuance $1.2 billion of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC and declared effective on December 9, 2004. We also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our self insured insurance costs. These bonds are required by most states in which we are self insured for workers compensation and general liability exposures, and are made with third party insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to make those payments. These bonds do not represent liabilities of Kroger, as we already have liabilities on our books for the insurance costs. However, we do pay annual maintenance fees to have these bonds in place. Market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and, in some instances, availability of these bonds may become more limited, which could affect our costs of or access to such bonds. Although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly impact our ability to access these surety bonds, if this does become an issue, we likely would issue letters of credit against our credit facilities to meet the state bonding requirements. This could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facilities. Most of our outstanding public debt is jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed by The Kroger Co. and some of its subsidiaries. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of those arrangements. In addition, we have guaranteed half of the indebtedness of four real estate joint ventures in which we are a partner with 50% ownership. Our share of the responsibility for this indebtedness, should the partnerships be unable to meet their obligations, totals approximately $12 million. Based on the covenants underlying this indebtedness as of January 29, 2005, it is unlikely that we will be responsible for repayment of these obligations. We also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions. We could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations. Due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties, and various other remedies available to us, we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote. We have agreed to indemnify certain third party logistics operators for certain expenses, including pension trust fund withdrawal liabilities. In addition to the above, the Company enters into various indemnification agreements and takes on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business. Such arrangements include indemnities against third party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to the Company; indemnities related to the sale of Company securities; indemnities of directors, officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work; and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans. While the Companys aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability, the Company is aware of no current matter that it expects to result in a material liability. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In May 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position (FSP) No. 106 2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. FSP No. 106 2 supersedes FSP No. 106 1, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, and provides guidance on the accounting, disclosure and transition related to the Prescription Drug Act. FSP No. 106 2 became effective for the third quarter of 2004. The adoption of FSP No. 106 2 had no material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Detailed regulations in this area continue to evolve that could have an effect on the Company going forward, which effect we do not expect to be material. In December 2004, the FASB issued FSP No. 109 1, Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction of Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which provides accounting and disclosure guidance on the Acts qualified production activities deduction. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its effective tax rate for 2005 and subsequent periods. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R), which replaces SFAS No. 123, supersedes APB No. 25 and related interpretation and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. The provisions of SFAS No. 123R are similar to those of SFAS No. 123; however, SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements as compensation cost based on their fair value on the date of grant. Fair value of share based awards will be determined using option price models (e.g. Black Scholes or binomial models) and assumptions that appropriately reflect the specific circumstances of the awards. Compensation cost will be recognized over the vesting period based on the fair value of awards that actually vest. We expect to adopt SFAS No. 123R in the first quarter of 2006 and expect it will reduce net earnings by $0.04 to $0.05 per diluted share for fiscal 2006. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4 which clarifies that inventory costs that are abnormal are required to be charged to expense as incurred as opposed to being capitalized into inventory as a product cost. SFAS No. 151 provides examples of abnormal costs to included costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs and spoilage. SFAS No. 151 will become effective for our fiscal year beginning January 29, 2006. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 151 to have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. FASB Interpretation No. 47 (FIN 47) Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations was issued by the FASB in March 2005. FIN 47 provides guidance relating to the identification of and financial reporting for legal obligations to perform an asset retirement activity. The Interpretation requires recognition of a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated. FIN 47 is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. We do not expect adoption of FIN 47 to have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. OUTLOOK This discussion and analysis contains certain forward looking statements about Krogers future performance. These statements are based on managements assumptions and beliefs in light of the information available as of April 15, 2005 (the original date of our filing on Form 10 K). Such statements relate to, among other things: projected change in net earnings; identical sales growth; expected pension plan contributions; our ability to generate operating cash flow; projected capital expenditures; square footage growth; opportunities to reduce costs; cash flow requirements; and our operating plan for the future; and are indicated by words such as comfortable, committed, expect, goal, should, intend, target, believe, anticipate, and similar words or phrases. These forward looking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations, projections, beliefs, intentions or strategies are forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21 E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. While we believe that the statements are accurate, uncertainties about the general economy, our labor relations, our ability to execute our plans on a timely basis and other uncertainties described below could cause actual results to differ materially. We expect net earnings in 2005 to exceed $1.21 per diluted share. We expect identical food store sales growth, including southern California and excluding fuel sales, to exceed 2.0% in 2005. We plan to use one third of cash flow for debt reduction and two thirds for stock repurchase or payment of a cash dividend. We expect to obtain sales growth from new square footage, as well as from increased productivity from existing locations. Capital expenditures reflect our strategy of growth through expansion and acquisition, as well as focusing on productivity increase from our existing store base through remodels. In addition, we will continue our emphasis on self development and ownership of real estate, logistics and technology improvements. The continued capital spending in technology is focused on improving store operations, logistics, manufacturing procurement, category management, merchandising and buying practices, and should reduce merchandising costs. We intend to continue using cash flow from operations to finance capital expenditure requirements. We expect capital investment for 2005 to be in the range of $1.6 $1.8 billion, excluding acquisitions. Total food store square footage is expected to grow at 2 3% before acquisitions and operational closings. Based on current operating trends, we believe that cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity, including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facilities, will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, interest payments and scheduled principal payments for the foreseeable future. We also believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to respond effectively to competitive conditions. We expect that our OG&A results will be affected by increased costs, such as health care benefit costs, pension costs and credit card fees, as well as any future labor disputes, offset by improved productivity from process changes, cost savings negotiated in recently completed labor agreements and sales leverage. We expect rent expense, as a percent of total sales and excluding closed store activity, will decrease due to the emphasis our current strategy places on ownership of real estate. We expect that our effective tax rate for 2005 will be approximately 37.5%. We will continue to evaluate under performing stores. We anticipate operational closings will continue at an above historical rate. We believe that in 2005 there will be opportunities to reduce our operating costs in such areas as administration, labor, shrink, warehousing and transportation. These savings will be invested in our core business to drive profitable sales growth and offer improved value and shopping experiences for our customers. In addition to the $35 million and $100 million contributed to Company sponsored pension plans in 2004 and 2003, respectively, we are required to make cash contributions totaling $142 million during fiscal 2005. We may make additional contributions during 2005 in order to maintain our desired funding levels. We expect the additional contributions made during 2005 will reduce our contributions in future years. Among other things, investment performance of plan assets, the interest rates required to be used to calculate pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of any additional contributions. We expect our contributions in 2005 to increase approximately twenty percent over the $180 million contributed in 2004. We expect our contributions to these plans to increase by about five percent each year for each year thereafter. Various uncertainties and other factors could cause us to fail to achieve our goals. These include: In 2005, we have major UFCW contracts expiring in: Atlanta, Columbus. Dallas, Portland (non food), Roanoke. Teamsters contracts in southern California and one that covers several facilities in the Midwest also expire. In all of these contracts, rising health care and pension costs will continue to be an important issue in negotiations. A prolonged work stoppage at a substantial number of stores could have a material effect on our results. Our ability to achieve sales and earnings goals, for the entire Company and southern California in particular, may be affected by: labor disputes; industry consolidation; pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors, including non traditional competitors; our response to these actions; the state of the economy, including the inflationary and deflationary trends in certain commodities; stock repurchases; and the success of our future growth plans. In addition to the factors identified above, our identical store sales growth could be affected by increases in Kroger private label sales, the effect of our sister stores (new stores opened in close proximity to an existing store) and reductions in retail pricing. We have estimated our exposure to the claims and litigation arising in the normal course of business and believe we have made adequate provisions for them where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where we believe an adverse outcome is probable. Unexpected outcomes in these matters, however, could result in an adverse effect on our earnings. The proportion of cash flow used to reduce outstanding debt, repurchase common stock or pay a cash dividend may be affected by the amount of outstanding debt available for pre payments, changes in borrowing rates and the market price of Kroger common stock. Consolidation in the food industry is likely to continue and the effects on our business, either favorable or unfavorable, cannot be foreseen. Rent expense, which includes subtenant rental income, could be adversely affected by the state of the economy, increased store closure activity and future consolidation. Depreciation expense, which includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital leases, is computed principally using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of individual assets, or the remaining terms of leases. Use of the straight line method of depreciation creates a risk that future asset write offs or potential impairment charges related to store closings would be larger than if an accelerated method of depreciation was followed. Our effective tax rate may differ from the expected rate due to changes in laws, the status of pending items with various taxing authorities and the deductibility of certain expenses. We believe the multi employer pension funds to which we contribute are substantially underfunded, and we believe the effect of that underfunding will be the increased contributions we have projected over the next several years. Should asset values in these funds deteriorate, or if employers withdraw from these funds without providing for their share of the liability, or should our estimates prove to be understated, our contributions could increase more rapidly than we have anticipated. The grocery retail industry continues to experience fierce competition from other traditional food retailers, supercenters, mass merchandisers, club or warehouse stores, drug stores and restaurants. Our continued success is dependent upon our ability to compete in this industry and to reduce operating expenses, including managing health care and pension costs contained in our collective bargaining agreements. The competitive environment may cause us to reduce our prices in order to gain or maintain share of sales, thus reducing margins. While we believe our opportunities for sustained profitable growth are considerable, unanticipated actions of competitors could adversely affect our sales. Changes in laws or regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements and environmental laws may have a material effect on our financial statements. Changes in the general business and economic conditions in our operating regions, including the rate of inflation, population growth and employment and job growth in the markets in which we operate, may affect our ability to hire and train qualified employees to operate our stores. This would negatively affect earnings and sales growth. General economic changes may also affect the shopping habits of our customers, which could affect sales and earnings. Changes in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial indicators. For example, we continue to add supermarket fuel centers to our store base. Since gasoline generates low profit margins, including generating decreased margins as the market price increases, we expect to see our FIFO gross profit margins decline as gasoline sales increase. Although this negatively affects our FIFO gross margin, gasoline sales provide a positive effect on operating, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales. Our ability to integrate any companies we acquire or have acquired, and achieve operating improvements at those companies, will affect our operations. Our capital expenditures could differ from our estimate if we are unsuccessful in acquiring suitable sites for new stores, if development costs vary from those budgeted or if our logistics and technology projects are not completed in the time frame expected or on budget. Interest expense could be adversely affected by the interest rate environment, changes in the Companys credit ratings, fluctuations in the amount of outstanding debt, decisions to incur prepayment penalties on the early redemption of debt and any factor that adversely impacts our operations that results in an increase in debt. Adverse weather conditions could increase the cost our suppliers charge for their products, or may decrease the customer demand for certain products. Additionally, increases in the cost of inputs, such as utility costs or raw material costs, could negatively impact financial ratios and earnings. Although we presently operate only in the United States, civil unrest in foreign countries in which our suppliers do business may affect the prices we are charged for imported goods. If we are unable to pass on these increases to our customers, our FIFO gross margin and net earnings will suffer. We cannot fully foresee the effects of changes in economic conditions on Krogers business. We have assumed economic and competitive situations will not change significantly for 2005. Other factors and assumptions not identified above could also cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking information. Accordingly, actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in, contemplated or implied by forward looking statements made by us or our representatives.
