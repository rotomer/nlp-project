ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION. OUR BUSINESS The Kroger Co. was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902. It is one of the nations largest retailers, operating 2,507 stores under two dozen banners including Kroger, Ralphs, Fred Meyer, Food 4 Less, King Soopers, Smiths, Frys, Frys Marketplace, Dillons, QFC and City Market. Of these stores, 579 had fuel centers. The Company also operates 791 convenience stores and 428 fine jewelry stores. Kroger operates 42 manufacturing plants, primarily bakeries and dairies, which supply approximately 55% of the corporate brand units sold in the Companys retail outlets. Our revenues are earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores. We earn income predominately by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of our costs to make these products available to our customers. Such costs include procurement and distribution costs, facility occupancy and operational costs, and overhead expenses. The Companys operations are reported as a single reportable segment: the retail sale of merchandise to individual customers. OUR 2005 PERFORMANCE The continued focus of Krogers associates on delivering improved service, product selection and value to our customers generated a year of significantly improved identical supermarket sales growth in 2005. The 3.5% annual identical food store sales growth, without fuel, achieved in 2005 outpaced the 0.8% identical sales growth achieved on the same basis in 2004, and is a significant improvement over declining identical food store sales experienced in 2003. The fourth quarter growth was broad based and included all retail divisions and store departments. Through the fourth quarter of 2005, we have achieved ten consecutive quarters of positive identical supermarket sales growth, excluding supermarket fuel sales. Our internal analysis shows that we hold the #1 or #2 position in 35 of our 44 major markets. We define a major market as one in which we operate nine or more stores. According to our internal market share estimates, which include all retail outlets including supercenters and other non traditional retail formats, Krogers market share increased in 29 of these 44 markets in 2005, declined in 12 and remained unchanged in three. On a volume weighted basis, Krogers overall market share in these 44 markets increased 35 basis points. Kroger competes in 32 major markets where supercenters have achieved at least a #3 market share position. Krogers overall market share in these 32 markets rose more than 50 basis points during 2005, on a volume weighted basis. Our market share increased in 24 of those markets, declined in seven, and remained unchanged in one. These market share data illustrate that Kroger continues to grow, despite an operating environment in the food retailing industry that continues to be characterized by intense price competition, aggressive supercenter expansion, increasing fragmentation of retail formats, and market consolidation. Krogers retail price investments, combined with our service and selling initiatives led to these market share gains in 2005. We believe this growth can continue. In our 44 major markets, almost 50% of the share in those markets is held by competitors without our economies of scale. Kroger has been able to balance its sales growth with earnings growth. Our net earnings increased to $1.31 per diluted share in 2005, from $1.02 per share, excluding the effect of goodwill impairment charges, in 2004. We were not only able to leverage sales improvements to achieve earnings growth, but also offset investments in targeted retail price reductions and higher energy, credit card and pension costs with continued recovery from the 2003 2004 labor dispute in southern California, as well as improvements in shrink, advertising, warehousing, and health care costs. FUTURE EXPECTATIONS While we were very pleased with our 2005 results, we continue to develop our business model to meet the changing needs and expectations of our customers. Our plan requires balance between sales growth, earnings growth and profitable capital investment. We expect to achieve identical supermarket sales growth through merchandising and operating initiatives that improve the shopping experience and build customer loyalty. We expect 2006 food store identical sales growth, excluding fuel sales, to exceed 3.5%. To the extent that these sales initiatives involve price reductions or additional costs, we expect they will be funded by operating cost reductions and productivity improvements. We expect sales improvements and cost reductions, combined with fewer shares outstanding due to continued share repurchase activity, to drive earnings per share growth in 2006. Kroger expects to deliver earnings per share growth in 2006 of approximately 6% to 8%. This includes the effect of a 53rd week in fiscal 2006, substantially offset by the expected effect of expensing of stock options, which we anticipate will reduce net earnings approximately $0.05 $0.06 per diluted share. See Recently Issued Accounting Standards for additional discussion of the expensing of stock options beginning in 2006. In addition, on March 7, 2006, we announced that Krogers Board of Directors declared the payment of a quarterly dividend of $0.065 per share. The payment will be made June 1, 2006 to holders of record at the close of business on May 15, 2006. Further discussion on our industry, the current economic environment, and our related strategic plans is included in Outlook. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion summarizes our operating results for 2005 compared to 2004 and for 2004 compared to 2003. Comparability is affected by certain income and expense items that fluctuated significantly between and among the periods, including goodwill and asset impairment charges and labor disputes in West Virginia and southern California. Net Earnings (Loss) Net earnings totaled $958 million for 2005, compared to a net loss totaling $104 million in 2004 and net earnings totaling $285 million in 2003. The increase in our net earnings for 2005, compared to 2004 and 2003, resulted from improvements in the southern California market and the leveraging of fixed costs with strong identical supermarket sales growth. In addition, 2004 and 2003 were affected by goodwill and asset impairment charges totaling $904 million and $591 million, respectively, as well as labor disputes in West Virginia and southern California. Earnings per diluted share totaled $1.31 in 2005, compared to a net loss of $0.14 per share in 2004 and earnings of $0.38 per diluted share in 2003. Net earnings were reduced by $1.16 per share in 2004 and $0.78 per diluted share in 2003 due to the effects of goodwill and asset impairment charges. Our earnings per share growth in 2005 resulted from increased net earnings and the repurchase of Kroger stock. During fiscal 2005, we repurchased 15 million shares of Kroger stock for a total investment of $252 million. During fiscal 2004, we repurchased 20 million shares of our stock for a total investment of $319 million. During fiscal 2003, we repurchased 19 million shares of Kroger stock for a total investment of $301 million. Sales Total Sales (in millions) 2005 Percentage Increase 2004 Percentage Increase 2003 Total food store sales without fuel $ 53,472 4.6 % $ 51,106 2.9 % $ 49,650 Total food store fuel sales 3,526 53.0 % 2,305 59.0 % 1,450 Total food store sales $ 56,998 6.7 % $ 53,411 4.5 % $ 51,100 Other sales 3,555 17.6 % 3,023 12.3 % 2,691 Total Sales $ 60,553 7.3 % $ 56,434 4.9 % $ 53,791 Our total sales rose as a result of increased identical supermarket sales and square footage growth, as well as inflation in fuel and other commodities. We define a supermarket as identical when it has been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters. Differences between total supermarket sales and identical supermarket sales primarily relate to changes in supermarket square footage. We calculate annualized identical supermarket sales based on a summation of four quarters of identical supermarket sales. Our identical supermarket sales results are summarized in the table below. Identical Supermarket Sales (in millions) 2005 2004 Including fuel centers $ 54,144 $ 51,413 Excluding fuel centers $ 50,866 $ 49,154 Including fuel centers 5.3 % 2.1 % Excluding fuel centers 3.5 % 0.8 % We define a supermarket as comparable store when it has been in operation for five full quarters, including expansions and relocations. We calculate annualized comparable supermarket sales based on a summation of four quarters of comparable sales. Our annualized comparable supermarket sales results are summarized in the table below. Comparable Supermarket Sales (in millions) 2005 2004 Including supermarket fuel centers $ 55,607 $ 52,514 Excluding supermarket fuel centers $ 52,200 $ 50,226 Including supermarket fuel centers 5.9 % 2.6 % Excluding supermarket fuel centers 3.9 % 1.3 % FIFO Gross Margin We calculate First In, First Out (FIFO) Gross Margin as follows: Sales minus merchandise costs plus Last In, First Out (LIFO) charge (credit). Merchandise costs include advertising, warehousing and transportation, but exclude depreciation expense and rent expense. FIFO gross margin is an important measure used by our management to evaluate merchandising and operational effectiveness. Our FIFO gross margin rates were 24.80%, 25.38% and 26.38% in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Excluding the effect of retail fuel operations, our FIFO gross margin rates were 26.69%, 26.73% and 27.31% in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The growth in our retail fuel sales lowers our FIFO gross margin rate due to the very low FIFO gross margin on retail fuel sales as compared to non fuel sales. The declining rates on our non fuel sales reflect our continued investment in lower retail prices for our customers. In 2005, improvements in shrink, advertising and warehousing costs helped offset higher energy costs and our investments in targeted retail price reductions for our customers. We estimate higher energy costs decreased our FIFO gross margin rate on non fuel sales by 5 basis points in 2005. Operating, General and Administrative Expenses Operating, general and administrative (OG&A) expenses consist primarily of employee related costs such as wages, health care benefit costs and retirement plan costs. Among other items, rent expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and interest expense are not included in OG&A. OG&A expenses, as a percent of sales, were 18.21%, 18.76% and 19.25% in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Excluding the effect of retail fuel operations, our OG&A rates were 19.68%, 19.81% and 19.98% in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The growth in our retail fuel sales lowers our OG&A rate due to the very low OG&A rate on retail fuel sales as compared to non fuel sales. The declining rate on non fuel sales was primarily the result of our continued recovery in southern California, strong identical supermarket sales growth, labor productivity improvements, lower health care costs and $12.9 million of settlement income related to a previous class action credit card lawsuit. These improvements were partially offset by increased pension costs, credit card fees and incentive plan expenses, increases in reserves for certain legal matters, the writedown to fair market value of assets held for sale, and the effects of hurricanes Katrina and Rita. We estimate higher energy costs increased our 2005 OG&A rate on non fuel sales by 7 basis points. Rent Expense Rent expense was $661 million in 2005, as compared to $680 million and $657 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decrease in rent expense reflects our continued emphasis on ownership of real estate. The decline from 2004 was also affected by a decrease in charges for the net present value of lease liabilities recorded for store closings. Depreciation Expense Depreciation expense was $1,265 million, $1,256 million and $1,209 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The slight increase in depreciation expense in 2005 was the result of current capital expenditures of $1.3 billion. Capital expenditures in 2004 and 2003 were $1.6 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. Interest Expense Net interest expense totaled $510 million, $557 million and $604 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decrease in interest expense is the result of lower average borrowings. During 2005, we reduced total debt $739 million from $8.0 billion as of January 29, 2005 to $7.2 billion as of January 28, 2006. Interest expense in 2004 and 2003 included $25 million and $18 million, respectively, related to the early retirement of debt. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 37.2%, 136.4% and 61.4% for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The effective tax rates for 2004 and 2003 differ from the effective tax rate for 2005 due to the impairment of non deductible goodwill in 2004 and 2003. The effective income tax rates also differ from the expected federal statutory rate in all years presented due to the effect of state taxes. COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM We maintain a trading plan under Securities Exchange Act Rule 10b5 1 to allow for our repurchase of Kroger common stock, from time to time, even though we may be aware of material non public information, as long as purchases are made in accordance with the plan. We made open market purchases totaling $239 million, $291 million and $277 million under this repurchase program during fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In addition to this repurchase program, in December 1999 we began a program to repurchase common stock to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans. This program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises, including the tax benefit from these exercises. We repurchased approximately $13 million, $28 million and $24 million under the stock option program during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, totaled $1.3 billion in 2005 compared to $1.6 billion in 2004 and $2.0 billion in 2003. The decline in 2005 and 2004 was the result of our emphasis on the tightening of capital and increasing our focus on remodels, merchandising and productivity projects. Capital expenditures in 2003 included $202 million related to the purchase of assets previously financed under a synthetic lease.

Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Self Insurance Costs We primarily are self insured for costs related to workers compensation and general liability claims. The liabilities represent our best estimate, using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods, of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through January 28, 2006. Case reserves are established for reported claims using case basis evaluation of the underlying claim data and are updated as information becomes known. The liabilities for workers compensation claims are accounted for on a present value basis utilizing a risk adjusted discount rate. The difference between the discounted and undiscounted workers compensation liabilities was $17 million as of January 28, 2006. For both workers compensation and general liability claims, we have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis. We are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits. General liability claims are not discounted. We are also similarly self insured for property related losses. We have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to losses in excess of $10 million on a per claim basis. The assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability, which can affect the liability recorded for such claims. For example, variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized. Similarly, changes in legal trends and interpretations, as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can affect ultimate costs. Although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables, any changes could have a considerable effect upon future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities. Impairments of Long Lived Assets In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, we monitor the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger events have occurred. These events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset. When a trigger event occurs, an impairment calculation is performed, comparing projected undiscounted cash flows, utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores, to the carrying value for those stores. If impairment is identified for long lived assets to be held and used, we compare discounted future cash flows to the assets current carrying value. We record impairment when the carrying value exceeds the discounted cash flows. With respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal, the value of the property and equipment is adjusted to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions. Impairment is recognized for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value, reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal. We perform impairment reviews at both the division and corporate levels. Generally, for reviews performed by local management, costs to reduce the carrying value of long lived assets are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as Operating, general and administrative expense. Costs to reduce the carrying value of long lived assets that result from corporate level strategic plans are separately identified in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as Asset impairment charges. The factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows. Our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation, the economy and market competition. Application of alternative assumptions and definitions, such as reviewing long lived assets for impairment at a different organizational level, could produce significantly different results. Goodwill We review goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, and also upon the occurrence of trigger events. The reviews are performed at the operating division level. Generally, fair value represents a multiple of earnings, or discounted projected future cash flows, and is compared to the carrying value of a division for purposes of identifying potential impairment. Projected future cash flows are based on managements knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future. If potential for impairment is identified, the fair value of a division is measured against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities, excluding goodwill, to estimate an implied fair value of the divisions goodwill. Goodwill impairment is recognized for any excess of the carrying value of the divisions goodwill over the implied fair value. Results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during 2005, 2004 and 2003 are summarized in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The annual impairment review requires the extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates. Application of alternative assumptions and definitions, such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different organizational level, could produce significantly different results. Similar to our policy on impairment of long lived assets, the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several items such as inflation, the economy and market competition. Intangible Assets In addition to goodwill, we have recorded intangible assets totaling $35 million, $20 million and $30 million for leasehold equities, liquor licenses and pharmacy prescription file purchases, respectively, at January 28, 2006. Balances at January 29, 2005, were $40 million, $20 million and $29 million for lease equities, liquor licenses and pharmacy prescription files, respectively. Leasehold equities are amortized over the remaining life of the lease. Owned liquor licenses are not amortized, while liquor licenses that must be renewed are amortized over their useful lives. Pharmacy prescription file purchases are amortized over seven years. These assets are considered annually during our testing for impairment. Store Closing Costs We provide for closed store liabilities relating to the present value of the estimated remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date, net of estimated subtenant income. We estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores. The closed store lease liabilities usually are paid over the lease terms associated with the closed stores, which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to 20 years. Adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates. Adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known. Store closing liabilities are reviewed quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs, or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose, is adjusted to income in the proper period. We estimate subtenant income, future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located, our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions. However, the ultimate cost of the disposition of the leases and the related assets is affected by current real estate markets, inflation rates and general economic conditions. Owned stores held for disposal are reduced to their estimated net realizable value. Costs to reduce the carrying values of property, equipment and leasehold improvements are accounted for in accordance with our policy on impairment of long lived assets. Inventory write downs, if any, in connection with store closings, are classified in Merchandise costs. Costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores are expensed as incurred. Post Retirement Benefit Plans (a) Company sponsored Pension Plans The determination of our obligation and expense for Company sponsored pension plans and other post retirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts. Those assumptions are described in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and include, among others, the discount rate, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, average life expectancy and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs. In accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions, including the discount rate used and the expected return on plan assets, may materially affect our pension and other post retirement obligations and our future expense. Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements discusses the effect of a 1% change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other post retirement benefit costs and the related liability. The objective of our discount rate assumption was to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. In making this determination, we took into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plan. Our methodology for selecting the discount rate as of year end 2005 was to match the plans cash flows to that of a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zero coupon corporate bonds for each maturity. Benefit cash flows due in a particular year can be settled theoretically by investing them in the zero coupon bond that matures in the same year. The discount rate is the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows. The selection of the 5.70% discount rate as of year end 2005 represents the equivalent single rate under a broad market AA yield curve constructed by our outside consultant, Mercer Human Resource Consulting. We utilized a discount rate of 5.75% for year end 2004. The 5 basis point reduction in the discount rate increased the projected pension benefit obligation as of January 28, 2006, by approximately $12 million. To determine the expected return on pension plan assets, we consider current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted returns on various asset categories. For 2005, we assumed a pension plan investment return rate of 8.5%, consistent with 2004. Our pension plans average return was 9.6% for the 10 calendar years ended December 31, 2005, net of all investment management fees and expenses. Our actual return for the pension plan calendar year ending December 31, 2005, on that same basis, was 10.3%. We believe the pension return assumption is appropriate because we do not expect that future returns will achieve the same level of performance as the historical average annual return. We have been advised that during 2006 and 2007, the trustees plan to reduce from 61% to 42% the allocation of pension plan assets to domestic and international equities and increase from 12% to 30% the allocation to non core assets, including inflation linked bonds, commodities, hedge funds and real estate. Furthermore, in order to augment the return on domestic equities and investment grade debt securities during 2006 and 2007, the trustees plan to increase hedge funds within these sectors from 3% to 15%. Collectively, these changes should improve the diversification of pension plan assets. The trustees expect these changes to have little effect on the total return but will reduce the expected volatility of the return. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the asset allocations of pension plan assets. Sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions used in the calculation of Krogers pension plan liabilities for the Qualified Plans is illustrated below (in millions). Percentage Point Change Projected Benefit Obligation Decrease/(Increase) Expense Decrease/(Increase) Discount Rate +/ 1.0 % $ 277/($315 ) $ 27/($33 ) Expected Return on Assets +/ 1.0 % $ 15/($15 ) In 2005, we updated the mortality table used to determine average life expectancy in the calculation of our pension obligation to the RP 2000 Projected to 2015 mortality table. The change in this assumption increased our projected benefit obligation approximately $93 million and is reflected in unrecognized actuarial (gain) loss as of the measurement date. We contributed $300 million, $35 million and $100 million to our Company sponsored pension plans in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Although we are not required to make cash contributions to our Company sponsored pension plans during fiscal 2006, we made a $150 million cash contribution to our qualified pension plans on March 27, 2006. Additional contributions may be made if our cash flows from operations exceed our expectations. We expect any elective contributions made during 2006 will decrease our required contributions in future years. Among other things, investment performance of plan assets, the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations, and future changes in legislation, will determine the amounts of any additional contributions. (b) Multi Employer Plans We also contribute to various multi employer pension plans based on obligations arising from most of our collective bargaining agreements. These plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers. The benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose. Trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions. The trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans. We recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded, in accordance with GAAP. We made contributions to these plans, and recognized expense, of $196 million in 2005, $180 million in 2004, and $169 million in 2003. We estimate we would have contributed an additional $2 million in 2004 and $13 million in 2003, but our obligation to contribute was suspended during the southern California and West Virginia labor disputes. Based on the most recent information available to us, we believe that the present value of actuarial accrued liabilities in most or all of these multi employer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits. We have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets, i.e., the amount of underfunding, as of December 31, 2005. Because Kroger is only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans, we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of Krogers contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing Krogers share of the underfunding. As of December 31, 2005, we estimate that Krogers share of the underfunding of multi employer plans to which Kroger contributes was $1.0 to $1.3 billion, pre tax, or $625 million to $813 million, after tax. This is consistent with the amount of underfunding estimated as of December 31, 2004. Our estimate is based on the best information available to us including actuarial evaluations and other data (that include the estimates of others), and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable. Our estimate is imprecise and not necessarily reliable. We have made and disclosed this estimate not because this underfunding is a direct liability of Kroger. Rather, we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences. We expect our contributions to these multi employer plans will continue to increase each year, and therefore the expense we recognize under GAAP will increase. In 2005, our contributions to these plans increased approximately 9% over the prior year. We expect our contributions to increase by approximately five percent in 2006 and each year thereafter. The amount of increases in 2006 and beyond has been favorably affected by the labor agreements negotiated in southern California and elsewhere during 2005 and 2004, as well as by related trustee actions. Although underfunding can result in the imposition of excise taxes on contributing employers, increased contributions can reduce underfunding so that excise taxes are not triggered. Our estimate of future contribution increases takes into account the avoidance of those taxes. Finally, underfunding means that, in the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these funds, we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability. Any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated, in accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions. The amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and is disclosed for the purpose described. The amount could decline, and Krogers future expense would be favorably affected, if the values of net assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining, trustee action or favorable legislation. On the other hand, Krogers share of the underfunding would increase and Krogers future expense could be adversely affected if net asset values decline, if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining, trustee action or adverse legislation. Deferred Rent We recognize rent holidays, including the time period during which we have access to the property for construction of buildings or improvements, as well as construction allowances and escalating rent provisions on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. The deferred amount is included in Other Current Liabilities and Other Long Term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Tax Contingencies Various taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions, including state and local taxes, we record allowances for probable exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established an allowance, is audited and fully resolved. As of January 28, 2006, tax years 2002 through 2004 were undergoing examination by the Internal Revenue Service. The establishment of our tax contingency allowances relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. Although management believes those estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results could differ, resulting in gains or losses that may be material to our Consolidated Statements of Operations. To the extent that we prevail in matters for which allowances have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of these allowances, our effective tax rate in any given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement could require use of cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution. Stock Option Plans We apply Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations in accounting for our stock option plans. Accordingly, because the exercise price of the option granted equals the market value of the underlying stock on the option grant date, no stock based compensation expense is included in net earnings, other than expenses related to restricted stock awards. Notes 1 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describe the effect on net earnings if compensation cost for all options had been determined based on the fair market value at the grant date for awards, consistent with the methodology prescribed under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R), which replaces SFAS No. 123, supersedes APB No. 25 and related interpretations and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. The provisions of SFAS No. 123R are similar to those of SFAS No. 123; however, SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements as compensation cost based on their fair value on the date of grant. Fair value of share based awards will be determined using option pricing models (e.g., Black Scholes or binomial models) and assumptions that appropriately reflect the specific circumstances of the awards. Compensation cost will be recognized over the vesting period based on the fair value of awards that actually vest. We expect to adopt SFAS No. the adoption of SFAS No. 123R to reduce net earnings by $0.05 $0.06 per diluted share during fiscal 2006. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (principally on a LIFO basis) or market. In total, approximately 98% of inventories for 2005 and 2004, respectively, were valued using the LIFO method. Cost for the balance of the inventories was determined using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. Replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by $400 million at January 28, 2006, and by $373 million at January 29, 2005. We follow the Link Chain, Dollar Value LIFO method for purposes of calculating our LIFO charge or credit. The item cost method of accounting to determine inventory cost before the LIFO adjustment is followed for substantially all store inventories at our supermarket divisions. This method involves counting each item in inventory, assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs (net of vendor allowances and cash discounts) of each item and recording the actual cost of items sold. The item cost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory and purchasing levels when compared to the methodology followed under the retail method of accounting. We evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities. We record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date. Vendor Allowances We recognize all vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs when the related product is sold. In most cases, vendor allowances are applied to the related product by item, and therefore reduce the carrying value of inventory by item. When it is not practicable to allocate vendor allowances to the product by item, vendor allowances are recognized as a reduction in merchandise costs based on inventory turns and recognized as the product is sold. In fiscal 2005 and 2004, we recognized approximately $3.2 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, of vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs. More than 80% of all vendor allowances were recognized in the item cost with the remainder being based on inventory turns. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flow Information Net cash provided by operating activities We generated $2,192 million of cash from operations in 2005 compared to $2,330 million in 2004 and $2,215 million in 2003. In addition to changes in net earnings, changes in our operating assets and liabilities also affect the amount of cash provided by our operating activities. During 2005, we realized a $128 million increase in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities, compared to a $103 and $247 million decrease during 2004 and 2003, respectively. These amounts are net of cash contributions to our Company sponsored pension plan totaling $300 million in 2005, $35 million in 2004 and $100 million in 2003. The amount of cash paid for income taxes in 2005 was higher than the amounts paid in 2004 and 2003 due to higher net earnings. In addition, the bonus depreciation provision, which expired in December 2004, reduced our cash taxes in 2004 and 2003. This benefit reversed in 2005. This provision increased our cash taxes by approximately $108 million in 2005 and reduced our cash taxes by approximately $90 million and $122 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Net cash used by investing activities Cash used by investing activities was $1,279 million in 2005, compared to $1,608 million in 2004 and $2,026 million in 2003. The amount of cash used by investing activities decreased in 2005 and 2004 due to reduced capital expenditures. Refer to the Capital Expenditures section for an overview of our supermarket storing activity during the last three years. Net cash used by financing activities Financing activities used $847 million of cash in 2005 compared to $737 million in 2004 and $201 million in 2003. The increase in cash used by financing in 2005 was due to a decrease in long term debt issuances. The increases in 2005 and 2004 over 2003 are primarily due to the amount of cash used to reduce our outstanding debt. Debt Management Total debt, including both the current and long term portions of capital leases and financing obligations, decreased $739 million to $7.2 billion as of year end 2005 from $8.0 billion as of year end 2004. Total debt decreased $393 million to $8.0 billion as of year end 2004 from $8.4 billion as of year end 2003. The decreases were primarily the result of using cash flow from operations to reduce outstanding debt. Our total debt balances were also affected by our prefunding of employee benefit costs and by the mark to market adjustments necessary to record fair value interest rate hedges of our fixed rate debt, pursuant to SFAS No. 133. We had prefunded employee benefit costs of $300 million at year end 2005, 2004 and 2003. The mark to market adjustments increased the carrying value of our debt by $27 million, $70 million and $104 million as of year end 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Factors Affecting Liquidity We currently borrow on a daily basis approximately $15 million under our F2/P2/A3 rated commercial paper (CP) program. These borrowings are backed by our credit facilities, and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facilities. We have capacity available under our credit facilities to backstop all CP amounts outstanding. If our credit rating declined below its current level of BBB/ Baa2/BBB , the ability to borrow under our current CP program could be adversely affected for a period of time immediately following the reduction of our credit rating. This could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facilities, under which we believe we have sufficient capacity. Borrowings under the credit facilities may be more costly than the money we borrow under our current CP program, depending on the current interest rate environment. However, in the event of a ratings decline, we do not anticipate that access to the CP markets currently available to us would be significantly limited for an extended period of time (i.e., in excess of 30 days). Although our ability to borrow under the credit facilities is not affected by our credit rating, the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facilities would be affected by a decrease in our credit rating or a decrease in our Applicable Percentage Ratio. Our credit facilities also require the maintenance of a Leverage Ratio and a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (our financial covenants). A failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facilities. These financial covenants and ratios are described below: Our Applicable Percentage Ratio (the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Total Interest Expense, as defined in the credit facilities) was 6.70 to 1 as of January 28, 2006. If this ratio declined to below 4.75 to 1, the cost of our borrowings under the credit facilities would increase at least 0.13%. The cost of our borrowings under the credit facilities would be similarly affected by a one level downgrade in our credit rating. Our Leverage Ratio (the ratio of Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the credit facilities) was 2.23 to 1 as of January 28, 2006. If this ratio exceeded 3.50 to 1, we would be in default of our credit facilities and our ability to borrow under these facilities would be impaired. Our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA plus Consolidated Rental Expense to Consolidated Cash Interest Expense plus Consolidated Rental Expense, as defined in the credit facilities) was 3.38 to 1 as of January 28, 2006. If this ratio fell below 1.70 to 1, we would be in default of our credit facilities and our ability to borrow under these facilities would be impaired. Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in our credit facilities, includes an adjustment for unusual gains and losses. Our credit agreements are more particularly described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We were in compliance with our financial covenants at year end 2005. The tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments, based on year of maturity or settlement, as of January 28, 2006 (in millions of dollars): 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations Long term debt $ 527 $ 527 $ 1,000 $ 912 $ 42 $ 3,739 $ 6,747 Interest on long term debt(1) 480 423 329 303 250 1,922 3,707 Capital lease obligations 61 57 54 52 51 344 619 Operating lease obligations 784 732 684 635 588 4,075 7,498 Charitable contributions 14 14 Minimum contributions to Company sponsored pension plans Low income housing obligations 47 6 2 55 Financed lease obligations 11 11 11 11 11 159 214 Construction commitments 95 95 Purchase obligations 362 60 18 5 1 446 Total $ 2,381 $ 1,816 $ 2,098 $ 1,918 $ 943 $ 10,239 $ 19,395 Other Commercial Commitments Credit facilities $ $ $ $ $ $ $ Standby letters of credit 314 314 Surety bonds 106 106 Guarantees 11 11 Total $ 431 $ $ $ $ $ $ 431 (1) Amounts include contractual interest payments using the interest rate as of January 28, 2006 applicable to Krogers variable interest debt instruments, excluding commercial paper borrowings due to the short term nature of these borrowings, and stated fixed interest rates for all other debt instruments. Although we are not required to make cash contributions to our Company sponsored pension plans during fiscal 2006, we made a $150 million cash contribution to our qualified pension plans on March 27, 2006. Additional contributions may be made if our cash flows from operations exceed our expectations. We expect any elective contributions made during 2006 will reduce our minimum required contributions in future years. Among other things, investment performance of plan assets, the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations, and future changes in legislation, will determine the amounts of any additional contributions. At this time, it is not reasonably practicable to estimate contribution amounts for 2007 and beyond. Our construction commitments include funds owed to third parties for projects currently under construction. These amounts are reflected in other current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our purchase obligations include commitments to be utilized in the normal course of business, such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our manufacturing plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and manufacturing facilities. Our obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties. Any upfront vendor allowances or incentives associated with outstanding purchase commitments are recorded as either current or long term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of January 28, 2006, we maintained a five year revolving credit facility totaling $1.8 billion, which terminates in 2010. In addition, we maintained a $700 million five year credit facility that terminates in 2007. Outstanding borrowings under the credit agreements and commercial paper borrowings, and some outstanding letters of credit, reduce funds available under the credit facilities. In addition to the credit facilities, we maintain a $50 million money market line, borrowings under which also reduce the funds available under our credit facilities. The money market line borrowings allow us to borrow from banks at mutually agreed upon rates, usually at rates below the rates offered under the credit agreements. As of January 28, 2006, we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit agreements and commercial paper program. We had no borrowings under the money market line as of January 28, 2006. The outstanding letters of credit that reduced the funds available under our credit facilities totaled $303 million as of January 28, 2006. In addition to the available credit mentioned above, as of January 28, 2006, we had available for issuance $1.2 billion of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC and declared effective on December 9, 2004. We also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our self insured insurance costs. These bonds are required by most states in which we are self insured for workers compensation and general liability exposures, and are made with third party insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to make those payments. These bonds do not represent liabilities of Kroger, as we already have liabilities on our books for the insurance costs. However, we do pay annual maintenance fees to have these bonds in place. Market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and, in some instances, availability of these bonds may become more limited, which could affect our costs of or access to such bonds. Although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly effect our ability to access these surety bonds, if this does become an issue, we likely would issue letters of credit against our credit facilities to meet the state bonding requirements. This could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facilities. Most of our outstanding public debt is jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed by The Kroger Co. and some of its subsidiaries. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of those arrangements. In addition, we have guaranteed half of the indebtedness of three real estate joint ventures in which we are a partner with 50% ownership. Our share of the responsibility for this indebtedness, should the partnerships be unable to meet their obligations, totals approximately $11 million. Based on the covenants underlying this indebtedness as of January 28, 2006, it is unlikely that we will be responsible for repayment of these obligations. We also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions. We could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations. Due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties, and various other remedies available to us, we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote. We have agreed to indemnify certain third party logistics operators for certain expenses, including pension trust fund withdrawal liabilities. In addition to the above, we enter into various indemnification agreements and take on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business. Such arrangements include indemnities against third party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to Kroger; indemnities related to the sale of our securities; indemnities of directors, officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work; and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans. While Krogers aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability, we are aware of no current matter that we expect to result in a material liability RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R), which replaces SFAS No. 123, supersedes APB No. 25 and related interpretations and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. The provisions of SFAS No. 123R are similar to those of SFAS No. 123; however, SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements as compensation cost based on their fair value on the date of grant. Fair value of share based awards will be determined using option pricing models (e.g. Black Scholes or binomial models) and assumptions that appropriately reflect the specific circumstances of the awards. Compensation cost will be recognized over the vesting period based on the fair value of awards that actually vest. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we are accounting for share based compensation expense under the recognition and measurement provisions of APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and are following the accepted practice of recognizing share based compensation expense over the explicit vesting period. SFAS No. 123R will require the immediate recognition at the grant date of the full share based compensation expense for grants to retirement eligible employees, as the explicit vesting period is non substantive. We expect to adopt SFAS No. 123R in the first quarter of 2006. We expect the adoption of SFAS No. 123R to reduce net earnings by $0.05 $0.06 per diluted share during fiscal 2006. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, which clarifies that inventory costs that are abnormal are required to be charged to expense as incurred as opposed to being capitalized into inventory as a product cost. SFAS No. 151 provides examples of abnormal costs to include costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs and spoilage. SFAS No. 151 will become effective for our fiscal year beginning January 29, 2006. The adoption of SFAS No. 151 is not expected to have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS No. 154 also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change. Indirect effects of a change in accounting principle should be recognized in the period of the accounting change. SFAS No. 154 further requires a change in depreciation, amortization or depletion method for long lived, non financial assets to be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 will become effective for our fiscal year beginning January 29, 2006. FASB Interpretation No. 47 (FIN 47) Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations was issued by the FASB in March 2005. FIN 47 provides guidance relating to the identification of and financial reporting for legal obligations to perform an asset retirement activity. The Interpretation requires recognition of a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated. FIN 47 became effective during fiscal 2005. The adoption of FIN 47 did not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In November 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 04 10, Determining Whether to Aggregate Operating Segments That Do No Meet the Quantitative Thresholds. EITF No. 04 10 concludes that operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds can be aggregated only if aggregation is consistent with the objectives and basic principles of SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, the segments have similar economic characteristics, and the segments share a majority of the aggregation criteria listed in (a) (e) of paragraph 17 of SFAS No. 131. EITF No. 04 10 became effective for fiscal years ending after September 15, 2005, and did not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In June 2005, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 05 6, Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements Purchased After Lease Inception or Acquired in a Business Combination. EITF No. 05 6 requires that leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewal periods deemed to be reasonably assured at the date of acquisition. EITF No. 05 6 further requires that leasehold improvements that are placed into service significantly after, and not contemplated at or near the beginning of the lease term, shall be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes the required lease periods and any renewal periods deemed to be reasonably assured at the date of acquisition. EITF No. 05 6 became effective for our second fiscal quarter beginning August 14, 2005. The adoption of EITF No. 05 6 did not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In October 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS 13 1, Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred during a Construction Period. FSP FAS 13 1 requires rental costs associated with building or ground leases incurred during a construction period to be recognized as rental expense. In addition, FSP FAS 13 1 requires lessees to cease capitalizing rental costs, as of December 15, 2005, for operating lease agreements entered into prior to December 15, 2005. Early adoption is permitted. The Company was already in compliance with the provisions of FSP FAS 13 1, therefore it had no effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. OUTLOOK This discussion and analysis contains certain forward looking statements about Krogers future performance. These statements are based on managements assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available. Such statements relate to, among other things: projected change in net earnings; identical sales growth; expected pension plan contributions; our ability to generate operating cash flow; projected capital expenditures; square footage growth; opportunities to reduce costs; cash flow requirements; and our operating plan for the future; and are indicated by words such as comfortable, committed, will, expect, goal, should, intend, target, believe, anticipate, and similar words or phrases. These forward looking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors t hat could cause actual results to differ materially. Statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations, projections, beliefs, intentions or strategies are forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21 E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. While we believe that the statements are accurate, uncertainties about the general economy, our labor relations, our ability to execute our plans on a timely basis and other uncertainties described below could cause actual results to differ materially. We expect earnings per share growth of approximately 6% 8% in 2006. This includes the effect of a 53rd week in fiscal 2006, which will be substantially offset by the expensing of stock options. We anticipate the expensing of stock options will reduce net earnings approximately $0.05 $0.06 per diluted share. We also expect 2007 earnings per share growth to be approximately 6% 8%, based on comparable 52 week results for 2006. We expect identical food store sales growth, excluding fuel sales, to exceed 3.5% in 2006. In fiscal 2006, we will continue to focus on driving sales growth and balancing investments in gross margin and improved customer service with operating cost reductions to provide a better shopping experience for our customers. We expect operating margins in southern California to improve slightly due to the continued recovery in that market, although we expect improvement in 2006 will be less than in 2005. We expect operating margins, excluding the effect of fuel sales, to hold steady in the balance of the Company. We plan to use, over the long term, one third of cash flow for debt reduction and two thirds for stock repurchase or payment of a cash dividend. We expect to obtain sales growth from new square footage, as well as from increased productivity from existing locations. Capital expenditures reflect our strategy of growth through expansion and acquisition, as well as focusing on productivity increase from our existing store base through remodels. In addition, we will continue our emphasis on self development and ownership of real estate, logistics and technology improvements. The continued capital spending in technology is focused on improving store operations, logistics, manufacturing procurement, category management, merchandising and buying practices, and should reduce merchandising costs. We intend to continue using cash flow from operations to finance capital expenditure requirements. We expect capital investment for 2006 to be in the range of $1.7 $1.9 billion, excluding acquisitions. Total food store square footage is expected to grow 1.5% 2% before acquisitions and operational closings. Based on current operating trends, we believe that cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity, including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facilities, will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, interest payments and scheduled principal payments for the foreseeable future. We also believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to respond effectively to competitive conditions. We expect that our OG&A results will be affected by increased costs, such as higher energy costs, pension costs and credit card fees, as well as any future labor disputes, offset by improved productivity from process changes, cost savings negotiated in recently completed labor agreements and leverage gained through sales increases. We expect that our effective tax rate for 2006 will be approximately 37.5%. We will continue to evaluate under performing stores. We anticipate operational closings will continue at an above historical rate. We expect rent expense, as a percent of total sales and excluding closed store activity, will decrease due to the emphasis our current strategy places on ownership of real estate. We believe that in 2006 there will be opportunities to reduce our operating costs in such areas as administration, labor, shrink, warehousing and transportation. These savings will be invested in our core business to drive profitable sales growth and offer improved value and shopping experiences for our customers. Although we are not required to make cash contributions during fiscal 2006, we made a $150 million cash contribution to our qualified pension plans on March 27, 2006. Additional contributions may be made if our cash flows from operations exceed our expectations. We expect any elective contributions made during 2006 will reduce our contributions in future years. Among other things, investment performance of plan assets, the interest rates required to be used to calculate pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of any additional contributions. We expect our contributions to multi employer pension plans to increase at 5% per year over the $196 million we contributed during 2005. Various uncertainties and other factors could cause us to fail to achieve our goals. These include: We have various labor agreements expiring in 2006, covering smaller groups of associates than those contracts negotiated in 2005. In all of these contracts, rising health care and pension costs will continue to be an important issue in negotiations. A prolonged work stoppage at a substantial number of stores could have a material effect on our results. Our ability to achieve sales and earnings goals may be affected by: labor disputes; industry consolidation; pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors, including non traditional competitors; our response to these actions; the state of the economy, including the inflationary and deflationary trends in certain commodities; stock repurchases; and the success of our future growth plans. In addition to the factors identified above, our identical store sales growth could be affected by increases in Kroger private label sales, the effect of our sister stores (new stores opened in close proximity to an existing store) and reductions in retail pricing. Our operating margins could fail to improve if our operations in southern California do not improve as expected or if we are unsuccessful at containing our operating costs. We have estimated our exposure to the claims and litigation arising in the normal course of business, as well as in material litigation facing the Company, and believe we have made adequate provisions for them where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where we believe an adverse outcome is probable. Unexpected outcomes in these matters, however, could result in an adverse effect on our earnings. The proportion of cash flow used to reduce outstanding debt, repurchase common stock or pay a cash dividend may be affected by the amount of outstanding debt available for pre payments, changes in borrowing rates and the market price of Kroger common stock. Consolidation in the food industry is likely to continue and the effects on our business, either favorable or unfavorable, cannot be foreseen. Rent expense, which includes subtenant rental income, could be adversely affected by the state of the economy, increased store closure activity and future consolidation. Depreciation expense, which includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital leases, is computed principally using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of individual assets, or the remaining terms of leases. Use of the straight line method of depreciation creates a risk that future asset write offs or potential impairment charges related to store closings would be larger than if an accelerated method of depreciation was followed. Our effective tax rate may differ from the expected rate due to changes in laws, the status of pending items with various taxing authorities and the deductibility of certain expenses. We believe the multi employer pension funds to which we contribute are substantially underfunded, and we believe the effect of that underfunding will be the increased contributions we have projected over the next several years. Should asset values in these funds deteriorate, or if employers withdraw from these funds without providing for their share of the liability, or should our estimates prove to be understated, our contributions could increase more rapidly than we have anticipated. The grocery retail industry continues to experience fierce competition from other traditional food retailers, supercenters, mass merchandisers, club or warehouse stores, drug stores and restaurants. Our continued success is dependent upon our ability to compete in this industry and to reduce operating expenses, including managing health care and pension costs contained in our collective bargaining agreements. The competitive environment may cause us to reduce our prices in order to gain or maintain share of sales, thus reducing margins. While we believe our opportunities for sustained profitable growth are considerable, unanticipated actions of competitors could adversely affect our sales. Changes in laws or regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements and environmental laws may have a material effect on our financial statements. Changes in the general business and economic conditions in our operating regions, including the rate of inflation, population growth and employment and job growth in the markets in which we operate, may affect our ability to hire and train qualified employees to operate our stores. This would negatively affect earnings and sales growth. General economic changes may also affect the shopping habits of our customers, which could affect sales and earnings. Changes in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial indicators. For example, we continue to add supermarket fuel centers to our store base. Since gasoline generates low profit margins, including generating decreased margins as the market price increases, we expect to see our FIFO gross profit margins decline as gasoline sales increase. Although this negatively affects our FIFO gross margin, gasoline sales provide a positive effect on operating, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales. Our ability to integrate any companies we acquire or have acquired, and achieve operating improvements at those companies, will affect our operations. Our capital expenditures could differ from our estimate if we are unsuccessful in acquiring suitable sites for new stores, if development costs vary from those budgeted or if our logistics and technology projects are not completed in the time frame expected or on budget. Our expected square footage growth and the number of store projects completed during the year are dependent upon our ability to acquire desirable sites for construction of new facilities as well as the timing and completion of projects. Interest expense could be adversely affected by the interest rate environment, changes in the Companys credit ratings, fluctuations in the amount of outstanding debt, decisions to incur prepayment penalties on the early redemption of debt and any factor that adversely affects our operations that results in an increase in debt. Our estimated expense of $0.05 $0.06 per diluted share, from the adoption of SFAS No. 123 R, requiring the expensing of stock options, could vary if the assumptions that were used to calculate the expense prove to be inaccurate or are changed. The amount we contribute to Company sponsored pension plans could vary if the amount of cash flow that we generate differs from that expected. Adverse weather conditions could increase the cost our suppliers charge for their products, or may decrease the customer demand for certain products. Additionally, increases in the cost of inputs, such as utility costs or raw material costs, could negatively affect financial ratios and earnings. Although we presently operate only in the United States, civil unrest in foreign countries in which our suppliers do business may affect the prices we are charged for imported goods. If we are unable to pass on these increases to our customers, our FIFO gross margin and net earnings will suffer. We cannot fully foresee the effects of changes in economic conditions on Krogers business. We have assumed economic and competitive situations will not change significantly for 2006. Other factors and assumptions not identified above could also cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking information.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Financial Risk Management We use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. As a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure. Because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure, fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure. The interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets. We manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of variable and fixed rate debt, and interest rate swaps. Our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates both fixing the rates on variable rate debt and hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. To do this, we use the following guidelines: (i) use average daily bank balance to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure, (ii) limit the annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of $2.5 billion or less, (iii) include no leveraged products, and (iv) hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current mark to market status. As of January 28, 2006, we maintained ten interest rate swap agreements, with notional amounts totaling approximately $1,375 million, to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates. These agreements mature at varying times between July 2006 and January 2015. Variable rates for our agreements are based on U.S. dollar London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements and is recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense. These interest rate swap agreements are being accounted for as fair value hedges. As of January 28, 2006, other long term liabilities totaling $34 million were recorded to reflect the fair value of these agreements, offset by decreases in the fair value of the underlying debt. In addition, as of January 28, 2006, we maintained three forward starting interest rate swap agreements, with notional amounts totaling $750 million, to manage our exposure to changes in future benchmark interest rates. A forward starting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges future benchmark interest rates, including general corporate spreads, on debt for an established period of time. We entered into the forward starting interest rate swaps in order to lock in fixed interest rates on our forecasted issuance of debt in fiscal 2007 and 2008. Accordingly, these instruments have been designated as cash flow hedges for our forecasted debt issuances. Two of these swaps have ten year terms, with the remaining swap having a twelve year term, beginning with the issuance of the debt. The average fixed rate for these instruments is 5.14%, and the variable rate will be determined at the inception date of the swap. As of January 28, 2006, we had recorded other long term liabilities totaling $2 million to reflect the fair value of these agreements. During 2003, we terminated six interest rate swap agreements that were accounted for as fair value hedges. Approximately $114 million of proceeds received as a result of these terminations were recorded as adjustments to the carrying values of the underlying debt and are being amortized over the remaining lives of the debt. As of January 28, 2006, the unamortized balances totaled approximately $63 million. Annually, we review with the Financial Policy Committee of our Board of Directors compliance with the guidelines. The guidelines may change as our business needs dictate. The tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives and underlying debt portfolio as of January 28, 2006. The amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of long term debt, excluding capital leases, and the average outstanding notional amounts of interest rate derivatives as of January 28, 2006. Interest rates reflect the weighted average for the outstanding instruments. The variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on U.S. dollar LIBOR using the forward yield curve as of January 28, 2006. The Fair Value column includes the fair value of our debt instruments and interest rate derivatives as of January 28, 2006.

We enter into commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of normal business. Those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in the normal course of business qualify as normal purchases and normal sales. For any commitments for which we do not expect to take delivery and, as a result, will require net settlement, the contracts are marked to fair value on a quarterly basis. Some of the product we purchase is shipped in corrugated cardboard packaging. We sell corrugated cardboard when it is economical to do so. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we entered into six derivative instruments to protect us from declining corrugated cardboard prices. These derivatives contain a three year term. None of the contracts, either individually or in the aggregate, hedge more than 50% of our expected corrugated cardboard sales. The instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting, in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Investments and Hedging Activities, as amended. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these instruments are marked to market in our Consolidated Statement of Operations in OG&A expenses. As of January 28, 2006, an other asset totaling $3 million had been recorded for the instruments.
