ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION. OUR BUSINESS The Kroger Co. was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902. It is one of the nations largest retailers, operating 2,468 supermarket and multi department stores under two dozen banners including Kroger, Ralphs, Fred Meyer, Food 4 Less, King Soopers, Smiths, Frys, Frys Marketplace, Dillons, QFC and City Market. Of these stores, 631 had fuel centers. We also operate 779 convenience stores and 412 fine jewelry stores. Kroger operates 42 manufacturing plants, primarily bakeries and dairies, which supply approximately 55% of the corporate brand units sold in the Companys retail outlets. Our revenues are earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores. We earn income predominately by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of our costs to make these products available to our customers. Such costs include procurement and distribution costs, facility occupancy and operational costs, and overhead expenses. Our operations are reported as a single reportable segment: the retail sale of merchandise to individual customers. OUR 2006 PERFORMANCE The continued focus of our associates on delivering improved service, product selection and value to our customers generated a year of significantly improved identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel sales, in 2006. Our identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel sales, grew at 5.6% in 2006. These results followed strong 2005 identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel sales, of 3.5% in 2005 and 0.8% in 2004. Increasing market share helped us achieve our results. Our internal analysis shows that we hold the #1 or #2 market share position in 38 of our 44 major markets. We define a major market as one in which we operate nine or more stores. Our share increased in 36 of these 44 major markets, declined in seven and remained unchanged in one. On a volume weighted basis, our overall market share in these 44 major markets increased approximately 65 basis points during 2006. We compete against a total of 1,262 supercenters, an increase of 133 over 2005. There are 34 major markets in which supercenters have achieved at least a #3 market share position. Our overall market share in these 34 major markets, on a volume weighted basis, increased over 70 basis points during 2006. Our market share increased in 27 of these 34 major markets, declined in six and remained unchanged in one. All of the market share estimates described above are based on our internal data and analysis. We believe they are reliable but can provide no other assurance of reliability. We believe this market share analysis illustrates that Kroger continued to achieve significant growth in 2006, even in the face of aggressive expansion in the supermarket industry by supercenters, intense price competition, increasing fragmentation of retail formats and market consolidation. Our retail price investments, combined with our service and selling initiatives, led to these market share gains in 2006. We believe there is still significant room for growth. In our 44 major markets, we estimate approximately 47% of the share in those markets continues to be held by competitors without our economies of scale. We were able to balance our sales growth with earnings growth. Our net earnings increased 16.4% to $1.54 per diluted share in 2006, from $1.31 per diluted share in 2005. Earnings growth was primarily driven by strong identical supermarket sales growth, improving operating margins and fewer shares outstanding. In addition, fiscal 2006 included a 53rd week that benefited the year by an estimated $0.07 per diluted share, adjustments to certain deferred tax balances that benefited the year by $0.03 per diluted share, expense totaling $0.03 per diluted share for increases in legal reserves, and $0.06 per diluted share of expense for the adoption of stock option expensing. FUTURE EXPECTATIONS While we were pleased with our 2006 results, we must continue to adjust our business model to meet the changing needs and expectations of our customers. Our plan requires balance between sales growth, earnings growth and profitable capital investment. We expect to achieve identical supermarket sales growth through merchandising and operating initiatives that improve the shopping experience for our customers and continue building customer loyalty. We expect identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel sales, of 3% 5% in 2007. To the extent that these sales initiatives involve price reductions or additional costs, we expect they will be funded by operating cost reductions and productivity improvements. We expect sales improvements and cost reductions, combined with fewer shares outstanding, to drive earnings per share growth in 2007. We expect earnings per share in 2007 of $1.60 $1.65 per diluted share. This represents earnings per share growth of approximately 9% 12% in 2007, net of the effect of a 53rd week in fiscal 2006 of approximately $0.07 per diluted share. In addition, on March 15, 2007, the Board of Directors declared an increase in Krogers quarterly dividend to $0.075 per share. Further discussion on our industry, the current economic environment and our related strategic plans is included in the Outlook section. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion summarizes our operating results for 2006 compared to 2005 and for 2005 compared to 2004. Comparability is affected by certain income and expense items that fluctuated significantly between and among the periods, including goodwill and asset impairment charges and a labor dispute in southern California in 2004. Net Earnings (Loss) Net earnings totaled $1,115 million for 2006, compared to net earnings totaling $958 million in 2005 and a net loss totaling $104 million in 2004. The increase in our net earnings for 2006, compared to 2005 and 2004, resulted from improvements in the southern California market and the leveraging of fixed costs with strong identical supermarket sales growth, as well as the effect of a 53rd week in 2006. In addition, 2004 was negatively affected by goodwill charges totaling $904 million, as well as a labor dispute in southern California. Earnings per diluted share totaled $1.54 in 2006, compared to $1.31 per share in 2005 and a net loss of $0.14 per diluted share in 2004. Net earnings in 2006 benefited by $0.07 per share due to the 53rd week and $0.03 per share from the adjustment of certain deferred tax balances. Net earnings in 2006 also included expense of $0.03 per share recorded for legal reserves. Net earnings were reduced by $1.16 per share in 2004 due to the effects of goodwill impairment charges. Our earnings per share growth in 2006 and 2005 resulted from increased net earnings and the repurchase of Kroger stock. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 29 million shares of Kroger stock for a total investment of $633 million. During fiscal 2005, we repurchased 15 million shares of our stock for a total investment of $252 million. During fiscal 2004, we repurchased 20 million shares of Kroger stock for a total investment of $319 million. Sales Total Sales (in millions) Percentage Percentage 2006 Increase 2005 Increase 2004 Total food store sales without fuel $ 57,712 7.9 % $ 53,472 4.6 % $ 51,106 Total food store fuel sales 4,455 26.3 % 3,526 53.0 % 2,305 Total food store sales $ 62,167 9.1 % $ 56,998 6.7 % $ 53,411 Other sales(1) 3,944 10.9 % 3,555 17.6 % 3,023 Total Sales $ 66,111 9.2 % $ 60,553 7.3 % $ 56,434 (1) Other sales primarily relate to sales at convenience stores, including fuel, jewelry stores and sales by our manufacturing plants to outside firms. The growth in our total sales was primarily the result of identical store sales increases, the addition of a 53rd week in 2006 and inflation in pharmacy and some perishable commodities. Increased transaction count and average transaction size were both responsible for our increases in identical supermarket sales, excluding retail fuel operations. After adjusting for the extra week in fiscal 2006, total sales increased 7.0% over fiscal 2005. We define a supermarket as identical when it has been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters. Differences between total supermarket sales and identical supermarket sales primarily relate to changes in supermarket square footage. We calculate annualized identical supermarket sales based on a summation of four quarters of identical supermarket sales. Our identical supermarket sales results are summarized in the table below, based on the 53 week period of 2006, compared to the same 53 week period of the previous year. Identical Supermarket Sales (in millions) 2006 2005 Including supermarket fuel centers $ 59,592 $ 55,993 Excluding supermarket fuel centers $ 55,399 $ 52,483 Including supermarket fuel centers 6.4 % 5.3 % Excluding supermarket fuel centers 5.6 % 3.5 % We define a supermarket as comparable when it has been in operation for five full quarters, including expansions and relocations. We calculate annualized comparable supermarket sales based on a summation of four quarters of comparable sales. Our annualized comparable supermarket sales results are summarized in the table below, based on the 53 week period of 2006, compared to the same 53 week period of the previous year. Comparable Supermarket Sales (in millions) 2006 2005 Including supermarket fuel centers $ 61,045 $ 57,203 Excluding supermarket fuel centers $ 56,702 $ 53,622 Including supermarket fuel centers 6.7 % 5.9 % Excluding supermarket fuel centers 5.7 % 3.9 % FIFO Gross Margin We calculate First In, First Out (FIFO) Gross Margin as follows: Sales minus merchandise costs plus Last In, First Out (LIFO) charge (credit). Merchandise costs include advertising, warehousing and transportation, but exclude depreciation expense and rent expense. FIFO gross margin is an important measure used by our management to evaluate merchandising and operational effectiveness. Our FIFO gross margin rates were 24.27%, 24.80% and 25.38% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Retail fuel sales lowered our FIFO gross margin rate due to the very low FIFO gross margin on retail fuel sales as compared to non fuel sales. Excluding the effect of retail fuel operations, our FIFO gross margin rates were 26.43%, 26.69% and 26.73% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in our non fuel FIFO gross margin rate reflects our continued reinvestment of operating cost savings into lower prices for our customers. Operating, General and Administrative Expenses Operating, general and administrative (OG&A) expenses consist primarily of employee related costs such as wages, health care benefit costs and retirement plan costs. Among other items, rent expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and interest expense are not included in OG&A. OG&A expenses, as a percent of sales, were 17.91%, 18.21% and 18.76% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The growth in our retail fuel sales lowers our OG&A rate due to the very low OG&A rate on retail fuel sales as compared to non fuel sales. Excluding the effect of retail fuel operations, our OG&A expenses, as a percent of sales, were 19.59%, 19.68% and 19.81% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Excluding the effect of retail fuel operations, expenses recorded for legal reserves and stock option expense, our OG&A rate declined 28 basis points in 2006. This decrease was driven by identical store sales growth, by increasing store labor productivity, and by progress we have made in controlling our health care costs. These improvements were partially offset by increases in pension expense and credit card fees. Rent Expense Rent expense was $649 million in 2006, as compared to $661 million and $680 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Rent expense, as a percent of sales, was 0.98% in 2006, as compared to 1.09% in 2005 and 1.21% in 2004. The decrease in rent expense reflects our increasing sales leverage and our continued emphasis on ownership of real estate when available, as well as decreased charges for closed store future rent liabilities in 2006 and 2005 compared to 2004. Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense was $1,272 million, $1,265 million and $1,256 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increases in depreciation and amortization expense were the result of capital expenditures totaling $1,777 million, $1,306 million and $1,634 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense, as a percent of sales, was 1.92%, 2.09% and 2.23% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in our depreciation and amortization expense, as a percent of sales, is primarily the result of total sales increases. Interest Expense Net interest expense totaled $488 million, $510 million and $557 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in interest expense was the result of lower average borrowings. During 2006, we reduced total debt $173 million from $7.2 billion as of January 28, 2006, to $7.1 billion as of February 3, 2007. Interest expense in 2004 included $25 million related to the early retirement of debt. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 36.2%, 37.2% and 136.4% for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The effective tax rates for 2006 and 2005 differ from the effective tax rate for 2004 due to the impairment of non deductible goodwill in 2004. The effective income tax rates also differ from the expected federal statutory rate in all years presented due to the effect of state taxes as well as the adjustment of certain deferred tax balances in 2006. During the reconciliation of our deferred tax balances, after the filing of annual federal and state tax returns, we identified adjustments to be made in the previous years deferred tax reconciliation. We corrected these deferred tax balances in our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended February 3, 2007, which resulted in a reduction of our 2006 provision for income tax expense of approximately $21 million and reduced the rate by 120 basis points. We do not believe these adjustments are material to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended February 3, 2007, or to any prior years Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result, we have not restated any prior year amounts. COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM We maintain a stock repurchase program that complies with Securities Exchange Act Rule 10b5 1 to allow for the orderly repurchase of our common stock, from time to time. We made open market purchases totaling $374 million, $239 million and $291 million under this repurchase program during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In addition to this repurchase program, in December 1999 we began a program to repurchase common stock to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans. This program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises, including the tax benefit from these exercises. We repurchased approximately $259 million, $13 million and $28 million under the stock option program during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Capital expenditures, including changes in construction in progress payable and excluding acquisitions, totaled $1,777 million in 2006 compared to $1,306 million in 2005 and $1,634 million in 2004. The decline in 2005 was the result of our emphasis on the tightening of capital and increasing our focus on remodels, merchandising and productivity projects. The table below shows our supermarket storing activity and our total food store square footage: Supermarket Storing Activity 2006 2005 2004 Beginning of year 2,507 2,532 2,532 Opened 20 28 41 Opened (relocation) 17 12 20 Acquired 1 1 15 Acquired (relocation) 3 Closed (operational) (60 ) (54 ) (56 ) Closed (relocation) (17 ) (12 ) (23 ) End of year 2,468 2,507 2,532 Total food store square footage (in millions) 142 142 141 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position, and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Self Insurance Costs We primarily are self insured for costs related to workers compensation and general liability claims. The liabilities represent our best estimate, using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods, of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through February 3, 2007. Case reserves are established for reported claims using case basis evaluation of the underlying claim data and are updated as information becomes known. For both workers compensation and general liability claims, we have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis. We are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits. The liabilities for workers compensation claims are accounted for on a present value basis utilizing a risk adjusted discount rate. A 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase our liability by approximately $3 million. General liability claims are not discounted. We are also similarly self insured for property related losses. We have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to losses in excess of $25 million on a per claim basis, except in the case of an earthquake, for which stop loss coverage is in excess of $50 million per claim, up to $200 million per claim in California and $300 million outside of California. The assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability, which can affect the liability recorded for such claims. For example, variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized. Similarly, changes in legal trends and interpretations, as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can affect ultimate costs. Our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables, and any changes could have a considerable effect upon future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities. Impairments of Long Lived Assets In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, we monitor the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger events have occurred. These events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset. When a trigger event occurs, we perform an impairment calculation, comparing projected undiscounted cash flows, utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores, to the carrying value for those stores. If we identify impairment for long lived assets to be held and used, we compare discounted future cash flows to the assets current carrying value. We record impairment when the carrying value exceeds the discounted cash flows. With respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal, we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions. We recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value, reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal. We record costs to reduce the carrying value of long lived assets in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as Operating, general and administrative expense. The factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows. Our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation, the economy and market competition. Application of alternative assumptions and definitions, such as reviewing long lived assets for impairment at a different organizational level, could produce significantly different results. Goodwill We review goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, and also upon the occurrence of trigger events. The reviews are performed at the operating division level. Generally, fair value represents a multiple of earnings, or discounted projected future cash flows, and we compare fair value to the carrying value of a division for purposes of identifying potential impairment. We base projected future cash flows on managements knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future. If we identify potential for impairment, we measure the fair value of a division against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities, excluding goodwill, to estimate an implied fair value of the divisions goodwill. We recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of the carrying value of the divisions goodwill over the implied fair value. Results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during 2006, 2005 and 2004 are summarized in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The annual impairment review requires the extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates. Application of alternative assumptions and definitions, such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different organizational level, could produce significantly different results. Similar to our policy on impairment of long lived assets, the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several items such as inflation, the economy and market competition. Intangible Assets In addition to goodwill, we have recorded intangible assets totaling $26 million, $22 million and $28 million for leasehold equities, liquor licenses and pharmacy prescription file purchases, respectively, at February 3, 2007. Balances at January 28, 2006, were $35 million, $20 million and $30 million for lease equities, liquor licenses and pharmacy prescription files, respectively. We amortize leasehold equities over the remaining life of the lease. We do not amortize owned liquor licenses, however, we amortize liquor licenses that must be renewed over their useful lives. We amortize pharmacy prescription file purchases over seven years. We consider these assets annually during our testing for impairment. Store Closing Costs We provide for closed store liabilities relating to the present value of the estimated remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date, net of estimated subtenant income. We estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores. The closed store lease liabilities usually are paid over the lease terms associated with the closed stores, which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to 20 years. Adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates. Adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known. We review store closing liabilities quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs, or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose, is adjusted to income in the proper period. We estimate subtenant income, future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located, our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions. The ultimate cost of the disposition of the leases and the related assets is affected by current real estate markets, inflation rates and general economic conditions. We reduce owned stores held for disposal to their estimated net realizable value. We account for costs to reduce the carrying values of property, equipment and leasehold improvements in accordance with our policy on impairment of long lived assets. We classify inventory write downs in connection with store closings, if any, in Merchandise costs. We expense costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores as they are incurred. Post Retirement Benefit Plans (a) Company sponsored Pension Plans Effective February 3, 2007, we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 99, 106 and 123(R), which required the recognition of the funded status of its retirement plans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We are now required to record, as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI), actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that have not yet been recognized. The determination of our obligation and expense for Company sponsored pension plans and other post retirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts. Those assumptions are described in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and include, among others, the discount rate, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, average life expectancy and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions, including the discount rate used and the expected return on plan assets, may materially affect our pension and other post retirement obligations and our future expense. Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements discusses the effect of a 1% change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other post retirement benefit costs and the related liability. The objective of our discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. In making this determination, we take into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans. Our methodology for selecting the discount rate as of year end 2006 was to match the plans cash flows to that of a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zero coupon corporate bonds for each maturity. Benefit cash flows due in a particular year can be settled theoretically by investing them in the zero coupon bond that matures in the same year. The discount rate is the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows. The selection of the 5.90% discount rate as of year end 2006 represents the equivalent single rate under a broad market AA yield curve constructed by our outside consultant, Mercer Human Resource Consulting. We utilized a discount rate of 5.70% for year end 2005. The 20 basis point increase in the discount rate decreased the projected pension benefit obligation as of February 3, 2007, by approximately $68 million. To determine the expected return on pension plan assets, we consider current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted returns on various asset categories. For 2006 and 2005, we assumed a pension plan investment return rate of 8.5%. Our pension plans average return was 9.7% for the 10 calendar years ended December 31, 2006, net of all investment management fees and expenses. Our actual return for the pension plan calendar year ending December 31, 2006, on that same basis, was 13.4%. We believe the pension return assumption is appropriate because we do not expect that future returns will achieve the same level of performance as the historical average annual return. We have been advised that during 2007 and 2008, the trustees plan to reduce from 50% to 42% the allocation of pension plan assets to domestic and international equities and increase from 18% to 27% the allocation to non core assets, including inflation linked bonds, commodities, hedge funds and real estate. Furthermore, in order to augment the return on domestic equities and investment grade debt securities during 2007 and 2008, the trustees plan to increase hedge funds within these sectors from 7% to 22%. Collectively, these changes should improve the diversification of pension plan assets. The trustees expect these changes will have little effect on the total return but will reduce the expected volatility of the return. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the asset allocations of pension plan assets. Sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions used in the calculation of Krogers pension plan liabilities for the Qualified Plans is illustrated below (in millions). Projected Benefit Percentage Obligation Expense Point Change Decrease/(Increase) Decrease/(Increase) Discount Rate +/ 1.0 % $ 350/($306 ) $ 38/($36 ) Expected Return on Assets +/ 1.0 % $ 21/($21 ) In 2005, we updated the mortality table used to determine average life expectancy in the calculation of our pension obligation to the RP 2000 Projected to 2015 mortality table. The change in this assumption increased our projected benefit obligation by approximately $93 million at the time of the change, and is reflected in unrecognized actuarial (gain) loss as of the measurement date. We contributed $150 million, $300 million and $35 million to our Company sponsored pension plans in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Although we are not required to make cash contributions to our Company sponsored pension plans during fiscal 2007, we contributed $50 million to the plans on February 5, 2007. We may elect to make additional voluntary contributions to our Company sponsored pension plans in order to maintain our desired funding status. Additional contributions may be made if our cash flows from operations exceed our expectations. We expect any elective contributions made during 2007 will decrease our required contributions in future years. Among other things, investment performance of plan assets, the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations, and future changes in legislation, will determine the amounts of any additional contributions. Effective January 1, 2007, the Cash Balance Plan was replaced with a 401(k) Retirement Savings Account Plan, which will provide both Company matching contributions and other Company contributions based upon length of service, to eligible employees. We expect to make matching contributions in 2007 of approximately 75 million. (b) Multi Employer Plans We also contribute to various multi employer pension plans based on obligations arising from most of our collective bargaining agreements. These plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers. The benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose. Trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions. The trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans. We recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded, in accordance with GAAP. We made contributions to these plans, and recognized expense, of $204 million in 2006, $196 million in 2005, and $180 million in 2004. We estimate we would have contributed an additional $2 million in 2004 but our obligation to contribute was suspended during the southern California labor dispute. Based on the most recent information available to us, we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most or all of these multi employer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits. We have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets, (i.e., the amount of underfunding), as of December 31, 2006. Because Kroger is only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans, we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of Krogers contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing Krogers share of the underfunding. As of December 31, 2006, we estimate that Krogers share of the underfunding of multi employer plans to which Kroger contributes was $600 million to $800 million, pre tax, or $375 million to $500 million, after tax. This represents a decrease in the amount of underfunding estimated as of December 31, 2005. This decrease is attributable to, among other things, the continuing benefit of plan design changes and the investment returns on assets held in trust for the plans during 2006. Our estimate is based on the best information available to us including actuarial evaluations and other data (that include the estimates of others), and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable. Our estimate is imprecise and not necessarily reliable. We have made and disclosed this estimate not because this underfunding is a direct liability of Kroger. Rather, we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences. We expect our contributions to these multi employer plans will continue to increase each year, and therefore the expense we recognize under GAAP will increase. In 2006, our contributions to these plans increased approximately 4% over the prior year and have grown at a compound annual rate of approximately 6% since 2003. We expect our contributions to increase by approximately 1.0% in 2007. The amount of increases in 2007 and beyond has been favorably affected by significant improvement in the values of assets held in trusts, by the labor agreements negotiated in southern California and elsewhere in recent years, and by related trustee actions. Although underfunding can result in the imposition of excise taxes on contributing employers, increased contributions can reduce underfunding so that excise taxes are not triggered. Our estimate of future contribution increases takes into account the avoidance of those taxes. Finally, underfunding means that, in the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these funds, we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability. Any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated, in accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions. The amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and is disclosed for the purpose described. The amount could decline, and Krogers future expense would be favorably affected, if the values of net assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining, trustee action or favorable legislation. On the other hand, Krogers share of the underfunding would increase and Krogers future expense could be adversely affected if net asset values decline, if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining, trustee action or adverse legislation. Deferred Rent We recognize rent holidays, including the time period during which we have access to the property for construction of buildings or improvements, as well as construction allowances and escalating rent provisions on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. The deferred amount is included in Other Current Liabilities and Other Long Term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Tax Contingencies Various taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions, including state and local taxes, we record allowances for probable exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established an allowance, is audited and fully resolved. As of February 3, 2007, tax years 2002 through 2004 were undergoing examination by the Internal Revenue Service. The establishment of our tax contingency allowances relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. Although management believes those estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results could differ, resulting in gains or losses that may be material to our Consolidated Statements of Operations. To the extent that we prevail in matters for which allowances have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of these allowances, our effective tax rate in any given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement could require use of cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution. Share Based Compensation Expense Effective January 29, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, using the modified prospective transition method and, therefore, have not restated results for prior periods. Under this method, we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments granted on or after January 29, 2006, as well as all share based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of, January 29, 2006, in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R). Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), we recognize share based compensation expense, net of an estimated forfeiture rate, over the requisite service period of the award. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we accounted for share based payments under Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123, as amended. We recognized compensation expense for all share based awards described above using the straight line attribution method applied to the fair value of each option grant, over the requisite service period associated with each award. The requisite service period is typically consistent with the vesting period, except as noted below. Because awards typically vest evenly over the requisite service period, compensation cost recognized in 2006 is at least equal to the grant date fair value of the vested portion of all outstanding options. The weighted average fair value of stock options granted during 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $6.90, $7.70 and $7.91, respectively. The fair value of each stock option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model, based on the assumptions shown in the table below. The Black Scholes model utilizes extensive accounting judgment and financial estimates, including the term employees are expected to retain their stock options before exercising them, the volatility of our stock price over that expected term, the dividend yield over the term and the number of awards expected to be forfeited before they vest. Using alternative assumptions in the calculation of fair value would produce fair values for stock option grants that could be different than those used to record share based compensation expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The following table reflects the weighted average assumptions used for grants awarded to option holders. 2006 2005 2004 Weighted average expected volatility 27.60 % 30.83 % 30.13 % Weighted average risk free interest rate 5.07 % 4.11 % 3.99 % Expected dividend yield 1.50 % N/A N/A Expected term 7.5 years 8.7 years 8.7 years The weighted average risk free interest rate was based on the yield of a treasury note as of the grant date, continuously compounded, which matures at a date that approximates the expected term of the options. Prior to 2006, we did not pay a dividend, so an expected dividend rate was not included in the determination of fair value for options granted during fiscal year 2005. Using a dividend yield of 1.50% to value options issued in 2005 would have decreased the fair value of each option by approximately $1.60. We determined expected volatility based upon historical stock volatilities. We also considered implied volatility. We determined expected term based upon a combination of historical exercise and cancellation experience, as well as estimates of expected future exercise and cancellation experience. Under SFAS No. 123(R), we record expense for restricted stock awards in an amount equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date of the award. In 2006, we recognized total stock compensation expense of $72 million. This included $50 million for stock options and $22 million for restricted shares. A total of $18 million of the restricted stock expense was attributable to the wider distribution of restricted shares incorporated into the first quarter 2006 grant of share based awards (as described in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and the remaining $4 million of restricted stock expense related to previously issued restricted stock awards. The incremental compensation expense attributable to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) in 2006 was $68 million, pre tax, or $43 million and $0.06 per diluted share, after tax. In 2005, we recognized stock compensation cost of $7 million, pre tax, related entirely to restricted stock grants. These costs were recognized as operating, general and administrative costs in our Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations. The cumulative effect of applying a forfeiture rate to unvested restricted shares at January 29, 2006 was not material. The pro forma earnings effect of stock options in prior years, in accordance with SFAS No. 123, is described below: (in millions, except per share amounts) 2005 2004 Net earnings (loss), as reported $ 958 $ (104 ) Stock based compensation expense included in net earnings, net of income tax benefits 5 8 Total stock based compensation expense determined under fair value method for all awards, net of income tax benefits (1) (34 ) (48 ) Pro forma net earnings (loss) $ 929 $ (144 ) Earnings (loss) per basic common share, as reported $ 1.32 $ (0.14 ) Pro forma earnings (loss) per basic common share $ 1.28 $ (0.20 ) Earnings (loss) per diluted common share, as reported $ 1.31 $ (0.14 ) Pro forma earnings (loss) per diluted common share $ 1.27 $ (0.20 ) (1) Refer to Note 10 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of the assumptions used for options issued in each year at an option price equal to the fair market value of the stock at the date of the grant. As of February 3, 2007, we had $92 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non vested share based compensation arrangements granted under equity award plans. We expected to recognize this cost over a weighted average period of approximately one year. The total fair value of options that vested in 2006 was $44 million. For share based awards granted prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Companys stock option grants generally contained retirement eligibility provisions that caused the options to vest upon the earlier of the stated vesting date or retirement. We calculated compensation expense over the stated vesting periods, regardless of whether certain employees became retirement eligible during the respective vesting periods. Upon the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we continued this method of recognizing compensation expense of awards granted prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). For awards granted on or after January 29, 2006, options vest based on the stated vesting date, even if an employee retires prior to the vesting date. However, the requisite service period ends on the employees retirement eligible date. As a result, we recognize expense for stock option grants containing such retirement eligibility provisions over the shorter of the vesting period or the period until employees become retirement eligible (the requisite service period). As a result of retirement eligibility provisions in stock option awards granted on or after January 29, 2006, we recognized approximately $6 million of compensation expense in 2006 prior to the completion of stated vesting periods. Shares issued as a result of stock option exercises may be newly issued shares or reissued treasury shares. We expect to reissue shares held in treasury upon exercise of these options. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (principally on a LIFO basis) or market. In total, approximately 98% of inventories for 2006 and 2005, respectively, were valued using the LIFO method. Cost for the balance of the inventories was determined using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. Replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by $450 million at February 3, 2007, and by $400 million at January 28, 2006. We follow the Link Chain, Dollar Value LIFO method for purposes of calculating our LIFO charge or credit. The item cost method of accounting to determine inventory cost before the LIFO adjustment is followed for substantially all store inventories at our supermarket divisions. This method involves counting each item in inventory, assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs (net of vendor allowances and cash discounts) of each item and recording the actual cost of items sold. The item cost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory and purchasing levels when compared to the methodology followed under the retail method of accounting. We evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities. We record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date. Vendor Allowances We recognize all vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs when the related product is sold. In most cases, vendor allowances are applied to the related product by item, and therefore reduce the carrying value of inventory by item. When it is not practicable to allocate vendor allowances to the product by item, vendor allowances are recognized as a reduction in merchandise costs based on inventory turns and recognized as the product is sold. We recognized approximately $3.3 billion, $3.2 billion and $3.1 billion of vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We recognized more than 80% of all vendor allowances in the item cost with the remainder being based on inventory turns. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flow Information Net cash provided by operating activities We generated $2,351 million of cash from operations in 2006 compared to $2,192 million in 2005 and $2,330 million in 2004. In addition to changes in net earnings, changes in our operating assets and liabilities also affect the amount of cash provided by our operating activities. During 2006, we realized a $129 million decrease in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities, compared to a $121 million increase and a $116 million decrease during 2005 and 2004, respectively. These amounts are net of cash contributions to our Company sponsored pension plans totaling $150 million in 2006, $300 million in 2005 and $35 million in 2004. The amount of cash paid for income taxes in 2006 was higher than the amounts paid in 2005 and 2004 due to higher net earnings. In addition, the bonus depreciation provision, which expired in December 2004, reduced our cash taxes by approximately $90 million in 2004. This benefit reversed in 2005 and increased our cash taxes by approximately $71 and $108 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net cash used by investing activities Cash used by investing activities was $1,587 million in 2006, compared to $1,279 million in 2005 and $1,608 million in 2004. The amount of cash used by investing activities increased in 2006 due to increased capital spending, partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of assets. Capital expenditures, including changes in construction in progress payables and excluding acquisitions, were $1,777 million, $1,306 million and $1,634 billion in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Refer to the Capital Expenditures section for an overview of our supermarket storing activity during the last three years. Net cash used by financing activities Financing activities used $785 million of cash in 2006 compared to $847 million in 2005 and $737 million in 2004. Lower cash payments for debt reduction in 2006 were partially offset by increased stock repurchase activities and dividend payments in 2006. We repurchased $633 million of Kroger stock in 2006 compared to $252 million in 2005 and $319 million in 2004, and paid dividends totaling $140 million in 2006. Debt Management Total debt, including both the current and long term portions of capital leases and financing obligations, decreased $173 million to $7.1 billion as of year end 2006 from $7.2 billion as of year end 2005. Total debt decreased $739 million to $7.2 billion as of year end 2005 from $8.0 billion as of year end 2004. The decreases were primarily the result of using cash flow from operations to reduce outstanding debt. Our total debt balances were also affected by our prefunding of employee benefit costs and by the mark to market adjustments necessary to record fair value interest rate hedges of our fixed rate debt, pursuant to SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Investments and Hedging Activities, as amended. We had prefunded employee benefit costs of $300 million at year end 2006, 2005 and 2004. The mark to market adjustments increased the carrying value of our debt by $17 million, $27 million and $70 million as of year end 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Factors Affecting Liquidity We currently borrow on a daily basis approximately $170 million under our F2/P2/A3 rated commercial paper (CP) program. These borrowings are backed by our credit facility, and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility. We have capacity available under our credit facility to backstop all CP amounts outstanding. If our credit rating declined below its current level of BBB/Baa2/BBB , the ability to borrow under our current CP program could be adversely affected for a period of time immediately following the reduction of our credit rating. This could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility, under which we believe we have sufficient capacity. Borrowings under the credit facility may be more costly than the money we borrow under our current CP program, depending on the current interest rate environment. However, in the event of a ratings decline, we do not anticipate that access to the CP markets currently available to us would be significantly limited for an extended period of time (i.e., in excess of 30 days). Although our ability to borrow under the credit facility is not affected by our credit rating, the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facility would be affected by a decrease in our credit rating or a decrease in our Applicable Percentage Ratio. Our credit facility also requires the maintenance of a Leverage Ratio and a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (our financial covenants). A failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facility. These financial covenants and ratios are described below: Our Applicable Percentage Ratio (the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Total Interest Expense, as defined in the credit facility) was 7.50 to 1 as of February 3, 2007. Upon furnishing notice to the lenders, this ratio will entitle us to a 0.05% reduction in fees under the credit facility. Although our current borrowing rate is determined based on our Applicable Percentage Ratio, under certain circumstances that borrowing rate could be determined by reference to our credit ratings. Our Leverage Ratio (the ratio of Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the credit facility) was 2.04 to 1 as of February 3, 2007. If this ratio exceeded 3.50 to 1, we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired. Our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA plus Consolidated Rental Expense to Consolidated Cash Interest Expense plus Consolidated Rental Expense, as defined in the credit facility) was 3.66 to 1 as of February 3, 2007. If this ratio fell below 1.70 to 1, we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired. Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in our credit facility, includes an adjustment for unusual gains and losses. Our credit agreement is more fully described in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We were in compliance with our financial covenants at year end 2006. The tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments, based on year of maturity or settlement, as of February 3, 2007 (in millions of dollars): 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations Long term debt $ 878 $ 993 $ 912 $ 42 $ 537 $ 3,219 $ 6,581 Interest on long term debt (1) 428 332 304 250 222 1,712 3,248 Capital lease obligations 57 54 52 51 49 294 557 Operating lease obligations 778 734 690 642 587 4,118 7,549 Low income housing obligations 6 2 8 Financed lease obligations 11 11 11 11 11 157 212 Construction commitments 190 190 Purchase obligations 431 56 46 34 23 16 606 Total $ 2,779 $ 2,182 $ 2,015 $ 1,030 $ 1,429 $ 9,516 $ 18,951 Other Commercial Commitments Credit facility $ 352 $ $ $ $ $ $ 352 Standby letters of credit 331 331 Surety bonds 53 53 Guarantees 6 6 Total $ 742 $ $ $ $ $ $ 742 (1) Amounts include contractual interest payments using the interest rate as of February 3, 2007 applicable to our variable interest debt instruments, excluding commercial paper borrowings due to the short term nature of these borrowings, and stated fixed interest rates for all other debt instruments. Our construction commitments include funds owed to third parties for projects currently under construction. These amounts are reflected in other current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our purchase obligations include commitments to be utilized in the normal course of business, such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our manufacturing plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and manufacturing facilities. Our obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties. Any upfront vendor allowances or incentives associated with outstanding purchase commitments are recorded as either current or long term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of February 3, 2007, we maintained a five year revolving credit facility totaling $2.5 billion, which terminates in 2011. Outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and commercial paper borrowings, and some outstanding letters of credit, reduce funds available under the credit facility. In addition to the credit facility, we maintain a $50 million money market line, borrowings under which also reduce the funds available under our credit facility. The money market line borrowings allow us to borrow from banks at mutually agreed upon rates, usually at rates below the rates offered under the credit agreement. As of February 3, 2007, we had outstanding borrowings totaling $352 million under our credit agreement and commercial paper program. We had no borrowings under the money market line as of February 3, 2007. The outstanding letters of credit that reduced the funds available under our credit facility totaled $331 million as of February 3, 2007. In addition to the available credit mentioned above, as of February 3, 2007, we had available for issuance $1.2 billion of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC and declared effective on December 9, 2004. We also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our self insured workers compensation claims. These bonds are required by most states in which we are self insured for workers compensation and are placed with third party insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to meet our claim payment obligations up to our self insured retention levels. These bonds do not represent liabilities of Kroger, as we already have reserves on our books for the claims costs. Market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and, in some instances, availability of these bonds may become more limited, which could affect our costs of, or access to, such bonds. Although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly affect our ability to access these surety bonds, if this does become an issue, we would issue letters of credit, in states where allowed, against our credit facility to meet the state bonding requirements. This could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facility. Most of our outstanding public debt is jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed by The Kroger Co. and some of our subsidiaries. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of those arrangements. In addition, we have guaranteed half of the indebtedness of three real estate joint ventures in which we are a partner with 50% ownership. Our share of the responsibility for this indebtedness, should the partnerships be unable to meet their obligations, totals approximately $6 million. Based on the covenants underlying this indebtedness as of February 3, 2007, it is unlikely that we will be responsible for repayment of these obligations. We also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions. We could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations. Due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties, and various other remedies available to us, we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote. We have agreed to indemnify certain third party logistics operators for certain expenses, including pension trust fund withdrawal liabilities. In addition to the above, we enter into various indemnification agreements and take on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business. Such arrangements include indemnities against third party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to Kroger; indemnities related to the sale of our securities; indemnities of directors, officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work; and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans. While Krogers aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability, we are aware of no current matter that we expect to result in a material liability RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2002), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123(R)), which replaced SFAS No. 123, superseded APB No. 25 and related interpretations and amended SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS No 123(R) requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements as compensation cost based on their fair value on the date of grant. We adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) in the first quarter of 2006. The implementation of SFAS No. 123(R) reduced our net earnings $0.06 per diluted share in 2006. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the effect the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) had on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 99, 106, and 123(R). SFAS No. 158 requires an employer that sponsors one or more single employer defined benefit plans to recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plans overfunded status or a liability for a plans underfunded status. In addition, SFAS No. 158 requires an employer to measure a plans assets and obligations and determine its funded status as of the end of the employers fiscal year and recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year the changes occur and that those changes be recorded in comprehensive income, net of tax, as a separate component of shareowners equity. SFAS No. 158 also requires additional footnote disclosure. The recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158 became effective for us on February 3, 2007. The measurement date provisions of SFAS No. 158 will become effective for our fiscal year beginning February 1, 2009. See Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the effects the implementation of SFAS No. 158 had on our Consolidated Financial Statements. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This Interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN No. 48 becomes effective for our fiscal year beginning February 4, 2007. We are evaluating the effect the implementation of FIN No. 48 will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurement. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurement. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 will become effective for our fiscal year beginning February 3, 2008. We are evaluating the effect the implementation of SFAS No. 157 will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. SFAS No. 159 permits entities to make an irrevocable election to measure certain financial instruments and other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected should be recognized into net earnings at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS No. 159 will be become effective for our fiscal year beginning February 3, 2008. We are currently evaluating the effect the adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issue No. 06 03, How Taxes Get Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That Is, Gross versus Net Presentation). EITF No. 06 03 indicates that the income statement presentation of taxes within the scope of the Issue on either a gross basis or a net basis is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed pursuant to Opinion 22. EITF No. 06 03 becomes effective for our fiscal year beginning February 4, 2007. We do not expect the adoption of EITF No. 06 03 to have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. OUTLOOK This discussion and analysis contains certain forward looking statements about Krogers future performance. These statements are based on managements assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available. Such statements relate to, among other things: projected change in net earnings; identical sales growth; expected pension plan contributions; our ability to generate operating cash flow; projected capital expenditures; square footage growth; opportunities to reduce costs; cash flow requirements; and our operating plan for the future; and are indicated by words such as comfortable, committed, will, expect, goal, should, intend, target, believe, anticipate, and similar words or phrases. These forward looking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations, projections, beliefs, intentions or strategies are forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21 E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. While we believe that the statements are accurate, uncertainties about the general economy, our labor relations, our ability to execute our plans on a timely basis and other uncertainties described below could cause actual results to differ materially. We expect earnings per share in the range of $1.60 $1.65 for 2007. This represents earnings per share growth of approximately 9% 12% in 2007, net of the effect of a 53rd week in fiscal 2006 of approximately $0.07 per diluted share. We anticipate earnings per share growth rates in the 1st and 4th quarters of 2007 will be less than the annual growth rate, and the 2nd and 3rd quarter growth rates will be higher than the annual growth rate. We expect identical food store sales growth, excluding fuel sales, of 3% 5% in 2007. In fiscal 2007, we will continue to focus on driving sales growth and balancing investments in gross margin and improved customer service with operating cost reductions to provide a better shopping experience for our customers. We expect operating margins to improve slightly in 2007. We plan to use, over the long term, one third of cash flow for debt reduction and two thirds for stock repurchase and payment of a cash dividend. We expect to obtain sales growth from new square footage, as well as from increased productivity from existing locations. Capital expenditures reflect our strategy of growth through expansion and acquisition, as well as focusing on productivity increase from our existing store base through remodels. In addition, we will continue our emphasis on self development and ownership of real estate, logistics and technology improvements. The continued capital spending in technology is focused on improving store operations, logistics, manufacturing procurement, category management, merchandising and buying practices, and should reduce merchandising costs. We intend to continue using cash flow from operations to finance capital expenditure requirements. We expect capital investment for 2007 to be in the range of $1.9 $2.1 billion, excluding acquisitions. Total food store square footage is expected to grow approximately 2% before acquisitions and operational closings. Based on current operating trends, we believe that cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity, including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility, will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, interest payments and scheduled principal payments for the foreseeable future. We also believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to respond effectively to competitive conditions. We expect that our OG&A results will be affected by increased costs, such as higher energy costs, pension costs and credit card fees, as well as any future labor disputes, offset by improved productivity from process changes, cost savings negotiated in recently completed labor agreements and leverage gained through sales increases. We expect that our effective tax rate for 2007 will be approximately 38%, excluding any effects from the implementation of FIN No. 48. We expect rent expense, as a percent of total sales and excluding closed store activity, will decrease due to the emphasis our current strategy places on ownership of real estate. We believe that in 2007 there will be opportunities to reduce our operating costs in such areas as administration, labor, shrink, warehousing and transportation. These savings will be invested in our core business to drive profitable sales growth and offer improved value and shopping experiences for our customers. Although we are not required to make cash contributions during fiscal 2007, we made a $50 million cash contribution to our Company sponsored pension plans on February 5, 2007. Additional voluntary contributions may be made if our cash flows from operations exceed our expectations. We expect any additional elective contributions made during 2007 will reduce our contributions in future years. Among other things, investment performance of plan assets, the interest rates required to be used to calculate pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of any additional contributions. In addition, we expect to make automatic and matching cash contributions to the 401(k) Retirement Savings Account Plan totaling $75 million in 2007. We expect our contributions to multi employer pension plans to increase at 1.0% over the $204 million we contributed during 2006. Various uncertainties and other factors could cause us to fail to achieve our goals. These include: We have various labor agreements expiring in 2007, covering associates in southern California, Cincinnati, Detroit, Houston, Memphis, Toledo, Seattle and West Virginia. We are currently operating under a contract extension in southern California. In all of these contracts, rising health care and pension costs will continue to be an important issue in negotiations. Third parties who operate a distribution facility for us in Louisville, Kentucky, are operating without a labor agreement, and the union representing employees there may call a strike if an agreement is not reached. A prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material effect on our results. Our ability to achieve sales and earnings goals may be affected by: labor disputes; industry consolidation; pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors, including non traditional competitors; our response to these actions; the state of the economy, including the inflationary and deflationary trends in certain commodities; stock repurchases; and the success of our future growth plans. In addition to the factors identified above, our identical store sales growth could be affected by increases in Kroger private label sales, the effect of our sister stores (new stores opened in close proximity to an existing store) and reductions in retail pricing. Our operating margins could fail to improve as expected if we are unsuccessful at containing our operating costs. We have estimated our exposure to the claims and litigation arising in the normal course of business, as well as in material litigation facing Kroger, and believe we have made adequate provisions for them where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where we believe an adverse outcome is probable. Unexpected outcomes in these matters, however, could result in an adverse effect on our earnings. The proportion of cash flow used to reduce outstanding debt, repurchase common stock and pay a cash dividend may be affected by the amount of outstanding debt available for pre payments, changes in borrowing rates and the market price of Kroger common stock. Consolidation in the food industry is likely to continue and the effects on our business, either favorable or unfavorable, cannot be foreseen. Rent expense, which includes subtenant rental income, could be adversely affected by the state of the economy, increased store closure activity and future consolidation. Depreciation expense, which includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital leases, is computed principally using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of individual assets, or the remaining terms of leases. Use of the straight line method of depreciation creates a risk that future asset write offs or potential impairment charges related to store closings would be larger than if an accelerated method of depreciation was followed. Our effective tax rate may differ from the expected rate due to changes in laws, the status of pending items with various taxing authorities and the deductibility of certain expenses. The amount of our matching cash contributions under our 401(k) Retirement Savings Account Plan will be affected by the actual amounts contributed by participants. We believe the multi employer pension funds to which we contribute are substantially underfunded. Should asset values in these funds deteriorate, or if employers withdraw from these funds without providing for their share of the liability, or should our estimates prove to be understated, our contributions could increase more rapidly than we have anticipated. The grocery retail industry continues to experience fierce competition from other traditional food retailers, supercenters, mass merchandisers, club or warehouse stores, drug stores and restaurants. Our continued success is dependent upon our ability to compete in this industry and to reduce operating expenses, including managing health care and pension costs contained in our collective bargaining agreements. The competitive environment may cause us to reduce our prices in order to gain or maintain share of sales, thus reducing margins. While we believe our opportunities for sustained profitable growth are considerable, unanticipated actions of competitors could adversely affect our sales. Changes in laws or regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements and environmental laws may have a material effect on our financial statements. Changes in the general business and economic conditions in our operating regions, including the rate of inflation, population growth and employment and job growth in the markets in which we operate, may affect our ability to hire and train qualified employees to operate our stores. This would negatively affect earnings and sales growth. General economic changes may also affect the shopping habits of our customers, which could affect sales and earnings. Changes in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial indicators. For example, we continue to add supermarket fuel centers to our store base. Since gasoline generates low profit margins, including generating decreased margins as the market price increases, we expect to see our FIFO gross profit margins decline as gasoline sales increase. Although this negatively affects our FIFO gross margin, gasoline sales provide a positive effect on operating, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales. Our ability to integrate any companies we acquire or have acquired, and achieve operating improvements at those companies, will affect our operations. Our capital expenditures, expected square footage growth, and number of store projects completed during the year could differ from our estimate if we are unsuccessful in acquiring suitable sites for new stores, if development costs vary from those budgeted or if our logistics and technology projects are not completed in the time frame expected or on budget. Interest expense could be adversely affected by the interest rate environment, changes in the Companys credit ratings, fluctuations in the amount of outstanding debt, decisions to incur prepayment penalties on the early redemption of debt and any factor that adversely affects our operations that results in an increase in debt. Adverse weather conditions could increase the cost our suppliers charge for their products, or may decrease the customer demand for certain products. Additionally, increases in the cost of inputs, such as utility costs or raw material costs, could negatively affect financial ratios and earnings. Although we presently operate only in the United States, civil unrest in foreign countries in which our suppliers do business may affect the prices we are charged for imported goods. If we are unable to pass on these increases to our customers, our FIFO gross margin and net earnings will suffer. Other factors and assumptions not identified above could also cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking information. Accordingly, actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in, contemplated or implied by forward looking statements made by us or our representatives. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Financial Risk Management We use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. As a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure. Because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure, fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure. The interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets. We manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of variable and fixed rate debt, and interest rate swaps. Our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates both fixing the rates on variable rate debt and hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. To do this, we use the following guidelines: (i) use average daily bank balance to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure, (ii) limit the annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of $2.5 billion or less, (iii) include no leveraged products, and (iv) hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current mark to market status. As of February 3, 2007, we maintained six interest rate swap agreements, with notional amounts totaling approximately $1,050 million, to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates. These agreements mature at varying times between March 2008 and January 2015. Variable rates for our agreements are based on U.S. dollar London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements and is recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense. These interest rate swap agreements are being accounted for as fair value hedges. As of February 3, 2007, other long term liabilities totaling $28 million were recorded to reflect the fair value of these agreements, offset by decreases in the fair value of the underlying debt. In addition, as of February 3, 2007, we maintained three forward starting interest rate swap agreements, with notional amounts totaling $750 million, to manage our exposure to changes in future benchmark interest rates. A forward starting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges future benchmark interest rates, including general corporate spreads, on debt for an established period of time. We entered into the forward starting interest rate swaps in order to lock in fixed interest rates on our forecasted issuances of debt in fiscal 2007 and 2008. Accordingly, these instruments have been designated as cash flow hedges for our forecasted debt issuances. Two of these swaps have ten year terms, with the remaining swap having a twelve year term, beginning with the issuance of the debt. The average fixed rate for these instruments is 5.14%, and the variable rate will be determined at the inception date of the swap. As of February 3, 2007, we had recorded an other asset totaling $12 million to reflect the fair value of these agreements. During 2003, we terminated six interest rate swap agreements that we accounted for as fair value hedges. We recorded approximately $114 million of proceeds received as a result of these terminations as adjustments to the carrying values of the underlying debt and they are being amortized over the remaining lives of the debt. As of February 3, 2007, the unamortized balances totaled approximately $46 million. Annually, we review with the Financial Policy Committee of our Board of Directors compliance with the guidelines. The guidelines may change as our business needs dictate. The tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives and underlying debt portfolio as of February 3, 2007. The amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of long term debt, excluding capital leases, and the average outstanding notional amounts of interest rate derivatives as of February 3, 2007. Interest rates reflect the weighted average for the outstanding instruments. The variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on U.S. dollar LIBOR using the forward yield curve as of February 3, 2007. The Fair Value column includes the fair value of our debt instruments and interest rate derivatives as of February 3, 2007.

We enter into commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of normal business. Those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in the normal course of business qualify as normal purchases and normal sales. For any commitments for which we do not expect to take delivery and, as a result, will require net settlement, the contracts are marked to fair value on a quarterly basis. Some of the product we purchase is shipped in corrugated cardboard packaging. We sell corrugated cardboard when it is economical to do so. As of February 3, 2007, we maintained seven derivative instruments to protect us from declining corrugated cardboard prices. These derivatives contain a three year term. None of the contracts, either individually or in the aggregate, hedge more than 50% of our expected corrugated cardboard sales. The instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting, in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Investments and Hedging Activities, as amended. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these instruments are marked to market in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in OG&A expenses. As of February 3, 2007, an accrued expense totaling $0.2 million had been recorded for the instruments.
