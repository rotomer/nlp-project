ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OUR BUSINESS The Kroger Co. was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902. It is one of the nations largest retailers, as measured by revenue, operating 2,481 supermarket and multi department stores under two dozen banners including Kroger, Ralphs, Fred Meyer, Food 4 Less, King Soopers, Smiths, Frys, Frys Marketplace, Dillons, QFC and City Market. Of these stores, 781 have fuel centers. We also operate 771 convenience stores and 385 fine jewelry stores. Kroger operates 40 manufacturing plants, primarily bakeries and dairies, which supply approximately 40% of the corporate brand units sold in our retail outlets. Our revenues are earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores. We earn income predominately by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of the costs we incur to make these products available to our customers. Such costs include procurement and distribution costs, facility occupancy and operational costs, and overhead expenses. Our operations are reported as a single reportable segment: the retail sale of merchandise to individual customers. OUR 2008 PERFORMANCE By focusing on the customer through our Customer 1st strategy, we were able to report solid results for fiscal year 2008 in a particularly tough economy. At the beginning of the year, we expected to grow supermarket identical sales, excluding fuel, by 3% to 5%. For 2008, supermarket identical sales, excluding fuel, were 5.0%, meeting the upper end of our original guidance. At the outset of fiscal year 2008, Krogers earnings guidance was a range of $1.83 to $1.90 per diluted share. Our 2008 earnings was $1.90 per diluted share or $1.92 per diluted share, excluding the effect of a $.02 per diluted share charge for damage and disruption caused by Hurricane Ike. Our 2008 earnings of $1.92 per diluted share, excluding the charge for damage and disruption caused by Hurricane Ike, represents a growth rate of 13.6% over Krogers 2007 full year earnings of $1.69 per diluted share. We believe that this growth plus Krogers dividend yield of more than 1%, creates a strong return for shareholders. Our market share also rose in 2008. Based on our internal data and analysis, we estimate that our market share increased approximately 61 basis points in 2008 across our 42 major markets. We define a major market as one in which we operate nine or more stores. This is the fourth consecutive year Kroger has achieved significant market share gain. Over the past four years combined, Krogers market share in our major markets has increased approximately 225 basis points. Market share is critical to us because it allows us to leverage the fixed costs in our business over a wider revenue base. We hold the number one or number two market share position in 39 of or our 42 major markets. Our fundamental operating philosophy is to maintain and increase market share. These market share results demonstrate to us that our long term strategy is working. As population growth continues in the major markets where we operate, we intend to continue to grow Krogers business by maintaining our existing strong market share and by building on additional opportunities for sales growth. We estimate that approximately 45% of the share in our major markets as much as $100 billion is held by competitors who do not have Krogers economies of scale. Our economies of scale allow us to deliver increasing value to customers, which is a competitive edge, particularly in todays economic climate. Krogers business model is structured to produce sustainable earnings per share growth in a variety of economic and competitive conditions, primarily through strong identical sales growth. We believe this is the right approach to produce sustainable earnings growth over a long period of time. We recognize that continual investment in our Customer 1st strategy is necessary to drive strong, sustainable identical sales growth. We believe that this Customer 1st strategy along with our financial strategies are delivering value to customers, shareholders, bondholders, and our associates, and so we remain committed to our plan. 11 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion summarizes our operating results for 2008 compared to 2007 and for 2007 compared to 2006. Comparability is affected by certain income and expense items that fluctuated significantly between and among the periods. Net Earnings Net earnings totaled $1.2 billion for 2008, compared to net earnings totaling $1.2 billion in 2007 and $1.1 billion in 2006. The increase in our net earnings for 2008, compared to 2007 and 2006, resulted from strong non fuel identical supermarket sales growth and strong fuel results. In addition, 2006 net earnings included a 53rd week. Earnings per diluted share totaled $1.90 or $1.92, excluding the effect of a $.02 per diluted share charge for damage and disruption caused by Hurricane Ike, in 2008, compared to $1.69 per diluted share in 2007 and $1.54 per diluted share in 2006. Earnings per diluted share increased 13.6% in 2008, excluding the effect of a $.02 per diluted share charge for damage and disruption caused by Hurricane Ike, compared to 2007. Earnings per diluted share increased 15% in 2007, compared to 2006, after adjusting for the extra week in fiscal 2006. Net earnings in 2006 benefited from a 53rd week by an estimated $.07 per share. Our earnings per share growth in 2008, 2007 and 2006 resulted from increased net earnings, strong identical sales growth and the repurchase of Kroger stock. During fiscal 2008, we repurchased 24 million shares of Kroger stock for a total investment of $637 million. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 53 million shares of our stock for a total investment of $1.4 billion. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 29 million shares of Kroger stock for a total investment of $633 million. Sales Total Sales (in millions) 2008 Percentage Increase 2007 Percentage Increase 2006 Total food store sales without fuel $ 63,795 6.1 % $ 60,142 4.2 % $ 57,712 Total food store fuel sales 7,464 30.0 % 5,741 28.9 % 4,455 Total food store sales $ 71,259 8.2 % $ 65,883 6.0 % $ 62,167 Other sales(1) 4,741 8.9 % 4,352 10.3 % 3,944 Total Sales $ 76,000 8.2 % $ 70,235 6.2 % $ 66,111 (1) Other sales primarily relate to sales at convenience stores, including fuel, jewelry stores and sales by our manufacturing plants to outside customers. The growth in our total sales in 2008 over fiscal 2007 was primarily the result of identical supermarket sales increases, increased fuel gallon sales, and inflation across most departments. Identical supermarket sales and total sales, excluding fuel, increased due to increased transaction count and average transaction size, and inflation across all departments. After adjusting for the extra week in fiscal 2006, total sales increased 8.2% in 2007 over fiscal 2006. We define a supermarket as identical when it has been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters. Fuel center discounts received at our fuel centers and earned based on in store purchases are included in all of the supermarket identical sales results calculations illustrated below. Differences between total supermarket sales and identical supermarket sales primarily relate to changes in supermarket square footage. Annualized identical supermarket sales include all sales at the Fred Meyer multi department stores. We calculate annualized identical supermarket sales by adding together four quarters of identical supermarket sales. Our identical supermarket sales results are summarized in the table below, based on the 52 week period of 2008, compared to the 52 week period of the previous year. The identical store count in the table below represents the total number of identical supermarkets as of January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008. 12 Identical Supermarket Sales (in millions) 2008 2007 Including supermarket fuel centers $ 67,185 $ 62,878 Excluding supermarket fuel centers $ 60,300 $ 57,416 Including supermarket fuel centers 6.9 % 6.9 % Excluding supermarket fuel centers 5.0 % 5.3 % Identical 4th Quarter store count 2,369 2,280 We define a supermarket as comparable when it has been in operation for five full quarters, including expansions and relocations. As is the case for identical supermarket sales, fuel center discounts received at our fuel centers and earned based on in store purchases are included in all of the supermarket comparable sales results calculations illustrated below. Annualized comparable supermarket sales include all Fred Meyer multi department stores. We calculate annualized comparable supermarket sales by adding together four quarters of comparable sales. Our annualized comparable supermarket sales results are summarized in the table below, based on the 52 week period of 2008, compared to the same 52 week period of the previous year. The comparable store count in the table below represents the total number of comparable supermarkets as of January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008. Comparable Supermarket Sales (in millions) 2008 2007 Including supermarket fuel centers $ 69,762 $ 65,066 Excluding supermarket fuel centers $ 62,492 $ 59,372 Including supermarket fuel centers 7.2 % 7.2 % Excluding supermarket fuel centers 5.3 % 5.5 % Comparable 4th Quarter store count 2,444 2,352 FIFO Gross Margin We calculate First In, First Out (FIFO) Gross Margin as sales minus merchandise costs, including advertising, warehousing and transportation, but excluding the Last In, First Out (LIFO) charge. Merchandise costs exclude depreciation and rent expense. FIFO gross margin is an important measure used by management to evaluate merchandising and operational effectiveness. Our FIFO gross margin rates were 23.20% in 2008, 23.65% in 2007 and 24.27% in 2006. Our retail fuel sales reduce our FIFO gross margin rate due to the very low FIFO gross margin on retail fuel sales as compared to non fuel sales. Excluding the effect of retail fuel operations, our FIFO gross margin rates decreased 15 basis points in 2008, 20 basis points in 2007 and 26 basis points in 2006. The decrease in our non fuel FIFO gross margin rate reflects our continued reinvestment of operating cost savings into lower prices for our customers. In addition, FIFO gross margin in 2008, compared to 2007, decreased due to high inflation in product costs. LIFO Charge The LIFO charge was $196 million in 2008, $154 million in 2007 and $50 million in 2006. Like many food retailers, we continued to experience product cost inflation in 2008 at levels that have not occurred for several years. This increase in product cost inflation caused the increase in the LIFO charge in 2008, compared to 2007 and 2006. In addition, product cost inflation in 2007, compared to 2006, caused the increase in the LIFO charge in 2007 compared to 2006. Operating, General and Administrative Expenses Operating, general and administrative (OG&A) expenses consist primarily of employee related costs such as wages, health care benefit costs and retirement plan costs, utilities and credit card fees. Rent expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and interest expense are not included in OG&A. 13 OG&A expenses, as a percent of sales, were 16.95% in 2008, 17.31% in 2007 and 17.91% in 2006. The growth in our retail fuel sales reduces our OG&A rate due to the very low OG&A rate on retail fuel sales as compared to non fuel sales. OG&A expenses, as a percent of sales excluding fuel, decreased 3 basis points in 2008, 33 basis points in 2007 and 9 basis points in 2006. The decrease in our OG&A rate in 2008, excluding the effect of retail fuel operations, was primarily the result of increased identical supermarkets sales growth and a settlement received from credit card processers, partially offset by the $25 million charge related to Hurricane Ike and increases in credit card fees and health care costs. The decrease in our OG&A rate in 2007, excluding the effect of retail fuel operations, was primarily the result of strong identical sales growth, increased productivity, and progress that was made in 2007 in controlling our utility, health care and pension costs. These improvements were partially offset by increases in credit card fees. Excluding the effect of retail fuel operations and expenses recorded for one time legal reserves, our OG&A rate declined 16 basis points in 2006. Rent Expense Rent expense was $659 million in 2008, as compared to $644 million in 2007 and $649 million in 2006. Rent expense, as a percent of sales, was 0.87% in 2008, as compared to 0.92% in 2007 and 0.98% in 2006. The decrease in rent expense, as a percent of sales, reflects our increasing sales and our continued emphasis on owning rather than leasing whenever possible. Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation expense was $1.4 billion in 2008, $1.4 billion in 2007 and $1.3 billion in 2006. The increases in depreciation and amortization expense were the result of capital expenditures totaling $2.2 billion in 2008, $2.1 billion in 2007 and $1.8 billion in 2006. Depreciation and amortization expense, as a percent of sales, was 1.90% in 2008, 1.93% in 2007 and 1.92% in 2006. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in 2008, compared to 2007, as a percent of sales, is primarily the result of increasing sales. The increase in our depreciation and amortization expense in 2007, compared to 2006, as a percent of sales, is due to an annual depreciation charge in both years with 2006 containing 53 weeks of sales due to the structure of our fiscal calendar. Interest Expense Net interest expense totaled $485 million in 2008, $474 million in 2007 and $488 million in 2006. The increase in interest expense in 2008, compared to 2007, was primarily the result of an increase in the average total debt balance for the year, partially offset by interest income related to the mark to market of ineffective fair value swaps. The decrease in interest expense in 2007, compared to 2006, was the result of replacing borrowings with new borrowings at a lower interest rate. The average total debt balance in 2007 was comparable to 2006. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 36.5% in 2008, 35.4% in 2007 and 36.2% in 2006. The effective tax rates for those years differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state income taxes. In addition, the effective tax rate for 2007 differs from the expected federal statutory rate due to the resolution of some tax issues. The effective rate in 2006 includes an adjustment of some deferred tax balances. During the third quarter of 2007, we resolved favorably some outstanding tax issues. This resulted in a 2007 tax benefit of approximately $40 million and reduced our effective tax rate by 1.9%. In 2006, during the reconciliation of our deferred tax balances, and after the filing of our annual federal and state tax returns, we identified adjustments to be made in prior years deferred tax reconciliation. We corrected these deferred tax balances in our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended February 3, 2007, which resulted in a reduction of our fiscal 2006 provision for income tax expense of approximately $21 million and reduced the rate by 1.2%. We do not believe these adjustments are material to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended February 3, 2007, or to any prior years Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result, we have not restated any prior year amounts. 14 COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM We maintain stock repurchase programs that comply with Securities Exchange Act Rule 10b5 1 and allow for the orderly repurchase of our common stock, from time to time. We made open market purchases totaling $448 million in 2008, $1.2 billion in 2007 and $374 million in 2006 under these repurchase programs. In addition to these repurchase programs, in December 1999 we began a program to repurchase common stock to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans. This program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises, and the tax benefit from these exercises. We repurchased approximately $189 million in 2008, $270 million in 2007 and $259 million in 2006 under the stock option programs. In 2008, to preserve liquidity and financial flexibility, we reduced the amount of stock repurchased during the year, decreasing the cash used for stock purchases in 2008, compared to 2007. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Capital expenditures, including changes in construction in progress payables and excluding acquisitions, totaled $2.2 billion in 2008 compared to $2.1 billion in 2007 and $1.8 billion in 2006. The increase in capital spending in 2008 compared to 2007 and 2006 was the result of increasing our focus on remodels, merchandising and productivity projects. The table below shows our supermarket storing activity and our total food store square footage: Supermarket Storing Activity 2008 2007 2006 Beginning of year 2,486 2,468 2,507 Opened 21 23 20 Opened (relocation) 14 9 17 Acquired 6 38 1 Acquired (relocation) 3 1 Closed (operational) (32 ) (43 ) (60 ) Closed (relocation) (17 ) (10 ) (17 ) End of year 2,481 2,486 2,468 Total food store square footage (in millions) 147 145 142 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position, and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. 15 Self Insurance Costs We primarily are self insured for costs related to workers compensation and general liability claims. The liabilities represent our best estimate, using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods, of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through January 31, 2009. We establish case reserves for reported claims using case basis evaluation of the underlying claim data and we update as information becomes known. For both workers compensation and general liability claims, we have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis. We are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits. We account for the liabilities for workers compensation claims on a present value basis utilizing a risk adjusted discount rate. A 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase our liability by approximately $4 million. General liability claims are not discounted. We are also similarly self insured for property related losses. We have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to losses in excess of $25 million on a per claim basis, except in the case of an earthquake, for which stop loss coverage is in excess of $50 million per claim, up to $200 million per claim in California and $300 million outside of California. The assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability, which can affect the liability recorded for such claims. For example, variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized. Similarly, changes in legal trends and interpretations, as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can affect ultimate costs. Our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables, and any changes could have a considerable effect on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities. Impairments of Long Lived Assets In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, we monitor the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger events have occurred. These events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset. When a trigger event occurs, we perform an impairment calculation, comparing projected undiscounted cash flows, utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores, to the carrying value for those stores. If we identify impairment for long lived assets to be held and used, we compare the assets current carrying value to the assets fair value. Fair value is determined based on market values or discounted future cash flows. We record impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value. With respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal, we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions. We recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value, reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal. We recorded asset impairments in the normal course of business totaling $26 million in 2008, $24 million in 2007 and $61 million in 2006. We record costs to reduce the carrying value of long lived assets in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as Operating, general and administrative expense. The factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows. Our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation, the economy and market competition. Application of alternative assumptions and definitions, such as reviewing long lived assets for impairment at a different organizational level, could produce significantly different results. Goodwill We review goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, and also upon the occurrence of trigger events. We perform reviews at the operating division level. Generally, fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings, or discounted projected future cash flows, and we compare fair value to the carrying value of a division for purposes of identifying potential impairment. We base projected future cash flows on managements knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future. If we identify potential for impairment, we measure the fair value of a division against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities, excluding goodwill, to estimate an implied fair value of the divisions goodwill. We recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of the carrying value of the divisions goodwill over the implied fair value. If actual results differ significantly from anticipated future results for certain reporting units, we would need to recognize an impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of the divisions goodwill over the implied fair value. Results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during 2008, 2007 and 2006 are summarized in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 16 The annual impairment review requires the extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates. Application of alternative assumptions and definitions, such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different organizational level, could produce significantly different results. Similar to our policy on impairment of long lived assets, the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several items such as inflation, business valuations in the market, the economy and market competition. Store Closing Costs We provide for closed store liabilities relating to the present value of the estimated remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date, net of estimated subtenant income. We estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores. We usually pay closed store lease liabilities over the lease terms associated with the closed stores, which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to 20 years. Adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates. We make adjustments for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known. We review store closing liabilities quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs, or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose, is adjusted to earnings in the proper period. We estimate subtenant income, future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located, our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions. The ultimate cost of the disposition of the leases and the related assets is affected by current real estate markets, inflation rates and general economic conditions. We reduce owned stores held for disposal to their estimated net realizable value. We account for costs to reduce the carrying values of property, equipment and leasehold improvements in accordance with our policy on impairment of long lived assets. We classify inventory write downs in connection with store closings, if any, in Merchandise costs. We expense costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores as they are incurred. Post Retirement Benefit Plans (a) Company sponsored defined benefit Pension Plans We account for our defined benefit pension plans using the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 99, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS 158), which require the recognition of the funded status of retirement plans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We record, as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI), actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that have not yet been recognized. We adopted the measurement date provisions of SFAS 158 effective February 3, 2008. The majority of our pension and postretirement plans previously used a December 31 measurement date. All plans are now measured as of our fiscal year end. The non cash effect of the adoption of the measurement date provisions of SFAS 158 decreased shareowners equity by approximately $5 million ($3 million after tax) and increased long term liabilities by approximately $5 million. There was no effect on our results of operations. The determination of our obligation and expense for Company sponsored pension plans and other post retirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts. Those assumptions are described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and include, among others, the discount rate, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, average life expectancy and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions, including the discount rate used and the expected return on plan assets, may materially affect our pension and other post retirement obligations and our future expense. Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements discusses the effect of a 1% change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other post retirement benefit costs and the related liability. 17 The objective of our discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. In making this determination, we take into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans. Our methodology for selecting the discount rate as of year end 2008 was to match the plans cash flows to that of a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zero coupon corporate bonds for each maturity. Benefit cash flows due in a particular year can be settled theoretically by investing them in the zero coupon bond that matures in the same year. The discount rate is the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows. The selection of the 7.00% discount rate as of year end 2008 represents the equivalent single rate under a broad market AA yield curve constructed by an outside consultant. We utilized a discount rate of 6.50% for year end 2007. The 50 basis point increase in the discount rate decreased the projected pension benefit obligation as of January 31, 2009, by approximately $147 million. To determine the expected return on pension plan assets, we consider current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted returns on various asset categories. For 2008 and 2007, we assumed a pension plan investment return rate of 8.5%. Our pension plans average return was 4.1% for the 10 calendar years ended December 31, 2008, net of all investment management fees and expenses, primarily due to the poor performance of the financial markets in 2008. The value of all investments in our Company sponsored defined benefit pension plans during the calendar year ending December 31, 2008, net of investment management fees and expenses declined 26.1%. We believe our 8.5% pension return assumption is appropriate because we expect that future returns will achieve the same level of performances as the very long term historical average annual return (for example, the S&P 500 Index has returned 8.4% annually on a compound basis for the 20 years ending December 31, 2008) for the various markets in which the plan invests. We have been advised that during 2009, the trustees plan to increase the allocation of non core assets, including high yield debt securities, commodities and real estate. Collectively, these changes should improve the diversification of pension plan assets. The trustees have advised us that they expect these changes will have little effect on the total portfolio risk but will increase the likelihood of achieving the 8.5% expected rate of return. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the asset allocations of pension plan assets. Sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions used in the calculation of Krogers pension plan liabilities for the qualified plans is illustrated below (in millions). Percentage Point Change Projected Benefit Obligation Decrease/(Increase) Expense Decrease/(Increase) Discount Rate +/ 1.0 % $ 257/$(309 ) $ 13/$(28 ) Expected Return on Assets +/ 1.0 % $ 21/$(21 ) We contributed $20 million in 2008, $52 million in 2007 and $150 million in 2006 to our Company sponsored defined benefit pension plans. Although Kroger is not required to make cash contributions to its Company sponsored defined benefit pension plans during fiscal 2009, we made a $200 million cash contribution on February 2, 2009. Additional contributions may be made if required under the Pension Protection Act to avoid any benefit restrictions. We expect any voluntary contributions made during 2009 will reduce our minimum required contributions in future years. Among other things, investment performance of plan assets, the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations, and future changes in legislation, will determine the amounts of any additional contributions. Net periodic benefit cost decreased in 2008 and 2007 compared to 2006 due to participants in the Cash Balance formula of the Consolidated Retirement Benefit Plan being moved to a defined contribution 401(k) retirement savings account plan effective January 1, 2007. Participants under that formula continue to earn interest on prior contributions but no additional pay credits will be earned. The 401(k) retirement savings plan provides to eligible employees both matching contributions and automatic contributions from Kroger based on participant contributions, plan compensation, and length of service. We contributed and expensed $92 million in 2008 and $90 million in 2007 to employee 401(k) retirement savings accounts. (b) Multi Employer Plans We also contribute to various multi employer pension plans based on obligations arising from most of our collective bargaining agreements. These plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers. The benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose. Trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions. The trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans. 18 We recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded, in accordance with GAAP. We made contributions to these plans, and recognized expense, of $219 million in 2008, $207 million in 2007, and $204 million in 2006. Based on the most recent information available to us, we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most or all of these multi employer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits. We have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets, (i.e., the amount of underfunding), as of December 31, 2008. Because Kroger is only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans, we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of Krogers contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing Krogers share of the underfunding. Nonetheless, the underfunding is not a direct obligation or liability of Kroger or of any employer. As of December 31, 2008, we estimate that Krogers share of the underfunding of multi employer plans to which Kroger contributes was $3.0 billion, pre tax, or $1.9 billion, after tax. This represents an increase in the amount of underfunding estimated as of December 31, 2008, compared to December 31, 2007. The increase in the amount of underfunding is attributable to the recent market downturn. Our estimate is based on the best information available to us including actuarial evaluations and other data (that include the estimates of others), and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable. Our estimate is imprecise and not necessarily reliable. We have made and disclosed this estimate not because this underfunding is a direct liability of Kroger. Rather, we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences. In 2008, our contributions to these plans increased approximately 6% over the prior year and have grown at a compound annual rate of approximately 6% since 2004. We do not expect a significant increase in our contributions to multi employer pension plans in 2009, compared to 2008, subject to collective bargaining and capital market conditions. We believe our contributions to multi employer pension plans could as much as double over the next several years, after 2009, to reduce this underfunding. Finally, underfunding means that, in the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these funds, we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability. Any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated, in accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions. The amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and could change based on contract negotiations, returns on the assets held in the multi employer plans and benefit payments. The amount could decline, and Krogers future expense would be favorably affected, if the values of the assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining, trustee action or favorable legislation. On the other hand, Krogers share of the underfunding could increase and Krogers future expense could be adversely affected if the asset values decline, if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining, trustee action or adverse legislation. Deferred Rent We recognize rent holidays, including the time period during which we have access to the property for construction of buildings or improvements, as well as construction allowances and escalating rent provisions on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. The deferred amount is included in Other Current Liabilities and Other Long Term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Fair Value of Financial Instruments In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a market based framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 does not expand or require any new fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for financial assets and financial liabilities for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. FASB Staff Position (FSP) 157 2 Partial Deferral of the Effective Date of Statement No. 157 (FSP 157 2), deferred the effective date of SFAS 157 for most non financial assets and non financial liabilities to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. Effective February 3, 2008, we adopted SFAS 157, except for non financial assets and non financial liabilities which are deferred until February 1, 2009 by FSP 157 2. 19 SFAS 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy defined by SFAS 157 are as follows: Level 1 Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable; Level 3 Unobservable pricing inputs in which little or no market activity exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. For those financial instruments carried at fair value in the consolidated financial statements, the following table summarizes the fair value of these instruments at January 31, 2009: Fair Value Measurements Using (in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total Available for Sale Securities $ 11 $ $ $ 11 Variable Interest Entities In December 2008, the FASB issued FAS 140 4 and FIN 46(R) 8, Disclosures by Public Entities (Enterprises) about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable Interest Entities (FAS 140 4 and FIN 46(R) 8). FAS 140 4 and FIN 46(R) 8 require additional disclosures about an entitys involvement with variable interest entities and transfers of financial assets. Effective January 31, 2009, we adopted FAS 140 4 and FIN 46(R) 8. In the first quarter of 2008, we made an investment in The Little Clinic LLC (TLC). TLC operates supermarket walk in medical clinics in seven states, primarily in the Midwest and Southeast. At the date of investment, TLC was determined to be a variable interest entity (VIE) under FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R), with Kroger being the primary beneficiary. We were deemed the primary beneficiary due to our current ownership interest and half of our written put options being at a floor price. As a result, we consolidated TLC in accordance with FIN 46R. The minority interest was recorded at fair value on the acquisition date. The fair value of TLC was determined based on the amount of the investment made by Kroger and the percentage acquired. Our assessment of goodwill represents the excess of this amount over the fair value of TLCs net assets as of the investment date. Creditors of TLC have no recourse to the general credit of Kroger. Conversely, creditors of Kroger have no recourse to the assets of TLC. In addition, if requested by TLCs Board of Directors by January 1, 2010, we have agreed to make a pro rata portion of an additional capital contribution. 20 The table below shows the unaudited amounts of assets and liabilities from TLC included in our consolidated results, after eliminating intercompany items, as of January 31, 2009 (in millions of dollars): 2008 Current assets $ 31 Property, plant and equipment, net 7 Goodwill 102 Other assets 1 Total Assets $ 141 Current liabilities $ 4 Minority interests $ 82 In the fourth quarter of 2008, we became the primary beneficiary of i wireless, LLC a VIE in which we have a 25% ownership interest. We were deemed the primary beneficiary due to our current ownership interest, $25 million line of credit guarantee, and $8 million loan to i wireless, LLC. We became the primary beneficiary, in the fourth quarter of 2008, under FIN 46R after lending $8 million to i wireless, LLC. i wireless, LLC sells prepaid phones primarily in our stores. The minority interest was recorded at fair value. The fair value of i wireless, LLC was determined based on the amount of the investment made by Kroger in the fourth quarter of 2007 and the percentage acquired. Our assessment of goodwill represents the excess of this amount over the fair value of i wireless, LLC net assets as of the date of the loan. We have guaranteed the indebtedness of i wireless, LLC, up to $25 million, which is collateralized by $8 million of inventory located in our stores. The creditors of Kroger have no recourse to the assets of i wireless, LLC. The table below shows the preliminary and unaudited amounts of assets and liabilities from i wireless, LLC included in our consolidated results, after eliminating intercompany items, as of January 31, 2009 (in millions of dollars): 2008 Current assets $ 10 Property, plant and equipment, net 2 Goodwill 25 Other assets 5 Total Assets $ 42 Current liabilities $ 5 Long term debt $ 30 Minority interests $ 1 Share Based Compensation Expense We account for stock options under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)). Under this method, we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments granted after January 29, 2006, as well as all share based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of, January 29, 2006, in accordance with SFAS 123(R). Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R), we recognize share based compensation expense, net of an estimated forfeiture rate, over the requisite service period of the award. In addition, we account for restricted stock awards under SFAS 123(R). We record expense for restricted stock awards in an amount equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date of the award, over the period the awards lapse. 21 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (principally on a LIFO basis) or market. In total, approximately 98% in 2008 and 97% in 2007 of inventories were valued using the LIFO method. Cost for the balance of the inventories was determined using the FIFO method. Replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by $800 million at January 31, 2009, and by $604 million at February 2, 2008. We follow the Link Chain, Dollar Value LIFO method for purposes of calculating our LIFO charge or credit. We follow the item cost method of accounting to determine inventory cost before the LIFO adjustment for substantially all store inventories at our supermarket divisions. This method involves counting each item in inventory, assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs (net of vendor allowances and cash discounts) of each item and recording the cost of items sold. The item cost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory and purchasing levels when compared to the methodology followed under the retail method of accounting. We evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities. We record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date. Vendor Allowances We recognize all vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs when the related product is sold. In most cases, vendor allowances are applied to the related product by item, and therefore reduce the carrying value of inventory by item. When it is not practicable to allocate vendor allowances to the product by item, we recognize vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs based on inventory turns and as the product is sold. We recognized approximately $3.5 billion in 2008, $3.6 billion in 2007 and $3.3 billion in 2006 of vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs. We recognized more than 85% of all vendor allowances in the item cost with the remainder being based on inventory turns. 22 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flow Information Net cash provided by operating activities We generated $2.9 billion of cash from operations in 2008 compared to $2.6 billion in 2007 and $2.4 billion in 2006. The increase in cash generated from operating activities was primarily due to strong operating results adjusted for non cash expenses. In addition, changes in our operating assets and liabilities also affected the amount of cash provided by our operating activities. We realized decreases in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $411 million in 2008, $164 million in 2007 and $129 million in 2006. The increase in the change in operating assets and liabilities in 2008, compared to 2007, is primarily due to an increase in income taxes receivable. The increase in the change in operating assets and liabilities in 2007, compared to 2006, is primarily attributable to an increase in forward inventory buying activity. These amounts are also net of cash contributions to our Company sponsored defined benefit pension plans totaling $20 million in 2008, $52 million in 2007, and $150 in 2006. Net cash used by investing activities Cash used by investing activities was $2.2 billion in 2008, compared to $2.2 billion in 2007 and $1.6 billion in 2006. Our use of cash for investing activities was consistent in 2008, compared to 2007. The amount of cash used by investing activities increased in 2007, compared to 2006, due primarily to higher capital spending and payments for two acquisitions. Capital expenditures, including changes in construction in progress payables and excluding acquisitions, were $2.2 billion in 2008, $2.1 billion in 2007 and $1.8 billion in 2006. Refer to the Capital Expenditures section for an overview of our supermarket storing activity during the last three years. Net cash used by financing activities Financing activities used $769 million of cash in 2008 compared to $310 million in 2007 and $785 million in 2006. The increase in the amount of cash used in 2008, compared to 2007, was primarily a result of payments on long term debt and the bank revolver, offset by decreased stock repurchases. The decrease in the amount of cash used in 2007, compared to 2006, was primarily a result of proceeds received from the issuance of long term debt, offset by greater stock repurchases and dividends paid. We repurchased $637 million of Kroger stock in 2008 compared to $1.4 billion in 2007 and $633 million in 2006. We paid dividends totaling $227 million in 2008, $202 million in 2007and $140 million in 2006. Debt Management Total debt, including both the current and long term portions of capital leases and financing obligations, decreased $59 million to $8.1 billion as of year end 2008 from $8.1 billion as of year end 2007. The slight decrease in 2008, compared to 2007, resulted from the issuance of $400 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 5.00%, $375 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 6.90% and $600 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 7.50%, offset by decreased commercial paper, the payments on the bank revolver, the repayment of $200 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 6.375% and $750 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 7.45% that came due in 2008. Total debt increased to $8.1 billion as of year end 2007 from $7.1 billion as of year end 2006. The increases in 2007, compared to 2006, resulted from the issuance of $600 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 6.4%, $750 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 6.15% and borrowings under the bank credit facility in 2007, offset by the repayment of $200 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 7.65% and $300 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 7.80% that came due in 2007. Our total debt balances were also affected by our prefunding of employee benefit costs and by the mark to market adjustments necessary to record fair value interest rate hedges of our fixed rate debt, pursuant to SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Investments and Hedging Activities, as amended. We had prefunded employee benefit costs of $300 million in each of the three years ended 2008, 2007 and 2006. The mark to market adjustments increased the carrying value of our debt by $45 million in 2008 and $44 million in 2007. 23 Factors Affecting Liquidity We currently borrow on a daily basis approximately $250 million under our F2/P2/A3 rated commercial paper (CP) program. These borrowings are backed by our credit facility, and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility. We have capacity available under our credit facility to backstop all CP amounts outstanding. If our credit rating declines below its current level of BBB/ Baa2/BBB , the ability to borrow under our current CP program could be adversely affected for a period of time immediately following the reduction of our credit rating. This could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility, under which we believe we have sufficient capacity. However, in the event of a ratings decline, we do not anticipate that access to the CP markets currently available to us would be significantly limited for an extended period of time (i.e., in excess of 30 days). Although our ability to borrow under the credit facility is not affected by our credit rating, the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facility could be affected by a decrease in our credit rating or a decrease in our Applicable Percentage Ratio. Our credit facility also requires the maintenance of a Leverage Ratio and a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (our financial covenants). A failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facility. These financial covenants and ratios are described below: Our Applicable Percentage Ratio (the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Total Interest Expense, as defined in the credit facility) was 8.59 to 1 as of January 31, 2009. Our current borrowing rates are determined from the better of our Applicable Percentage Ratio or our credit ratings as defined by the credit facility. Our Leverage Ratio (the ratio of Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the credit facility) was 2.02 to 1 as of January 31, 2009. If this ratio exceeded 3.50 to 1, we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired. Our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA plus Consolidated Rental Expense to Consolidated Cash Interest Expense plus Consolidated Rental Expense, as defined in the credit facility) was 4.12 to 1 as of January 31, 2009. If this ratio fell below 1.70 to 1, we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired. Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in our credit facility, includes an adjustment for unusual gains and losses. Our credit agreement is more fully described in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We were in compliance with our financial covenants at year end 2008. 24 The tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments, based on year of maturity or settlement, as of January 31, 2009 (in millions of dollars): 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations(1) (2) Long term debt (5) $ 528 $ 542 $ 544 $ 1,414 $ 1,019 $ 3,550 $ 7,597 Interest on long term debt (3) 479 426 398 350 286 2,442 4,381 Capital lease obligations 53 51 57 48 45 219 473 Operating lease obligations 778 738 674 624 575 3,274 6,663 Low income housing obligations 2 2 Financed lease obligations 13 13 13 13 13 172 237 Self insurance liability (4) 192 110 73 45 26 22 468 Construction commitments 128 128 Purchase obligations 394 87 63 51 28 19 642 Total $ 2,567 $ 1,967 $ 1,822 $ 2,545 $ 1,992 $ 9,698 $ 20,591 Other Commercial Commitments Credit facility(5) $ 129 $ $ $ $ $ $ 129 Standby letters of credit 344 344 Surety bonds 106 106 Guarantees 27 27 Total $ 606 $ $ $ $ $ $ 606 (1) The contractual obligations table excludes funding of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, which totaled approximately $45 million in 2008. This table also excludes contributions under various multi employer pension plans, which totaled $219 million in 2008. (2) We adopted FIN 48 on February 4, 2007. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the adoption of FIN 48. The liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing of future tax settlements cannot be determined. (3) Amounts include contractual interest payments using the interest rate as of January 31, 2009 applicable to our variable interest debt instruments, excluding commercial paper borrowings due to the short term nature of these borrowings, and stated fixed and swapped interest rates, if applicable, for all other debt instruments. (4) The amounts included in the contractual obligations table for self insurance liability have been stated on a present value basis. (5) Long term debt includes amounts under our credit facility which are also included in the Other Commercial Commitments table. Our construction commitments include funds owed to third parties for projects currently under construction. These amounts are reflected in other current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our purchase obligations include commitments to be utilized in the normal course of business, such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our manufacturing plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and manufacturing facilities. Our obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties. Any upfront vendor allowances or incentives associated with outstanding purchase commitments are recorded as either current or long term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of January 31, 2009, we maintained a $2.5 billion, five year revolving credit facility that, unless extended, terminates in 2011. Outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and commercial paper borrowings, and some outstanding letters of credit, reduce funds available under the credit agreement. In addition to the credit agreement, we maintained three uncommitted money market lines totaling $75 million in the aggregate. The money market lines allow us to borrow from banks at mutually agreed upon rates, usually at rates below the rates offered under the credit agreement. As of January 31, 2009, we had no borrowings under our credit agreement and net outstanding commercial paper of $90 million, that reduced amounts available under our credit agreement. In addition, as of January 31, 2009, we had borrowings under our money market lines totaling $39 million. The outstanding letters of credit that reduce funds available under our credit agreement totaled $337 million as of January 31, 2009. 25 In addition to the available credit mentioned above, as of January 31, 2009, we had authorized for issuance $1.4 billion of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC and effective on December 20, 2007. We also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our self insured workers compensation claims. These bonds are required by most states in which we are self insured for workers compensation and are placed with third party insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to meet our claim payment obligations up to our self insured retention levels. These bonds do not represent liabilities of Kroger, as we already have reserves on our books for the claims costs. Market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and, in some instances, availability of these bonds may become more limited, which could affect our costs of, or access to, such bonds. Although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly affect our ability to access these surety bonds, if this does become an issue, we would issue letters of credit, in states where allowed, against our credit facility to meet the state bonding requirements. This could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facility. Most of our outstanding public debt is jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed by The Kroger Co. and some of our subsidiaries. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of those arrangements. In addition, we have guaranteed half of the indebtedness of two real estate entities in which we have 50% ownership interest. Our share of the responsibility for this indebtedness, should the entities be unable to meet their obligations, totals approximately $7 million. Based on the covenants underlying this indebtedness as of January 31, 2009, it is unlikely that we will be responsible for repayment of these obligations. We have also agreed to guarantee, up to $25 million, the indebtedness of an entity of which we have 25% ownership interest. Our share of the responsibility, as of January 31, 2009, should the entity be unable to meet its obligations, totals approximately $25 million and is collateralized by approximately $8 million of inventory located in our stores. In addition, we have guaranteed half of the lease payments of a location leased by an entity in which we have a 50% ownership interest. The net present value of the guaranteed rental payments is approximately $6 million. We also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions. We could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations. Due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties, and various other remedies available to us, we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote. We have agreed to indemnify certain third party logistics operators for certain expenses, including pension trust fund contribution obligations and withdrawal liabilities. In addition to the above, we enter into various indemnification agreements and take on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business. Such arrangements include indemnities against third party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to Kroger; indemnities related to the sale of our securities; indemnities of directors, officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work; and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans. While Krogers aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability, we are not aware of any current matter that could result in a material liability. RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Effective January 31, 2009, we adopted FAS 140 4 and FIN 46(R) 8, Disclosures by Public Entities (Enterprises) about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable Interest Entities (FAS 140 4 and FIN 46(R) 8). FAS 140 4 and FIN 46(R) 8 require additional disclosures about an entitys involvement with variable interest entities and transfers of financial assets. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the adoption of FAS 140 4 and FIN 46(R) 8. Effective February 3, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), except for non financial assets and non financial liabilities as deferred until February 1, 2009 by FASB Staff Position (FSP) 157 2 Partial Deferral of the Effective Date of Statement No. 157 (FSP 157 2). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a market based framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 does not expand or require any new fair value measurements. FSP 157 2 deferred the effective date of SFAS 157 for most non financial assets and non financial liabilities to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the adoption of SFAS 157. 26 Effective February 4, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN No. 48), which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the adoption of FIN No. 48. Effective February 3, 2007, we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions (except for the measurement date change) of SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statement No. 87, 99, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS 158), which requires the recognition of the funded status of our retirement plans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that have not yet been recognized are required to be recorded as a component of AOCI. We adopted the measurement date provisions of SFAS 158 effective February 3, 2008. The majority of our pension and postretirement plans previously used a December 31 measurement date. All plans are now measured as of our fiscal year end. The non cash effect of the adoption of the measurement date provisions of SFAS 158 decreased shareowners equity by approximately $5 million ($3 million after tax) and increased long term liabilities by approximately $5 million. There was no effect on our results of operations. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the adoption of this standard. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 will require the consolidation of noncontrolling interests as a component of equity. SFAS 160 will become effective for our fiscal year beginning February 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the effect the adoption of SFAS 160 will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (Revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141R), which replaces SFAS No. 141. SFAS 141R further expands the definitions of a business and the fair value measurement and reporting in a business combination. SFAS 141R will become effective for our fiscal year beginning February 1, 2009. Because the standard will only impact transactions entered into after February 1, 2009, SFAS 141R will not effect our Consolidated Financial Statements upon adoption. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 requires enhanced disclosures of an entitys derivative and hedging activities. SFAS 161 will become effective for our fiscal year beginning February 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the effect the adoption of SFAS 161 will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP No. EITF 03 6 1). FSP No. EITF 03 6 1 clarifies that share based payment awards that entitle their holders to receive nonforfeitable dividends before vesting should be considered participating securities and included in the calculation of basic EPS. FSP No. EITF 03 6 1 will become effective for our fiscal year beginning February 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the effect the adoption of FSP No. EITF 03 6 1 will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 27 OUTLOOK This discussion and analysis contains certain forward looking statements about Krogers future performance. These statements are based on managements assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available. Such statements relate to, among other things: projected change in net earnings; identical sales growth; expected pension plan contributions; our ability to generate operating cash flow; projected capital expenditures; square footage growth; opportunities to reduce costs; cash flow requirements; and our operating plan for the future; and are indicated by words such as comfortable, committed, will, expect, goal, should, intend, target, believe, anticipate, and similar words or phrases. These forward looking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations, projections, beliefs, intentions or strategies are forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21 E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. While we believe that the statements are accurate, uncertainties about the general economy, our labor relations, our ability to execute our plans on a timely basis and other uncertainties described below could cause actual results to differ materially. We expect earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.00 $2.05 for 2009. This represents earnings per share growth of approximately 4% 7% in 2009, excluding the $0.02 per diluted share charge in 2008 related to Hurricane Ike. In addition, our shareholder return is enhanced by our dividend by over 1%. We expect identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel sales, of 3% 4% in 2009, assuming product cost inflation of 1% 2%. In 2009, we will continue to focus on driving sales growth and balancing investments in gross margin and improved customer service to provide a better shopping experience for our customers. We expect to finance these investments with operating cost reductions. We expect non fuel operating margins to improve slightly in 2009, excluding the benefit of an expected lower LIFO charge. In 2009, we expect fuel margins to be approximately $0.11 per gallon, as well as continued strong growth in gallons sold. In 2009, we expect the LIFO charge to be $75 million, assuming product cost inflation of 1% 2%. We plan to use cash flow primarily for capital investments, debt reduction and to pay cash dividends. As market conditions change, we plan to re evaluate the above uses of cash flow and our stock repurchase activity. We expect to obtain sales growth from new square footage, as well as from increased productivity from existing locations. Capital expenditures reflect our strategy of growth through expansion, as well as focusing on productivity increase from our existing store base through remodels. In addition, we will continue our emphasis on self development and ownership of real estate, logistics and technology improvements. The continued capital spending in technology is focused on improving store operations, logistics, manufacturing procurement, category management, merchandising and buying practices, and should reduce merchandising costs. We intend to continue using cash flow from operations to finance capital expenditure requirements. We expect capital investment for 2009 to be in the range of $1.9 $2.1 billion, excluding acquisitions. Total food store square footage is expected to grow approximately1.5% 2.0% before acquisitions and operational closings. Based on current operating trends, we believe that cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity, including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility, will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, interest payments and scheduled principal payments for the foreseeable future. We also believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to respond effectively to competitive conditions. We believe we have adequate sources of cash if needed under our credit agreement. 28 We expect that our OG&A results will be affected by increased costs, such as higher pension costs and credit card fees, as well as any potential future labor disputes, offset by improved productivity from process changes and leverage gained through sales increases. We expect that our effective tax rate for 2009 will be approximately 37%. We expect rent expense, as a percent of total sales and excluding closed store activity, will decrease due to the emphasis our current strategy places on ownership of real estate. We believe that in 2009 there will be opportunities to reduce our operating costs in such areas as administration, productivity improvements, shrink, warehousing and transportation. These savings will be invested in our core business to drive profitable sales growth and offer improved value and shopping experiences for our customers. Although we were not required to make cash contributions to Company sponsored defined benefit pension plans during 2008 and do not anticipate being required to do so in 2009, we contributed $20 million to these plans in 2008 and we made a $200 million contribution in 2009 on February 2, 2009. We expect any elective contributions made during 2009 will decrease our required contributions in future years. Among other things, investment performance of plan assets, the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations, and future changes in legislation, will determine the amounts of any additional contributions. We also expect 2009 expense for Company sponsored defined benefit pension plans to be comparable to 2008. In addition, we expect our cash contributions and expense to the 401(k) Retirement Savings Account Plan from automatic and matching contributions to participants to increase in 2009, compared to 2008. We do not expect a significant increase in our contributions to multi employer pension plans in 2009 compared to 2008 subject to collective bargaining and capital market conditions. In addition, we believe our contributions to multi employer pension plans could as much as double over the next several years after 2009. We expect our expense from the credit extended to our customers through our company branded credit card in 2009 to be comparable to 2008 of $14 million. The 2008 expense represents an increase in net charge offs of approximately $8 million, compared to 2007, due to the weak economy, higher outstanding balances, and portfolio maturation. This rate is still below the credit card industry average and the credit portfolio continues to have an above average credit score. Various uncertainties and other factors could cause us to fail to achieve our goals. These include: The extent to which our sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet our requirements may be affected by the state of the financial markets and the impact that such condition has on our ability to issue commercial paper at acceptable rates. Our ability to borrow under our committed lines of credit, including our bank credit facilities, could be impaired if one or more of our lenders under those lines is unwilling or unable to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us. We have various labor agreements that will be negotiated in 2009, covering associates in Albuquerque, Arizona, Atlanta, Dallas, Dayton, Denver and Portland. In all of these store contracts, rising health care and pension costs will continue to be an important issue in negotiations. A prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material effect on our results. If market conditions change, it could affect our uses of cash flow. Our ability to achieve sales and earnings goals may be affected by: labor disputes; industry consolidation; pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors, including non traditional competitors; our response to these actions; the state of the economy, including the inflationary and deflationary trends in certain commodities; trends in consumer spending; stock repurchases; and the success of our future growth plans. Our estimate of product cost inflation could be affected by general economic conditions, weather, availability of raw materials and ingredients in the products that we sell and their packaging, and other factors beyond our control. The timing of our recognition of LIFO expense will be affected primarily by expected food inflation during the year. If actual results differ significantly from anticipated future results for certain reporting units and variable interest entities, an impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of the divisions goodwill over the implied fair value would need to be recognized. 29 In addition to the factors identified above, our identical store sales growth could be affected by increases in Kroger private label sales, the effect of our sister stores (new stores opened in close proximity to an existing store) and reductions in retail pricing. Our operating margins, without fuel, could fail to slightly improve as expected if we are unable to pass on any cost increases, fail to deliver the cost savings contemplated or if changes in the cost of our inventory and the timing of those changes differs from our expectations. Our expected operating margin per gallon of fuel and fuel gallons sold could be affected by changes in the price of fuel or a change in our operating costs. We have estimated our exposure to the claims and litigation arising in the normal course of business, as well as to the material litigation facing Kroger, and believe we have made adequate provisions for them where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where we believe an adverse outcome is probable. Unexpected outcomes in these matters, however, could result in an adverse effect on our earnings. Consolidation in the food industry is likely to continue and the effects on our business, either favorable or unfavorable, cannot be foreseen. Rent expense, which includes subtenant rental income, could be adversely affected by the state of the economy, increased store closure activity and future consolidation. Depreciation expense, which includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital leases, is computed principally using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of individual assets, or the remaining terms of leases. Use of the straight line method of depreciation creates a risk that future asset write offs or potential impairment charges related to store closings would be larger than if an accelerated method of depreciation was followed. Our effective tax rate may differ from the expected rate due to changes in laws, the status of pending items with various taxing authorities and the deductibility of certain expenses. The actual amount of automatic and matching cash contributions to our 401(k) Retirement Savings Account Plan will depend on the number of participants, savings rate, plan compensation, and length of service of participants. Our contributions and recorded expense related to multi employer pension funds could increase more than anticipated. Should asset values in these funds further deteriorate, if employers withdraw from these funds without providing for their share of the liability, or should our estimates prove to be understated, our contributions could increase more rapidly than we have anticipated, after 2009. If weakness in the financial markets continues or worsens, our contributions to Company sponsored defined benefit pension plans could increase more than anticipated. Changes in laws or regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements and environmental laws may have a material effect on our financial statements. Changes in the general business and economic conditions in our operating regions, including the rate of inflation, population growth and employment and job growth in the markets in which we operate, may affect our ability to hire and train qualified employees to operate our stores. This would negatively affect earnings and sales growth. General economic changes may also affect the shopping habits of our customers, which could affect sales and earnings. Changes in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial indicators. For example, we continue to add supermarket fuel centers to our store base. Since gasoline generates low profit margins, we expect to see our FIFO gross profit margins decline as gasoline sales increase. Although this negatively affects our FIFO gross margin, gasoline sales provide a positive effect on OG&A expense as a percent of sales. 30 Our capital expenditures, expected square footage growth, and number of store projects completed during the year could differ from our estimate if we are unsuccessful in acquiring suitable sites for new stores, if development costs vary from those budgeted or if our logistics and technology projects are not completed in the time frame expected or on budget. Interest expense could be adversely affected by the interest rate environment, changes in the Companys credit ratings, fluctuations in the amount of outstanding debt, decisions to incur prepayment penalties on the early redemption of debt and any factor that adversely affects our operations and results in an increase in debt. Impairment losses could be affected by changes in our assumptions of future cash flows or market values. Our cash flow projections include several years of projected cash flows and include assumptions on variables such as inflation, the economy and market competition. Our estimated expense and obligation for Company sponsored pension plans and other post retirement benefits could be affected by changes in the assumptions used in calculating those amounts. These assumptions include, among others, the discount rate, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, average life expectancy and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs. Adverse weather conditions could increase the cost our suppliers charge for their products, or may decrease the customer demand for certain products. Increases in demand for certain commodities could also increase the cost our suppliers charge for their products. Additionally, increases in the cost of inputs, such as utility costs or raw material costs, could negatively affect financial ratios and earnings. Although we presently operate only in the United States, civil unrest in foreign countries in which our suppliers do business may affect the prices we are charged for imported goods. If we are unable to pass on these increases to our customers, our FIFO gross margin and net earnings will suffer. Other factors and assumptions not identified above could also cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking information. Accordingly, actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in, contemplated or implied by forward looking statements made by us or our representatives. 31 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Financial Risk Management We use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. As a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure. Because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure, fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure. The interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets. We manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of variable and fixed rate debt, and interest rate swaps. Our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. To do this, we use the following guidelines: (i) use average daily outstanding borrowings to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure, (ii) limit the average annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of $2.5 billion or less, (iii) include no leveraged products, and (iv) hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current mark to market status. As of January 31, 2009, we did not have any outstanding interest rate swaps designated as fair value or cash flow hedges. In 2008, we terminated nine fair value interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $900 million. Three of these terminated interest rate swaps were purchased and became ineffective fair value hedges in 2008. The proceeds received at termination were credited to interest expense in the amount of $15 million. We have unamortized proceeds from twelve interest rate swaps once classified as fair value hedges totaling approximately $45 million. The unamortized proceeds are recorded as adjustments to the carrying values of the underlying debt and are being amortized over the remaining term of the debt. In addition to the interest rate swaps noted above, in 2005 we entered into three forward starting interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount totaling $750 million. A forward starting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges future benchmark interest rates on debt for an established period of time. We entered into the forward starting interest rate swaps in order to lock into fixed interest rates on forecasted issuances of debt in 2007 and 2008. In 2007, we terminated two of these forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $500 million. In 2008, we terminated the remaining forward interest rate swap with a notional amount of $250 million. The unamortized payments and proceeds on these terminated forward starting interest rate swaps have been recorded net of tax in other comprehensive income and will be amortized to earnings as the payments of interest to which the hedge relates are made. As of February 2, 2008, other long term liabilities totaling $18 million were recorded to reflect the fair value of these agreements. Annually, we review with the Financial Policy Committee of our Board of Directors compliance with the guidelines. The guidelines may change as our business needs dictate. The table below provides information about our underlying debt portfolio as of January 31, 2009. The amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of long term debt, excluding capital leases as of January 31, 2009. Interest rates reflect the weighted average rate for the outstanding instruments. The variable component of each variable rate debt is based on the U.S. dollar LIBOR using the forward yield curve as of January 31, 2009. The Fair Value column includes the fair value of our debt instruments as of January 31, 2009. Refer to Notes 5, 6 and 7 of our Consolidated Financial Statements: Expected Year of Maturity 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Fair Value (In millions) Debt Fixed rate $ (384 ) $ (535 ) $ (490 ) $ (1,359 ) $ (1,008 ) $ (3,538 ) $ (7,314 ) $ (7,637 ) Average interest rate 6.78 % 6.67 % 6.57 % 6.61 % 6.68 % 6.77 % Variable rate $ (144 ) $ (7 ) $ (54 ) $ (55 ) $ (11 ) $ (12 ) $ (283 ) $ (283 ) Average interest rate 2.27 % 5.14 % 4.35 % 7.27 % 7.72 % 8.10 % 32 Commodity Price Protection We enter into purchase commitments for various resources, including raw materials utilized in our manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in our stores, warehouses, manufacturing facilities and administrative offices. We enter into commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of normal business. Those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in the normal course of business qualify as normal purchases. Some of the product we purchase is shipped in corrugated cardboard packaging. We sell corrugated cardboard when it is economical to do so. As of January 31, 2009, we maintained a derivative instrument to manage exposure to changes in corrugated cardboard prices. This derivative has a three year term. The instrument does not qualify for hedge accounting, in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Investments and Hedging Activities, as amended. Accordingly, the change in the fair value of this instrument is marked to market in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in OG&A expenses. As of January 31, 2009, the fair value of this instrument was insignificant. 33
