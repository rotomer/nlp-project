ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OUR BUSINESS The Kroger Co. was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902. It is one of the nations largest retailers, as measured by revenue, operating 2,468 supermarket and multi department stores under two dozen banners including Kroger, Ralphs, Fred Meyer, Food 4 Less, King Soopers, Smiths, Frys, Frys Marketplace, Dillons, QFC and City Market. Of these stores, 893 have fuel centers. We also operate 777 convenience stores and 374 fine jewelry stores. Kroger operates 40 manufacturing plants, primarily bakeries and dairies, which supply approximately 39% of the corporate brand units sold in our retail outlets. Our revenues are earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores. We earn income predominately by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of the costs we incur to make these products available to our customers. Such costs include procurement and distribution costs, facility occupancy and operational costs, and overhead expenses. Our operations are reported as a single reportable segment: the retail sale of merchandise to individual customers. OUR 2009 PERFORMANCE By focusing on the customer through our Customer 1st strategy, we were able to report solid results in 2009 (excluding the non cash asset impairment charges totaling $1.14 billion, pre tax ($1.05 billion, after tax), related to our division in southern California) during what continues to be a difficult operating environment. In 2009, our identical supermarket sales increased 2.1%, excluding fuel. Our 2009 earnings were $0.11 per diluted share or $1.71 per diluted share, excluding the non cash asset impairment charges referred to above. We did not achieve our original goals for identical supermarket sales growth of 3% to 4% and earnings per share of $2.00 to $2.05 per diluted share, as cautious consumers, significant deflation, and intense competition affected margins and sales growth. Nonetheless, we strengthened our overall competitive position by increasing the number of households that are loyal to Kroger and we are earning a greater share of their business. As a result, we continue to generate tonnage growth in both perishable and non perishable categories that is among the strongest in the industry. Sustainable identical sales and earnings growth remains one of our key long term objectives. We continue to widen the gap between our identical supermarkets sales growth trends and those of several of our competitors. We believe this has extremely positive implications for our associates, customers and shareholders now and as we grow our business in the future. Market share is an important part of our long term strategy. Market share is important to us because it allows us to leverage the fixed costs in our business over a wider revenue base. Our fundamental operating philosophy is to maintain and increase market share. Based on Nielsen Homescan Data, our estimated market share increased in total by approximately 60 basis points in 2009 across the 17 divisions in which we operate. Nielsen Homescan Data includes scanned products across many retail channels, not including restaurants. This information also indicates that our market share increased in 13 of the divisions, declined in three, and remained unchanged in one. These market share results are consistent with our long term strategy. 11 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion summarizes our operating results for 2009 compared to 2008 and for 2008 compared to 2007. Comparability is affected by income and expense items that fluctuated significantly between and among the periods. Net Earnings Net earnings totaled $70 million for 2009, compared to net earnings totaling $1.2 billion in each of 2008 and 2007. The net earnings for 2009 include non cash asset impairment charges totaling $1.05 billion, after tax, related to a division in southern California (the non cash impairment charges). The impairment primarily resulted from the write off of the Ralphs division goodwill balance. Excluding these impairment charges, adjusted net earnings for the year would have been $1.1 billion. Additionally, the decrease in net earnings for 2009, compared to 2008, resulted from lower retail fuel margins and decreased operating profit, partially offset by a LIFO charge of $49 million pre tax, compared to a LIFO charge of $196 million pre tax in 2008. 2008 net earnings also included after tax costs of $16 million from disruption and damage caused by Hurricane Ike. The slight increase in our net earnings for 2008, compared to 2007, resulted from strong non fuel identical supermarket sales growth and strong fuel results. Management believes adjusted net earnings (and adjusted earnings per share) in 2009 are useful metrics to investors and analysts because impairment charges are non recurring, non cash charges that are not directly related to our day to day business. We also excluded these charges from our incentive plan calculations for the year. 2009 earnings per diluted share totaled $0.11 and 2009 adjusted earnings per diluted share totaled $1.71, compared to $1.89 in 2008, or $1.91, excluding the $.02 per diluted share for costs for damage and disruption caused by Hurricane Ike, and $1.73 in 2007. The decline in adjusted net earnings per share in 2009, compared to 2008, resulted from lower retail fuel margins and decreased operating profit, partially offset by lower LIFO charges and after tax costs of $16 million from disruption and damage caused by Hurricane Ike in 2008. Our earnings per share growth in 2008, compared to 2007, resulted from increased net earnings, strong identical sales growth and the repurchase of Kroger stock. Sales Total Sales (in millions) 2009 Percentage Increase 2008 Percentage Increase 2007 Total supermarket sales without fuel $ 65,649 2.9 % $ 63,795 6.1 % $ 60,142 Total supermarket fuel sales 6,671 (10.6 )% 7,464 30.0 % 5,741 Total supermarket sales $ 72,320 1.5 % $ 71,259 8.2 % $ 65,883 Other sales(1) 4,413 (9.7 )% 4,889 9.8 % 4,453 Total sales $ 76,733 0.8 % $ 76,148 8.3 % $ 70,336 (1) Other sales primarily relate to sales at convenience stores, including fuel, jewelry stores, sales by our manufacturing plants to outside customers, and variable interest entities. The slight increase in total sales and the decrease in other sales and total supermarket fuel sales for 2009 compared to 2008 was attributable to the year over year decline in retail fuel prices. The change in our total supermarket sales without fuel for 2009 over 2008 was primarily the result of increases in identical supermarket sales and retail square footage. Identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, increased due to increased transaction count offset partially by a lower average sale per shopping trip. We define a supermarket as identical when it has been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters. Fuel center discounts received at our fuel centers and earned based on in store purchases are included in all of the supermarket identical sales results calculations illustrated below. Differences between total supermarket sales and identical supermarket sales primarily relate to changes in supermarket square footage. Identical supermarket sales include all sales at identical Fred Meyer multi department stores. We calculate annualized identical supermarket sales by adding together four quarters of identical supermarket sales. Our identical supermarket sales results are summarized in the table below, based on the 52 week period of 2009, compared to the 52 week period of the previous year. The identical store count in the table below represents the total number of identical supermarkets as of January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009. 12 Identical Supermarket Sales (dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Including supermarket fuel centers $ 68,981 $ 68,600 Excluding supermarket fuel centers $ 62,734 $ 61,414 Including supermarket fuel centers 0.6 % 6.9 % Excluding supermarket fuel centers 2.1 % 5.0 % Identical 4th Quarter store count 2,325 2,369 We define a supermarket as comparable when it has been in operation for five full quarters, including expansions and relocations. As is the case for identical supermarket sales, fuel center discounts received at our fuel centers and earned based on in store purchases are included in all of the supermarket comparable sales results calculations illustrated below. Comparable supermarket sales include all sales at comparable Fred Meyer multi department stores. We calculate annualized comparable supermarket sales by adding together four quarters of comparable sales. Our annualized comparable supermarket sales results are summarized in the table below, based on the 52 week period of 2009, compared to the same 52 week period of the previous year. The comparable store count in the table below represents the total number of comparable supermarkets as of January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009. Comparable Supermarket Sales (dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Including supermarket fuel centers $ 71,346 $ 70,722 Excluding supermarket fuel centers $ 64,838 $ 63,280 Including supermarket fuel centers 0.9 % 7.2 % Excluding supermarket fuel centers 2.5 % 5.3 % Comparable 4th Quarter store count 2,386 2,444 FIFO Gross Margin We calculate First In, First Out (FIFO) Gross Margin as sales minus merchandise costs, including advertising, warehousing and transportation, but excluding the Last In, First Out (LIFO) charge. Merchandise costs exclude depreciation and rent expense. FIFO gross margin is an important measure used by management to evaluate merchandising and operational effectiveness. Our FIFO gross margin rates, as a percentage of sales, were 23.23% in 2009, 23.38% in 2008 and 23.86% in 2007. Our retail fuel sales reduce our FIFO gross margin rate due to the very low FIFO gross margin on retail fuel sales as compared to non fuel sales. Excluding the effect of retail fuel operations, our FIFO gross margin rates decreased 58 basis points in 2009 and 19 basis points in 2008. The decrease in our non fuel FIFO gross margin rate since 2007 reflects our continued investments in our Customer 1st strategy. In addition, FIFO gross margin in 2009, compared to 2008, decreased due to heightened competitive activity and deflation, partially offset by improvements in shrink, advertising, and warehousing and transportation expenses, as a percentage of sales. LIFO Charge The LIFO charge was $49 million in 2009, $196 million in 2008 and $108 million in 2007. The LIFO charge in 2009, compared to 2008, decreased primarily due to a decrease in annualized product cost inflation for those categories of inventory on the LIFO method of valuation for 2009 compared to 2008. The last three quarters of 2009 experienced product cost deflation, excluding fuel. In 2009, our LIFO charge primarily resulted from product cost inflation related to tobacco products and pharmacy. An increase in product cost inflation caused the increase in the LIFO charge in 2008, compared to 2007. We revised our 2007 LIFO charge by $46 million pre tax ($29 million after tax). This revision was made to account for certain promotional allowances in our LIFO indices in 2007. We believe this adjustment is not material to any individual year or any quarterly period within such years presented. See footnote 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Operating, General and Administrative Expenses Operating, general and administrative (OG&A) expenses consist primarily of employee related costs such as wages, health care benefit costs and retirement plan costs, utilities and credit card fees. Rent expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and interest expense are not included in OG&A. 13 OG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 17.46% in 2009, 17.14% in 2008 and 17.44% in 2007. The growth in our retail fuel sales reduces our OG&A rate due to the very low OG&A rate on retail fuel sales as compared to non fuel sales. OG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales excluding fuel, decreased 3 basis points in 2009, compared to 2008. OG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales excluding fuel and the effect of Hurricane Ike in 2008, decreased 3 basis points in 2008, compared to 2007. The 2009 decrease, compared to 2008, resulted primarily from increased supermarket identical sales growth, a reduction in bag expense, lower incentive compensation, and reduced utility costs. These improvements were partially offset by increases in credit card fees, health care costs, and wages. Wage expenses have increased due to increased hours worked and lower employee turnover, in the current economic environment, which has resulted in increased average hourly wages. The decrease in our OG&A rate in 2008, excluding the effect of retail fuel and the effect of Hurricane Ike in 2008, compared to 2007, was primarily the result of increased identical supermarkets sales growth and a settlement received from credit card processers, partially offset by increases in credit card fees and health care costs. Rent Expense Rent expense was $648 million in 2009, as compared to $659 million in 2008 and $643 million in 2007. Rent expense, as a percentage of sales, was 0.84% in 2009, as compared to 0.87% in 2008 and 0.91% in 2007. The decrease in rent expense, as a percentage of sales, reflects our continued emphasis on owning rather than leasing, whenever possible. Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense was $1.5 billion in 2009 and $1.4 billion in 2008 and 2007. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2009, compared to 2008 and 2007, was the result of additional depreciation on capital expenditures, including prior acquisitions and the prior purchase of leased facilities, totaling $2.4 billion in 2009, $2.2 billion in 2008 and $2.1 billion in 2007. Depreciation and amortization expense, as a percentage of sales, was 1.99% in 2009, 1.89% in 2008 and 1.93% in 2007. The increase in our depreciation and amortization expense in 2009, compared to 2008, as a percentage of sales, is primarily due to increased depreciation expense, and a slower growth rate in sales due to heightened competitive activity, deflation and year over year decline in retail fuel prices. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in 2008, compared to 2007, as a percentage of sales, is primarily the result of increasing sales. Interest Expense Net interest expense totaled $502 million in 2009, $485 million in 2008 and $474 million in 2007. The increase in interest expense in 2009, compared to 2008, resulted primarily from a higher weighted average interest rate and a reduction in interest income, offset partially by our benefit from interest rate swaps. The increase in interest expense in 2008, compared to 2007, was primarily the result of an increase in the average total debt balance for the year, partially offset by interest income related to the mark to market of ineffective fair value swaps. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 90.4% in 2009, 36.5% in 2008 and 35.2% in 2007. The 2009 effective income tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge being mostly non deductible for tax purposes. Excluding the non cash impairment charges, our effective rate in 2009 was 35.8%. The 2008 and 2007 effective tax rates differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state income taxes. In addition, the effective tax rates for 2009 and 2007 differ from the expected federal statutory rate due to the resolution of some tax issues with the taxing authorities. COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM We maintain stock repurchase programs that comply with Securities Exchange Act Rule 10b5 1 and allow for the orderly repurchase of our common stock, from time to time. We made open market purchases of Kroger stock totaling $156 million in 2009, $448 million in 2008 and $1.2 billion in 2007 under these repurchase programs. In addition to these repurchase programs, in December 1999 we began a program to repurchase common stock to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans. This program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises, and the tax benefit from these exercises. We repurchased approximately $62 million in 2009, $189 million in 2008 and $270 million in 2007 of Kroger stock under the stock option program. In 2009 and 2008, to preserve liquidity and financial flexibility, we reduced the amount of stock repurchased during the year, decreasing the cash used for stock purchases in 2009 and 2008, compared to 2007. 14 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Capital expenditures, including changes in construction in progress payables and excluding acquisitions and the purchase of leased facilities, totaled $2.2 billion in 2009 compared to $2.1 billion in 2008 and 2007. The increase in capital spending in 2009 compared to 2008 and 2007 was the result of increasing our focus on merchandising and productivity projects. During 2009, capital expenditures for the purchase of leased facilities totaled $164 million compared to $27 million for 2008. This increase was due to Kroger purchasing several previously leased retail stores, one office building and one distribution center at very attractive rates during 2009. The table below shows our supermarket storing activity and our total food store square footage: Supermarket Storing Activity 2009 2008 2007 Beginning of year 2,481 2,486 2,468 Opened 14 21 23 Opened (relocation) 9 14 9 Acquired 6 38 Acquired (relocation) 1 3 1 Closed (operational) (27 ) (32 ) (43 ) Closed (relocation) (10 ) (17 ) (10 ) End of year 2,468 2,481 2,486 Total food store square footage (in millions) 148 147 145 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position, and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Self Insurance Costs We primarily are self insured for costs related to workers compensation and general liability claims. The liabilities represent our best estimate, using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods, of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through January 30, 2010. We establish case reserves for reported claims using case basis evaluation of the underlying claim data and we update as information becomes known. For both workers compensation and general liability claims, we have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis. We are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits. We account for the liabilities for workers compensation claims on a present value basis utilizing a risk adjusted discount rate. A 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase our liability by approximately $5 million. General liability claims are not discounted. We are also similarly self insured for property related losses. We have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to losses in excess of $25 million on a per claim basis, except in the case of an earthquake, for which stop loss coverage is in excess of $50 million per claim, up to $200 million per claim in California and $300 million outside of California. 15 The assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability, which can affect the liability recorded for such claims. For example, variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized. Similarly, changes in legal trends and interpretations, as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can affect ultimate costs. Our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables, and any changes could have a considerable effect on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities. Impairments of Long Lived Assets We monitor the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger events have occurred. These events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset. When a trigger event occurs, we perform an impairment calculation, comparing projected undiscounted cash flows, utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores, to the carrying value for those stores. If we identify impairment for long lived assets to be held and used, we compare the assets current carrying value to the assets fair value. Fair value is determined based on market values or discounted future cash flows. We record impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value. With respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal, we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions. We recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value, reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal. We recorded asset impairments in the normal course of business totaling $48 million in 2009, $26 million in 2008 and $24 million in 2007. Included in the 2009 amount are asset impairments recorded totaling $24 million for a southern California reporting unit. We record costs to reduce the carrying value of long lived assets in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as Operating, general and administrative expense. The factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows. Our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation, the economy and market competition. Application of alternative assumptions and definitions, such as reviewing long lived assets for impairment at a different level, could produce significantly different results. Goodwill Our goodwill totaled $1.2 billion as of January 30, 2010. We review goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year, and also upon the occurrence of triggering events. We perform reviews of each of our operating divisions and variable interest entities with goodwill balances. Fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings, or discounted projected future cash flows, and we compare fair value to the carrying value of a reporting unit for purposes of identifying potential impairment. We base projected future cash flows on managements knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future. If we identify potential for impairment, we measure the fair value of a division against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities, excluding goodwill, to estimate an implied fair value of the divisions goodwill. We recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of the carrying value of the divisions goodwill over the implied fair value. In the third quarter of 2009, our operating performance suffered due to persistent deflation and intense competition. Based on our revised forecast, during the third quarter of 2009, and the initial results of our 2010 annual budget process for the supermarket reporting units, management believed that there were circumstances evident to warrant impairment testing at these reporting units. We did not test for impairment our variable interest entities with recorded goodwill balances as no triggering event occurred. The Ralphs reporting unit in Southern California was the only reporting unit for which there was a potential impairment. The operating performance of the Ralphs reporting unit was significantly affected by economic conditions and responses to competitive actions in Southern California. As a result of this decline in current and future expected cash flows, along with comparable fair value information, management concluded that the carrying value of goodwill for the Ralphs reporting unit exceeded its implied fair value, resulting in an impairment charge. Subsequent to the impairment, no goodwill remains at the Ralphs reporting unit. Management used an equal weighting of discounted cash flows and a sales weighted EBITDA multiple to estimate fair value. The discounted cash flows assume long term sales growth rates comparable to historical performances and a discount rate of 11%. In addition, the EBITDA multiples observed in the marketplace declined since those used in the January 31, 2009 assessment. We performed our annual assessment in the fourth quarter for all supermarket and Variable Interest Entity (VIE) reporting units with goodwill balances. Based on current and future expected cash flows, we believe additional goodwill impairments are not reasonably possible. A 10% reduction in fair value of our reporting units would not indicate a potential for impairment of our remaining goodwill balance, except for one supermarket reporting unit and one VIE reporting unit with recorded goodwill of $19 million and $102 million, respectively. 16 For additional information relating to our results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during 2009, 2008 and 2007 see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The impairment review requires the extensive use of management judgment and financial estimates. Application of alternative estimates and assumptions, such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different level, could produce significantly different results. The cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several factors such as inflation, business valuations in the market, the economy and market competition. Store Closing Costs We provide for closed store liabilities on the basis of the present value of the estimated remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date, net of estimated subtenant income. We estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores. We usually pay closed store lease liabilities over the lease terms associated with the closed stores, which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to 20 years. Adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates. We make adjustments for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known. We review store closing liabilities quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs, or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose, is adjusted to earnings in the proper period. We estimate subtenant income, future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located, our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions. The ultimate cost of the disposition of the leases and the related assets is affected by current real estate markets, inflation rates and general economic conditions. We reduce owned stores held for disposal to their estimated net realizable value. We account for costs to reduce the carrying values of property, equipment and leasehold improvements in accordance with our policy on impairment of long lived assets. We classify inventory write downs in connection with store closings, if any, in Merchandise costs. We expense costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores as they are incurred. Post Retirement Benefit Plans (a) Company sponsored defined benefit Pension Plans We account for our defined benefit pension plans using the recognition and disclosure provisions of GAAP, which require the recognition of the funded status of retirement plans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We record, as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI), actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that have not yet been recognized. We adopted the measurement date provisions of GAAP effective February 3, 2008. The majority of our pension and postretirement plans previously used a December 31 measurement date. All plans are measured as of our fiscal year end. The non cash effect of the adoption of the measurement date provisions of GAAP decreased shareowners equity by approximately $5 million ($3 million after tax) and increased long term liabilities by approximately $5 million. There was no effect on our results of operations. The determination of our obligation and expense for Company sponsored pension plans and other post retirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts. Those assumptions are described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and include, among others, the discount rate, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, average life expectancy and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions, including the discount rate used and the expected return on plan assets, may materially affect our pension and other post retirement obligations and our future expense. Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements discusses the effect of a 1% change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other post retirement benefit costs and the related liability. 17 The objective of our discount rate assumptions was intended to reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. In making this determination, we take into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans. Our methodology for selecting the discount rates as of year end 2009 was to match the plans cash flows to that of a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zero coupon corporate bonds for each maturity. Benefit cash flows due in a particular year can theoretically be settled by investing them in the zero coupon bond that matures in the same year. The discount rates are the single rates that produce the same present value of cash flows. The selection of the 6.00% and 5.80% discount rates as of year end 2009 for pension and other benefits, respectively, represent the equivalent single rates constructed under a broad market AA yield curve. We utilized a discount rate of 7.00% for year end 2008 for both pension and other benefits. A 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the projected pension benefit obligation as of January 30, 2010, by approximately $317 million. To determine the expected return on pension plan assets, we consider current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted returns on various asset categories. For 2009 and 2008, we assumed a pension plan investment return rate of 8.5%. Our pension plans average return was 5.9% for the 10 calendar years ended December 31, 2009, net of all investment management fees and expenses. The value of all investments in our Company sponsored defined benefit pension plans during the calendar year ending December 31, 2009, net of investment management fees and expenses, increased 23.8%, primarily due to the strength of the market in 2009. We believe our 8.5% pension return assumption is appropriate. For the past 20 years, our average annual return has been 10.0%. The average annual return for the S&P 500 over the same period of time has been 9.3%. In addition, forward looking assumptions for investments made in a manner consistent with our target allocations indicate an 8.5% return assumption is reasonable. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the asset allocations of pension plan assets. Sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions used in the calculation of Krogers pension plan liabilities for the qualified plans is illustrated below (in millions). Percentage Point Change Projected Benefit Obligation Decrease/(Increase) Expense Decrease/(Increase) Discount Rate +/ 1.0 % $ 317/($383 ) $ 11/($29 ) Expected Return on Assets +/ 1.0 % $ 23/($23 ) We contributed $265 million in 2009, $20 million in 2008 and $52 million in 2007 to our Company sponsored defined benefit pension plans. Although we are not required to make cash contributions to Company sponsored defined benefit pension plans during 2010, we expect to contribute approximately $110 million to these plans in 2010. Additional contributions may be made if required under the Pension Protection Act to avoid any benefit restrictions. We expect any elective contributions made during 2010 will decrease our required contributions in future years. Among other things, investment performance of plan assets, the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations, and future changes in legislation, will determine the amounts of any additional contributions. We contributed and expensed $115 million in 2009, $92 million in 2008 and $90 million in 2007 to employee 401(k) retirement savings accounts. The 401(k) retirement savings account plan provides to eligible employees both matching contributions and automatic contributions from the Company based on participant contributions, plan compensation, and length of service. (b) Multi Employer Plans We also contribute to various multi employer pension plans based on obligations arising from most of our collective bargaining agreements. These plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers. The benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose. Trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions. The trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans. We recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded, in accordance with GAAP. We made contributions to these plans, and recognized expense, of $233 million in 2009, $219 million in 2008 and $207 million in 2007. 18 Based on the most recent information available to us, we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most or all of these multi employer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits. We have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets, (i.e., the amount of underfunding), as of December 31, 2009. Because Kroger is only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans, we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of Krogers contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing Krogers share of the underfunding. Nonetheless, the underfunding is not a direct obligation or liability of Kroger or of any employer. As of December 31, 2009, we estimate that Krogers share of the underfunding of multi employer plans to which Kroger contributes was $2.7 billion, pre tax, or $1.7 billion, after tax. This represents a decrease in the estimated amount of underfunding of $380 million, pre tax, or $238 million, after tax, as of December 31, 2009, compared to December 31, 2008. The decrease in the amount of underfunding is attributable to the strength of the market during the last year and benefit reductions. Our estimate is based on the most current information available to us including actuarial evaluations and other data (that include the estimates of others), and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable. Our estimate is imprecise and not necessarily reliable. We have made and disclosed this estimate not because this underfunding is a direct liability of Kroger. Rather, we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences. In 2009, our contributions to these plans increased approximately 6% over the prior year and have grown at a compound annual rate of approximately 6% since 2004. In 2010, we expect to contribute approximately $250 million to our multi employer pension plans, subject to collective bargaining and capital market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we expect meaningful increases in funding and in expense as a result of increases in multi employer pension plan contributions over the next five years, but we believe it is unlikely that contributions will double during that period, which is a change from our estimate at year end 2008. Finally, underfunding means that, in the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these funds, we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability. Any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated, in accordance with GAAP. The amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and could change based on contract negotiations, returns on the assets held in the multi employer plans and benefit payments. The amount could decline, and Krogers future expense would be favorably affected, if the values of the assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining, trustee action or favorable legislation. On the other hand, Krogers share of the underfunding could increase and Krogers future expense could be adversely affected if the asset values decline, if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining, trustee action or adverse legislation. Deferred Rent We recognize rent holidays, including the time period during which we have access to the property for construction of buildings or improvements, as well as construction allowances and escalating rent provisions on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. The deferred amount is included in Other Current Liabilities and Other Long Term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Uncertain Tax Positions Effective February 4, 2007, we adopted new standards for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. These standards prescribe a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. These standards also provide guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. Various taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions, including state and local taxes, we record allowances for probable exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which an allowance has been established, is audited and fully resolved. As of January 30, 2010, the most recent examination concluded by the Internal Revenue Service covered the years 2002 through 2004. The assessment of our tax position relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with its various filing positions. 19 Share Based Compensation Expense We account for stock options under the fair value recognition provisions of GAAP. Under this method, we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments granted after January 29, 2006, as well as all share based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of, January 29, 2006. We recognize share based compensation expense, net of an estimated forfeiture rate, over the requisite service period of the award. In addition, we record expense for restricted stock awards in an amount equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date of the award, over the period the award restrictions lapse. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (principally on a LIFO basis) or market. In total, approximately 97% in 2009 and 98% in 2008 of inventories were valued using the LIFO method. Cost for the balance of the inventories was determined using the FIFO method. Replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by $803 million at January 30, 2010, and by $754 million at January 31, 2009. We follow the Link Chain, Dollar Value LIFO method for purposes of calculating our LIFO charge or credit. We follow the item cost method of accounting to determine inventory cost before the LIFO adjustment for substantially all store inventories at our supermarket divisions. This method involves counting each item in inventory, assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs (net of vendor allowances and cash discounts) of each item and recording the cost of items sold. The item cost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory and purchasing levels when compared to the methodology followed under the retail method of accounting. We evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities. We record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date. Vendor Allowances We recognize all vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs when the related product is sold. In most cases, vendor allowances are applied to the related product cost by item, and therefore reduce the carrying value of inventory by item. When it is not practicable to allocate vendor allowances to the product by item, we recognize vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs based on inventory turns and as the product is sold. We recognized approximately $5.4 billion in 2009, $5.0 billion in 2008 and $5.1 billion in 2007 of vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs. All years presented now include amounts for certain vendor allowances related to directed store deliveries. We recognized approximately 94% of all vendor allowances in the item cost with the remainder being based on inventory turns. 20 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flow Information Net cash provided by operating activities We generated $2.9 billion of cash from operations in 2009 and 2008 compared to $2.6 billion in 2007. The cash provided by operating activities came from net earnings including noncontrolling interests adjusted primarily for non cash expenses of depreciation and amortization, goodwill impairment charge, and changes in our operating assets and liabilities. We realized an increase in cash of $6 million in 2009 and decreases in cash of $412 million in 2008 and $179 million in 2007 from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in the change in operating assets and liabilities in 2009, compared to 2008, is primarily due to an increase in the changes of income taxes receivable and payable, accounts payable and inventories, offset partially by decreases in the changes of deposits in transit and prepaid expenses. The decrease in the change in operating assets and liabilities in 2008, compared to 2007, is primarily due to a decrease in the change in income taxes receivable and payable. These amounts are also net of cash contributions to our Company sponsored defined benefit pension plans totaling $265 million in 2009, $20 million in 2008 and $51 million in 2007. The amount of cash paid for income taxes decreased in 2009, compared to 2008 and 2007, because we applied our 2008 overpayment of income taxes to current year taxes. The 2008 overpayment resulted primarily from accounting method changes related to asset capitalization. Net cash used by investing activities Cash used by investing activities was $2.3 billion in 2009, compared to $2.2 billion in 2008 and 2007. The amount of cash used by investing activities increased in 2009, compared to 2008, due primarily to higher capital spending, partially offset by decreased payments for acquisitions. Our use of cash for investing activities was consistent in 2008, compared to 2007. Capital expenditures, including changes in construction in progress payables and excluding acquisitions, were $2.3 billion in 2009, $2.2 billion in 2008 and $2.1 billion in 2007. Refer to the Capital Expenditures section for an overview of our supermarket storing activity during the last three years. Net cash used by financing activities Financing activities used $434 million of cash in 2009 compared to $769 million in 2008 and $310 million in 2007. The decrease in the amount of cash used for financing activities in 2009, compared to 2008, was primarily related to the decrease in the amount of treasury stock purchased and payments on long term debt and our credit facility, offset by decreased proceeds from the issuance of long term debt and capital stock. The increase in the amount of cash used in 2008, compared to 2007, was primarily a result of payments on long term debt and the bank revolver, offset by decreased stock repurchases. We repurchased $218 million of Kroger stock in 2009 compared to $637 million in 2008 and $1.4 billion in 2007. We paid dividends totaling $238 million in 2009, $227 million in 2008 and $202 million in 2007. Debt Management Total debt, including both the current and long term portions of capital leases and lease financing obligations, decreased $7 million to $8.1 billion as of year end 2009, compared to year end 2008. The decrease in 2009, compared to 2008, resulted from the issuance of $500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 3.90%, offset by payment at maturity of our $350 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 7.25%, decreased outstanding commercial paper and payments on our money market lines. Total debt decreased $59 million to $8.1 billion as of year end 2008, compared to year end 2007. The decrease in 2008, compared to 2007, resulted from the issuance of $400 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 5.00%, $375 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 6.90% and $600 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 7.50%, offset by decreased commercial paper, the payments on the bank revolver, the repayment of $200 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 6.375% and $750 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 7.45% that came due in 2008. Our total debt balances were also affected by our prefunding of employee benefit costs and by the mark to market adjustments necessary to record fair value interest rate hedges on our fixed rate debt. We had prefunded employee benefit costs of $300 million in each of the three years ended 2009, 2008 and 2007. The mark to market adjustments increased the carrying value of our debt by $57 million in 2009 and $45 million in 2008. 21 Factors Affecting Liquidity We can currently borrow on a daily basis approximately $1 billion under our A2/P2/F2 rated commercial paper (CP) program. At January 30, 2010, we did not have any CP borrowings outstanding. CP borrowings are backed by our credit facility, and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility. If our credit rating declines below its current level of BBB/ Baa2/BBB, the ability to borrow under our current CP program could be adversely affected for a period of time immediately following the reduction of our credit rating and lower the amount we are able to borrow on a daily basis under our CP program. This could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility, under which we believe we have sufficient capacity. However, in the event of a ratings decline, we do not anticipate that our borrowing capacity under our CP program would be any lower than $400 million on a daily basis. Although our ability to borrow under the credit facility is not affected by our credit rating, the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facility could be affected by a decrease in our credit rating or a decrease in our Applicable Percentage Ratio. Our credit facility also requires the maintenance of a Leverage Ratio and a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (our financial covenants). A failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facility. These financial covenants and ratios are described below: Our Applicable Percentage Ratio (the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Total Interest Expense, as defined in the credit facility) was 7.69 to 1 as of January 30, 2010. Our current borrowing rates are determined from the better of our Applicable Percentage Ratio or our credit ratings as defined by the credit facility. Our Leverage Ratio (the ratio of Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the credit facility) was 2.22 to 1 as of January 30, 2010. If this ratio exceeded 3.50 to 1, we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired. Our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA plus Consolidated Rental Expense to Consolidated Cash Interest Expense plus Consolidated Rental Expense, as defined in the credit facility) was 3.82 to 1 as of January 30, 2010. If this ratio fell below 1.70 to 1, we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired. Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in our credit facility, includes an adjustment for unusual gains and losses including our non cash asset impairment charge related to goodwill in 2009. Our credit agreement is more fully described in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We were in compliance with our financial covenants at year end 2009. 22 The tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments, based on year of maturity or settlement, as of January 30, 2010 (in millions of dollars): 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations (1) (2) Long term debt(3) $ 549 $ 513 $ 933 $ 1,514 $ 312 $ 3,755 $ 7,576 Interest on long term debt (4) 497 446 377 313 257 2,217 4,107 Capital lease obligations 54 59 49 47 43 221 473 Operating lease obligations 764 705 652 600 546 3,692 6,959 Low income housing obligations 5 2 2 9 Financed lease obligations 14 14 14 14 14 165 235 Self insurance liability (5) 182 115 75 48 29 36 485 Construction commitments 184 184 Purchase obligations 457 78 53 42 20 32 682 Total $ 2,706 $ 1,932 $ 2,155 $ 2,578 $ 1,221 $ 10,118 $ 20,710 Other Commercial Commitments Standby letters of credit $ 323 $ $ $ $ $ $ 323 Surety bonds 204 204 Guarantees 23 23 Total $ 550 $ $ $ $ $ $ 550 (1) The contractual obligations table excludes funding of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, which totaled approximately $289 million in 2009. This table also excludes contributions under various multi employer pension plans, which totaled $233 million in 2009. (2) We adopted new standards for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes on February 4, 2007. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding this adoption. The liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing of future tax settlements cannot be determined. (3) We did not have any borrowings under our credit facility as of January 30, 2010. (4) Amounts include contractual interest payments using the interest rate as of January 30, 2010, and stated fixed and swapped interest rates, if applicable, for all other debt instruments. (5) The amounts included in the contractual obligations table for self insurance liability have been stated on a present value basis. Our construction commitments include funds owed to third parties for projects currently under construction. These amounts are reflected in other current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our purchase obligations include commitments to be utilized in the normal course of business, such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our manufacturing plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and manufacturing facilities. Our obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties. Any upfront vendor allowances or incentives associated with outstanding purchase commitments are recorded as either current or long term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of January 30, 2010, we maintained a $2.5 billion, five year revolving credit facility that, unless extended, terminates in 2011. Outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and commercial paper borrowings, and some outstanding letters of credit, reduce funds available under the credit agreement. In addition to the credit agreement, we maintained three uncommitted money market lines totaling $100 million in the aggregate. The money market lines allow us to borrow from banks at mutually agreed upon rates, usually at rates below the rates offered under the credit agreement. As of January 30, 2010, we had no borrowings under our credit agreement, money market lines or outstanding commercial paper. The outstanding letters of credit that reduce funds available under our credit agreement totaled $313 million as of January 30, 2010. In addition to the available credit mentioned above, as of January 30, 2010, we had authorized for issuance $900 million of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC and effective on December 20, 2007. 23 We also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our self insured workers compensation claims. These bonds are required by most states in which we are self insured for workers compensation and are placed with third party insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to meet our claim payment obligations up to our self insured retention levels. These bonds do not represent liabilities of Kroger, as we already have reserves on our books for the claims costs. Market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and, in some instances, availability of these bonds may become more limited, which could affect our costs of, or access to, such bonds. Although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly affect our ability to access these surety bonds, if this does become an issue, we would issue letters of credit, in states where allowed, against our credit facility to meet the state bonding requirements. This could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facility. Most of our outstanding public debt is jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed by The Kroger Co. and some of our subsidiaries. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of those arrangements. In addition, we have guaranteed half of the indebtedness of two real estate entities in which we have a 50% ownership interest. Our share of the responsibility for this indebtedness, should the entities be unable to meet their obligations, totals approximately $7 million. Based on the covenants underlying this indebtedness as of January 30, 2010, it is unlikely that we will be responsible for repayment of these obligations. We have also agreed to guarantee, up to $25 million, the indebtedness of an entity in which we have a 50% ownership interest. Our share of the responsibility, as of January 30, 2010, should the entity be unable to meet its obligations, totals approximately $25 million and is collateralized by approximately $9 million of inventory located in our stores. We consolidate this entity because we are the primary beneficiary, and therefore the entire $25 million is a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions. We could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations. Due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties, and various other remedies available to us, we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote. We have agreed to indemnify certain third party logistics operators for certain expenses, including pension trust fund contribution obligations and withdrawal liabilities. In addition to the above, we enter into various indemnification agreements and take on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business. Such arrangements include indemnities against third party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to Kroger; indemnities related to the sale of our securities; indemnities of directors, officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work; and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans. While Krogers aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability, we are not aware of any current matter that could result in a material liability. RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2008, the FASB amended its existing standards to provide additional guidance on employers disclosures about the plan assets of defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The new standards require disclosures about how investment allocation decisions are made, the fair value of each major category of plan assets, valuation techniques used to develop fair value measurements of plan assets, the effect of measurements on changes in plan assets when using significant unobservable inputs and significant concentrations of risk in the plan assets. The new standards become effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009. We adopted the amended standards effective January 30, 2010. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the new required disclosures. Effective May 24, 2009, we adopted new standards for subsequent events. The purpose of the new standards is to establish general standards of accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the new required disclosures. Effective May 24, 2009, we adopted new standards that effect the accounting and disclosures related to certain financial instruments including: (a) providing additional guidance for estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased; (b) identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly; (c) amending the other than temporary impairment guidance for debt securities to make the guidance more operational and to improve the presentation and disclosure of other than temporary impairments on debt and equity securities in the financial statements; and (d) requiring disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments on an interim basis in addition to the annual disclosure requirements. The new disclosures are included in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The adoption of these new standards did not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 24 Effective February 1, 2009, we adopted the new standards that require enhanced disclosures on an entitys derivative and hedging activities. The new disclosures are included in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective February 1, 2009, we adopted the new standards that clarify that share based payment awards that entitle their holders to receive nonforfeitable dividends before vesting should be considered participating securities and included in the computation of EPS pursuant to the two class method. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of its adoption. Effective February 1, 2009, we adopted new standards related to business combinations. The new standards expand the definitions of a business and the fair value measurement and reporting in a business combination. All business combinations completed after February 1, 2009, will be accounted for under the new standards. Effective February 1, 2009, we adopted new standards that deferred the fair value disclosures for most non financial assets and non financial liabilities to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the adoption of the new standards. In December 2007, the FASB amended its existing standards for a parents noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and the accounting for future ownership changes with respect to the subsidiary. The new standard defines a noncontrolling interest, previously called a minority interest, as the portion of equity in a subsidiary that is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. The new standard requires, among other things, that a noncontrolling interest be clearly identified, labeled and presented in the consolidated balance sheet as equity, but separate from the parents equity; that the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income; and that if a subsidiary is deconsolidated, the parent measure at fair value any noncontrolling equity investment that the parent retains in the former subsidiary and recognize a gain or loss in net income based on the fair value of the non controlling equity investment. We adopted the new standard effective February 1, 2009, and applied it retrospectively. As a result, we reclassified noncontrolling interests in amounts of $95 from the mezzanine section to equity in the January 31, 2009 Consolidated Balance Sheet. Certain reclassifications to the Consolidated Statements of Operations have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the presentation of the current period under the new standard. Recorded amounts for prior periods previously presented as Net Earnings, which are now presented as Net Earnings Attributable to The Kroger Co., have not changed as a result of the adoption of the new standard. Effective January 31, 2009, we adopted the amended standards related to disclosures about interests in VIEs. These amended standards require additional disclosures about an entitys involvement with VIEs and transfers of financial assets. The adoption of these new amended standards did not change any disclosures in our Consolidated Financial Statements due to our VIEs being immaterial. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2009, the FASB amended its existing standards to change how a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting (or similar rights) should be consolidated. The new standards will become effective for our fiscal year beginning January 31, 2010. While we are still finalizing the evaluation of the impact of these amended standards on our Consolidated Financial Statements, we believe these new standards will not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2010, the FASB issued guidance that amends and clarifies existing guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures. This guidance requires new disclosures for (1) transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 and reasons for such transfers; and (2) the separate presentation of purchases, sales, issuances and settlement in the Level 3 reconciliation. It also clarifies guidance around disaggregation and disclosures of inputs and valuation techniques for Level 2 and Level 3 fair value measurements. This guidance is effective for our first quarter of 2010, except for the new disclosures in the Level 3 reconciliation. The Level 3 disclosures are effective for our first quarter of 2011. We do not expect that this guidance will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 25 OUTLOOK This discussion and analysis contains certain forward looking statements about Krogers future performance. These statements are based on managements assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available. Such statements relate to, among other things: projected changes in net earnings attributable to The Kroger Co.; identical supermarket sales growth; expected product cost; expected pension plan contributions; our ability to generate operating cash flow; projected capital expenditures; square footage growth; opportunities to reduce costs; cash flow requirements; and our operating plan for the future; and are indicated by words such as comfortable, committed, will, expect, goal, should, intend, target, believe, anticipate, plan, and similar words or phrases. These forward looking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations, projections, beliefs, intentions or strategies are forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. While we believe that the statements are accurate, uncertainties about the general economy, our labor relations, our ability to execute our plans on a timely basis and other uncertainties described below could cause actual results to differ materially. We expect net earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.60 $1.80 for 2010. We expect identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel sales, of 2.0% 3.0% in 2010. For 2010, we will continue to focus on driving sales growth and balancing investments in gross margin and improved customer service to provide a better shopping experience for our customers. We expect to finance these investments primarily with operating cost reductions. We expect non fuel operating margins to have a slight reduction to a slight improvement in rate in 2010, from 2009, excluding the non cash impairment charges recorded. For 2010, we expect fuel margins, which can be highly volatile, to be approximately $0.11 per gallon, and we expect continued strong growth in fuel gallons sold. For 2010, we expect our annualized LIFO charge to be approximately $50 million. This forecast is based on cost changes for products in our inventory. We plan to use cash flow primarily for capital investments, to maintain our current debt coverage ratios, and to pay cash dividends. As market conditions change, we plan to re evaluate the above uses of cash flow and our stock repurchase activity. We expect to obtain sales growth from new square footage, as well as from increased productivity from existing locations. Capital expenditures reflect our strategy of growth through expansion, as well as focusing on productivity increases from our existing store base through remodels. In addition, we will continue our emphasis on self development and ownership of real estate, logistics and technology improvements. The continued capital spending in technology is focused on improving store operations, logistics, manufacturing procurement, category management, merchandising and buying practices, and should reduce merchandising costs. We intend to continue using cash flow from operations to finance capital expenditure requirements. We expect capital investments for 2010 to be in the range of $1.9 $2.1 billion, excluding acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities. We expect total food store square footage to grow approximately1.0% 1.5% before acquisitions and operational closings. We expect to reduce our internal capital plans by approximately $1 billion in total over the next three fiscal years. Our original internal capital plans projected year over year continued capital expenditure growth. We now expect capital expenditures to average under $2 billion a year over the next three years. Based on current operating trends, we believe that cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity, including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility, will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, interest payments and scheduled principal payments for the foreseeable future. We also believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to respond effectively to competitive conditions. We believe we have adequate sources of cash, if needed, under our credit agreement. 26 We expect that our OG&A results will be affected by increased costs, such as higher employee benefit costs and credit card fees, offset by improved productivity from process changes and leverage gained through sales increases. We expect that our effective tax rate for 2010 will be approximately 37.0%. We expect rent expense, as a percentage of total sales and excluding closed store activity, will decrease due to the emphasis our current strategy places on ownership of real estate. We believe that in 2010 there will be opportunities to reduce our operating costs in such areas as administration, productivity improvements, shrink, warehousing and transportation. These savings will be invested in our core business to drive profitable sales growth and offer improved value and shopping experiences for our customers. Although we are not required to make cash contributions to Company sponsored defined benefit pension plans during 2010, we expect to contribute approximately $110 million to these plans in 2010. We expect any elective contributions made during 2010 will decrease our required contributions in future years. Among other things, investment performance of plan assets, the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations, and future changes in legislation, will determine the amounts of any additional contributions. We expect 2010 expense for Company sponsored defined benefit pension plans to be approximately $70 million. In addition, we expect our cash contributions and expense to the 401(k) Retirement Savings Account Plan from automatic and matching contributions to participants to increase slightly in 2010, compared to 2009. We expect to contribute approximately $250 million to multi employer pension plans in 2010, subject to collective bargaining and capital market conditions. In addition, we expect meaningful increases in expense as a result of increases in multi employer pension plan contributions over the next five years, but we believe it unlikely that contributions will double during that period, which is a change from our estimate at year end 2008. We expect bad debt expense from the credit extended to our customers through our Company branded credit card in 2010 to be approximately $22 million. We believe no additional goodwill impairments will be reasonably possible in 2010. We have various labor agreements that will be negotiated in 2010, covering store employees in Albuquerque, Cincinnati, Dallas, Detroit, Ft. Wayne, Houston, Little Rock, Portland, Seattle and Toledo. We will also negotiate agreements with the Teamsters for employees in California and Portland. Upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements, work stoppages by the affected workers could occur if we are unable to negotiate new contracts with labor unions. A prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our results. In all of these contracts, rising health care and pension costs will continue to be an important issue in negotiations. Various uncertainties and other factors could cause us to fail to achieve our goals. These include: The extent to which our sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet our requirements may be affected by the state of the financial markets and the effect that such condition has on our ability to issue commercial paper at acceptable rates. Our ability to borrow under our committed lines of credit, including our bank credit facilities, could be impaired if one or more of our lenders under those lines is unwilling or unable to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us. If market conditions change, it could affect our cash flow. Our ability to achieve sales and earnings goals may be affected by: labor disputes; industry consolidation; pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors, including non traditional competitors; our response to these actions; the state of the economy, including interest rates and the inflationary and deflationary trends in certain commodities; manufacturing commodity costs; diesel fuel costs related to our logistics operations; trends in consumer spending; the extent to which our customers exercise caution in their purchasing in response to economic conditions; stock repurchases; and the success of our future growth plans. The extent to which the adjustments we are making to our strategy create value for our shareholders will depend primarily on the reaction of our customers and our competitors to these adjustments, as well as operating conditions, including persistent deflation, increased competitive activity, and cautious spending behavior of our customers. 27 Our product cost inflation could vary from our estimate due to general economic conditions, weather, availability of raw materials and ingredients in the products that we sell and their packaging, and other factors beyond our control. Our ability to use free cash flow to continue to maintain our debt coverage and to reward our shareholders could be affected by unanticipated increases in net total debt, our inability to generate free cash flow at the levels anticipated, and our failure to generate expected earnings. The timing of our recognition of LIFO expense will be affected primarily by changes in product costs during the year. If actual results differ significantly from anticipated future results for certain reporting units including variable interest entities, an impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value would have to be recognized. In addition to the factors identified above, our identical store sales growth could be affected by increases in Kroger private label sales, the effect of our sister stores (new stores opened in close proximity to an existing store) and reductions in retail pricing. Our operating margins, without fuel, could decline more than expected if we are unable to pass on any cost increases, fail to deliver the cost savings contemplated or if changes in the cost of our inventory and the timing of those changes differ from our expectations. We could fail to realize our expected operating margin per gallon of fuel and fuel gallons sold based upon changes in the price of fuel or a change in our operating costs. We have estimated our exposure to the claims and litigation arising in the normal course of business, as well as to the material litigation facing Kroger, and believe we have made provisions where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable. Unexpected outcomes in these matters, however, could result in an adverse effect on our earnings. Consolidation in the food industry is likely to continue and the effects on our business, either favorable or unfavorable, cannot be foreseen. Rent expense, which includes subtenant rental income, could be adversely affected by the state of the economy, increased store closure activity and future consolidation. Depreciation expense, which includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital leases, is computed principally using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of individual assets, or the remaining terms of leases. Use of the straight line method of depreciation creates a risk that future asset write offs or potential impairment charges related to store closings would be larger than if an accelerated method of depreciation were followed. Our effective tax rate may differ from the expected rate due to changes in laws, the status of pending items with various taxing authorities and the deductibility of certain expenses. The actual amount of automatic and matching cash contributions to our 401(k) Retirement Savings Account Plan will depend on the number of participants, savings rate, plan compensation, and length of service of participants. Our contributions and recorded expense related to multi employer pension funds could increase more than anticipated. Should asset values in these funds deteriorate, if employers withdraw from these funds without providing for their share of the liability, or should our estimates prove to be understated, our contributions could increase more rapidly than we have anticipated. If weakness in the financial markets continues or worsens, our contributions to Company sponsored defined benefit pension plans could increase more than anticipated. Changes in laws or regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements and environmental laws may have a material effect on our financial statements. 28 Changes in the general business and economic conditions in our operating regions may affect the shopping habits of our customers, which could affect sales and earnings. Changes in the general business and economic conditions in our operating regions, including the rate of inflation, population growth, and employment and job growth in the markets in which we operate, may affect our ability to hire and train qualified employees to operate our stores. This would negatively affect earnings and sales growth. Changes in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial indicators. For example, we continue to add supermarket fuel centers to our store base. Since gasoline generates low profit margins, we expect to see our FIFO gross profit margins decline as gasoline sales increase. Although this negatively affects our FIFO gross margin, gasoline sales provide a positive effect on OG&A expense as a percentage of sales. Our capital expenditures, expected square footage growth, and number of store projects completed over the next three fiscal years could differ from our estimate if we are unsuccessful in acquiring suitable sites for new stores, if development costs vary from those budgeted, if our logistics and technology projects are not completed in the time frame expected or on budget or if current operating conditions fail to improve or worsen. Interest expense could be adversely affected by the interest rate environment, changes in the Companys credit ratings, fluctuations in the amount of outstanding debt, decisions to incur prepayment penalties on the early redemption of debt and any factor that adversely affects our operations and results in an increase in debt. Impairment losses, including goodwill, could be affected by changes in our assumptions of future cash flows, market values or business valuations in the market. Our cash flow projections include several years of projected cash flows which would be affected by changes in the economic environment, real estate market values, competitive activity, inflation and customer behavior. Our estimated expense and obligation for Company sponsored pension plans and other post retirement benefits could be affected by changes in the assumptions used in calculating those amounts. These assumptions include, among others, the discount rate, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, average life expectancy and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs. Adverse weather conditions could increase the cost our suppliers charge for their products, or may decrease the customer demand for certain products. Increases in demand for certain commodities could also increase the cost our suppliers charge for their products. Additionally, increases in the cost of inputs, such as utility costs or raw material costs, could negatively affect financial ratios and earnings. Although we presently operate only in the United States, civil unrest in foreign countries in which our suppliers do business may affect the prices we are charged for imported goods. If we are unable to pass on these increases to our customers, our FIFO gross margin and net earnings would suffer. Earnings and sales also may be affected by adverse weather conditions, particularly to the extent that hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, and other conditions disrupt our operations or those of our suppliers; create shortages in the availability or increases in the cost of products that we sell in our stores or materials and ingredients we use in our manufacturing facilities; or raise the cost of supplying energy to our various operations, including the cost of transportation. Other factors and assumptions not identified above could also cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking information. Accordingly, actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in, contemplated or implied by forward looking statements made by us or our representatives. 29 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Financial Risk Management We use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. As a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure. Because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure, fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure. The interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets. We manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of variable and fixed rate debt, and interest rate swaps. Our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. To do this, we use the following guidelines: (i) use average daily outstanding borrowings to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure, (ii) limit the average annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of $2.5 billion or less, (iii) include no leveraged products, and (iv) hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current mark to market status. As of January 30, 2010, we maintained 18 interest rate swap agreements, with notional amounts totaling $1.6 billion, to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates. These agreements mature at varying times between April 2012 and April 2013, and coincide with our scheduled debt maturities. The differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense. These interest rate swap agreements are being accounted for as fair value hedges. As of January 30, 2010, other long term assets totaling $26 million were recorded to reflect the fair value of these agreements, offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying debt. We have unamortized proceeds from twelve interest rate swaps once classified as fair value hedges totaling approximately $31 million. The unamortized proceeds are recorded as adjustments to the carrying values of the underlying debt and are being amortized over the remaining term of the debt. In addition to the interest rate swaps noted above, in 2005 we entered into three forward starting interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount totaling $750 million. A forward starting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges future benchmark interest rates on debt for an established period of time. We entered into the forward starting interest rate swaps in order to lock into fixed interest rates on forecasted issuances of debt in 2007 and 2008. In 2007, we terminated two of these forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $500 million. In 2008, we terminated the remaining forward interest rate swap with a notional amount of $250 million. As of January 30, 2010, the unamortized payments and proceeds of $11 million ($7 million net of tax) on these terminated forward starting interest rate swaps have been recorded net of tax in other comprehensive income and will be amortized to earnings as the payments of interest to which the hedge relates are made. Annually, we review with the Financial Policy Committee of our Board of Directors compliance with the guidelines described above. The guidelines may change as our business needs dictate. The tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives and underlying debt portfolio as of January 30, 2010. The amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of long term debt, excluding capital leases, and the average outstanding notional amounts of interest rate derivatives as of January 30, 2010. Interest rates reflect the weighted average rate for the outstanding instruments. The variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on U.S. dollar LIBOR using the forward yield curve as of January 30, 2010. The Fair Value column includes the fair value of our debt instruments and interest rate derivatives as of January 30, 2010. Refer to Notes 5, 6 and 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 30 Expected Year of Maturity 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total Fair Value (In millions) Debt Fixed rate $ (535 ) $ (490 ) $ (849 ) $ (1,510 ) $ (307 ) $ (3,736 ) $ (7,427 ) $ (8,134 ) Average interest rate 6.51 % 6.38 % 6.34 % 6.34 % 6.42 % 6.53 % Variable rate $ (14 ) $ (23 ) $ (84 ) $ (4 ) $ (5 ) $ (19 ) $ (149 ) $ (149 ) Average interest rate 2.58 % 3.05 % 4.06 % 5.83 % 6.57 % 6.95 % Average Notional Amounts Outstanding January 30, 2010 January 30, 2010 Fair 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total Value (In millions) Interest Rate Derivatives Fixed to variable $ 1,625 $ 1,625 $ 1,066 $ 78 $ $ $ 1,625 $ 26 Average pay rate 3.80 % 4.53 % 5.46 % 5.80 % Average receive rate 5.87 % 5.87 % 5.51 % 5.00 % Commodity Price Protection We enter into purchase commitments for various resources, including raw materials utilized in our manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in our stores, warehouses, manufacturing facilities and administrative offices. We enter into commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of normal business. Those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in the normal course of business qualify as normal purchases. 31
