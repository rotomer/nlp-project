ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OUR BUSINESS The Kroger Co. was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902. It is one of the nations largest retailers, as measured by revenue, operating 2,460 supermarket and multi department stores under two dozen banners including Kroger, City Market, Dillons, Jay C, Food 4 Less, Fred Meyer, Frys, King Soopers, QFC, Ralphs and Smiths. Of these stores, 1,014 have fuel centers. We also operate 784 convenience stores and 361 fine jewelry stores. Kroger operates 40 manufacturing plants, primarily bakeries and dairies, which supply approximately 40% of the corporate brand units sold in our retail outlets. Our revenues are earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores. We earn income predominately by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of the costs we incur to make these products available to our customers. Such costs include procurement and distribution costs, facility occupancy and operational costs, and overhead expenses. Our operations are reported as a single reportable segment: the retail sale of merchandise to individual customers. OUR 2010 PERFORMANCE Due to our consistent approach to managing our business and following our Customer 1st strategy, which continues to connect with a broad range of shoppers, we were able to report solid results in 2010. Our results reflect the balance we seek to achieve across our business including positive identical sales growth, increased tonnage and loyal household count, good cost control, as well as growth in earnings and earnings per diluted share. Our 2010 earnings were $1.74 per diluted share or $1.76 per diluted share, excluding the non cash goodwill impairment charge totaling $18 million, pre tax ($12 million, after tax), related to a small number of stores. Our identical supermarket sales increased by 2.8%, excluding fuel. We have achieved 29 consecutive quarters of positive identical sales growth, excluding fuel. As we continue to outpace many of our competitors on identical sales growth, we continue to gain market share. We focus on identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, because our business model emphasizes this primary component and those sales generate earnings and free cash flow that reward our shareholders. Market share is an important part of our long term strategy as it best reflects how our products and services resonate with customers. Market share growth allows us to spread the fixed costs in our business over a wider revenue base. Our fundamental operating philosophy is to maintain and increase market share by offering customers good prices and superior products and service. Based on Nielsen Homescan Data, our estimated market share increased in total by approximately 80 basis points in 2010 across the 19 marketing areas outlined by the Nielsen report. This information also indicates that our market share increased in 13 of the marketing areas, declined slightly in four, and remained unchanged in two. Our overall market share grew by approximately 75 basis points in 2010 in 17 of the 19 marketing areas where Wal Mart supercenters are a primary competitor. Nielsen Homescan Data is generated by customers who self report their grocery purchases to Nielsen, regardless of retail channel or grocery outlet. This data illustrates that not only are we growing bigger among traditional grocers, we are also gaining ground in the larger retail market for grocery and consumable items, which includes many non traditional competitors. These market share results are consistent with our long term strategy. 11 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion summarizes our operating results for 2010 compared to 2009 and for 2009 compared to 2008. Comparability is affected by income and expense items that fluctuated significantly between and among the periods. Net Earnings Net earnings totaled $1.1 billion in 2010, $70 million in 2009 and $1.2 billion in 2008. The net earnings for 2010 include a non cash goodwill impairment charge totaling $12 million, after tax, related to a small number of stores. The net earnings for 2009 include non cash asset impairment charges totaling $1.05 billion, after tax, related to a division in southern California (the non cash impairment charges). The 2009 impairment primarily resulted from the write off of the Ralphs division goodwill balance. Excluding these impairments charges for 2010 and 2009, adjusted net earnings for both 2010 and 2009 would have been $1.1 billion. Adjusted net earnings for 2010 improved due to lower interest expense, favorable resolutions for certain tax issues and higher retail fuel margins, partially offset by decreased non fuel operating profit and a LIFO charge of $57 million pre tax, compared to a LIFO charge of $49 million pre tax in 2009. The decrease in adjusted net earnings for 2009, compared to 2008 net earnings, resulted from lower retail fuel margins and decreased operating profit, partially offset by a LIFO charge of $49 million pre tax, compared to a LIFO charge of $196 million pre tax in 2008. 2008 net earnings also included after tax costs of $16 million from disruption and damage caused by Hurricane Ike. Management believes adjusted net earnings (and adjusted net earnings per diluted share) are useful metrics to investors and analysts because impairment charges are non recurring, non cash charges that are not directly related to our day to day business. 2010 net earnings per diluted share totaled $1.74, and adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2010 totaled $1.76, which excludes the $0.02 per diluted share for the non cash goodwill impairment charge. Net earnings per diluted share was $0.11 in 2009, and adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2009 was $1.71, which excludes the $1.60 per diluted share for the non cash asset impairment charges. Net earnings per diluted share totaled $1.89 in 2008, and adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2008 was $1.91, which excludes the $0.02 per diluted share for costs for damage and disruption caused by Hurricane Ike. Adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2010 increased due to increased retail fuel margins and the repurchase of Kroger stock, partially offset by reduced non fuel net earnings. The decline in adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2009 resulted from lower retail fuel margins and decreased operating profit, partially offset by lower LIFO charges and after tax costs of $16 million from disruption and damage caused by Hurricane Ike in 2008. Sales Total Sales (in millions) 2010 Percentage Increase 2009 Percentage Increase 2008 Total supermarket sales without fuel $ 67,882 3.4 % $ 65,649 2.9 % $ 63,795 Total supermarket fuel sales 9,111 36.6 % 6,671 (10.6 )% 7,464 Total supermarket sales $ 76,993 6.5 % $ 72,320 1.5 % $ 71,259 Other sales(1) 5,196 17.7 % 4,413 (9.7 )% 4,889 Total sales $ 82,189 7.1 % $ 76,733 0.8 % $ 76,148 (1) Other sales primarily relate to sales at convenience stores, including fuel; jewelry stores; manufacturing plants to outside customers; variable interest entities; and an in store health clinic. The increase in total sales for 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily the result of our identical supermarket sales increase, excluding fuel, of 2.8% and an increase in supermarket fuel sales of 36.6%. Total supermarket fuel sales increased over the same period due to a 16.8% increase in average retail fuel prices and a 17.2% increase in fuel gallons sold. The increase in the average supermarket retail fuel price was caused by an increase in the product cost of fuel. The increase in total supermarket sales without fuel for 2010 over 2009 was primarily the result of increases in identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, of 2.8% as well as an increase in supermarket square footage of 0.5%. Identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, increased primarily due to inflation, increased transaction count and an increase in the average sale per shopping trip. 12 The slight increase in total sales for 2009 compared to 2008 was attributable to our 2.1% increase in identical sales offset by our year over year decline in supermarket fuel sales of approximately 10.6%. Total supermarket fuel sales declined over the same period due to a decline in retail fuel prices of approximately 23.6%, offset partially by a 17.2% increase in gallons sold. Retail fuel prices decreased by approximately 23.6% year over year in 2009 compared to 2008 due to deflation in the product cost of fuel. The increase in total supermarket sales without fuel for 2009 over 2008 was primarily the result of increases in identical supermarket sales of 2.1% as well as an increase in supermarket square footage of 0.8%. Identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, increased due to increased transaction count offset partially by a lower average sale per shopping trip. We define a supermarket as identical when it has been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters. Fuel center discounts received at our fuel centers and earned based on in store purchases are included in all of the supermarket identical sales results calculations illustrated below. Differences between total supermarket sales and identical supermarket sales primarily relate to changes in supermarket square footage. Identical supermarket sales include all sales at identical Fred Meyer multi department stores. We calculate annualized identical supermarket sales by adding together four quarters of identical supermarket sales. Our identical supermarket sales results are summarized in the table below, based on the 52 week period of 2010, compared to the 52 week period of the previous year. The identical store count in the table below represents the total number of identical supermarkets as of January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010. Identical Supermarket Sales (dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Including supermarket fuel centers $ 74,144 $ 70,154 Excluding supermarket fuel centers $ 65,427 $ 63,637 Including supermarket fuel centers 5.7 % 0.6 % Excluding supermarket fuel centers 2.8 % 2.1 % Identical 4th Quarter store count 2,342 2,325 We define a supermarket as comparable when it has been in operation for five full quarters, including expansions and relocations. As is the case for identical supermarket sales, fuel center discounts received at our fuel centers and earned based on in store purchases are included in all of the supermarket comparable sales results calculations illustrated below. Comparable supermarket sales include all sales at comparable Fred Meyer multi department stores. We calculate annualized comparable supermarket sales by adding together four quarters of comparable sales. Our annualized comparable supermarket sales results are summarized in the table below, based on the 52 week period of 2010, compared to the same 52 week period of the previous year. The comparable store count in the table below represents the total number of comparable supermarkets as of January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010. Comparable Supermarket Sales (dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Including supermarket fuel centers $ 76,113 $ 71,816 Excluding supermarket fuel centers $ 67,156 $ 65,167 Including supermarket fuel centers 6.0 % 0.9 % Excluding supermarket fuel centers 3.1 % 2.5 % Comparable 4th Quarter store count 2,408 2,386 FIFO Gross Margin We calculate First In, First Out (FIFO) Gross Margin as sales minus merchandise costs, including advertising, warehousing and transportation, but excluding the Last In, First Out (LIFO) charge. Merchandise costs exclude depreciation and rent expense. FIFO gross margin is an important measure used by management to evaluate merchandising and operational effectiveness. Our FIFO gross margin rates, as a percentage of sales, were 22.29% in 2010, 23.23% in 2009 and 23.38% in 2008. Our retail fuel sales reduce our FIFO gross margin rate due to the very low FIFO gross margin on retail fuel sales as compared to non fuel sales. Excluding the effect of retail fuel operations, our FIFO gross margin rates decreased 33 basis points in 2010 and 58 basis points in 2009. FIFO gross margin in 2010, compared to 2009, decreased primarily from continued investments in lower prices for our customers and higher transportation expenses, as a percentage of sales. In addition, FIFO gross margin in 2009, compared to 2008, decreased due to heightened competitive activity and deflation, partially offset by improvements in shrink, advertising, and warehousing and transportation expenses, as a percentage of sales. 13 LIFO Charge The LIFO charge was $57 million in 2010, $49 million in 2009 and $196 million in 2008. A slight increase in annualized product cost inflation caused the increase in the LIFO charge in 2010, compared to 2009. In 2010, our LIFO charge primarily resulted from annualized product cost inflation related to meat, pharmacy, and Company manufactured products, partially offset by deflation in grocery products. The LIFO charge in 2009, compared to 2008, decreased primarily due to a decrease in annualized product cost inflation for those categories of inventory on the LIFO method of valuation for 2009 compared to 2008. The last three quarters of 2009 experienced product cost deflation, excluding fuel. In 2009, our LIFO charge primarily resulted from annualized product cost inflation related to tobacco and pharmacy products. Operating, General and Administrative Expenses Operating, general and administrative (OG&A) expenses consist primarily of employee related costs such as wages, health care benefit and retirement plan costs, utilities and credit card fees. Rent expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and interest expense are not included in OG&A. OG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 16.80% in 2010, 17.46% in 2009 and 17.14% in 2008. The growth in our retail fuel sales reduces our OG&A rate due to the very low OG&A rate on retail fuel sales as compared to non fuel sales. OG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales excluding fuel, decreased 14 basis points in 2010, compared to 2009. The 2010 decrease, compared to 2009, resulted primarily from increased supermarket identical sales growth, strong cost controls at the store level and reduced utility costs. These improvements were partially offset by increases in pension and health care expenses and credit card fees. OG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales excluding fuel, decreased 3 basis points in 2009, compared to 2008. The 2009 decrease, compared to 2008, resulted primarily from increased supermarket identical sales growth, a reduction in bag expense, lower incentive compensation, and reduced utility costs. These improvements were partially offset by increases in credit card fees, health care costs, and wages. Rent Expense Rent expense was $651 million in 2010, as compared to $648 million in 2009 and $659 million in 2008. Rent expense, as a percentage of sales, was 0.79% in 2010, as compared to 0.84% in 2009 and 0.87% in 2008. The continual decrease in rent expense, as a percentage of sales, reflects our continued emphasis on owning rather than leasing, whenever possible, and the benefit of increased supermarket sales. Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense was $1.6 billion in 2010, $1.5 billion in 2009 and $1.4 billion in 2008. The increase in depreciation expense from 2010, compared to 2009, was the result of additional depreciation on capital expenditures, including prior acquisitions and the prior purchase of leased facilities, totaling $1.9 billion in 2010. The increase in depreciation expense from 2009, compared to 2008, was the result of additional depreciation on capital expenditures, including prior acquisitions and the prior purchase of leased facilities, totaling $2.4 billion in 2009. Depreciation and amortization expense, as a percentage of sales, was 1.95% in 2010, 1.99% in 2009 and 1.89% in 2008. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in 2010, compared to 2009, as a percentage of sales, is primarily the result of increasing sales. The increase in our depreciation and amortization expense in 2009, compared to 2008, as a percentage of sales, is primarily due to increased depreciation expense, and a slower growth rate in sales due to heightened competitive activity, deflation and year over year decline in retail fuel prices. Interest Expense Net interest expense totaled $448 million in 2010, $502 million in 2009 and $485 million in 2008. The decrease in interest expense in 2010, compared to 2009, resulted primarily from a lower weighted average interest rate, an average lower debt balance for the year and an increase in our benefit from interest rate swaps. The increase in interest expense in 2009, compared to 2008, resulted primarily from a higher weighted average interest rate and a reduction in interest income, offset partially by our benefit from interest rate swaps. 14 Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 34.7% in 2010, 90.4% in 2009 and 36.5% in 2008. The 2010 effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the favorable resolution of certain tax issues, partially offset by the effect of state income taxes. The 2009 effective income tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily because the goodwill impairment charge incurred in that year was mostly non deductible for tax purposes. Excluding the non cash impairment charges, our effective rate in 2009 would have been 35.8%. In addition, the effective tax rate for 2009 differed from the expected federal statutory rate due to the resolution of certain tax issues and the effect of state income taxes. The 2008 effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state income taxes. COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM We maintain stock repurchase programs that comply with Securities Exchange Act Rule 10b5 1 and allow for the orderly repurchase of our common stock, from time to time. We made open market purchases of Kroger stock totaling $505 million in 2010, $156 million in 2009 and $448 million in 2008 under these repurchase programs. In addition to these repurchase programs, in December 1999 we began a program to repurchase common stock to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans. This program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises, and the tax benefit from these exercises. We repurchased approximately $40 million in 2010, $62 million in 2009 and $189 million in 2008 of Kroger stock under the stock option program. On March 3, 2011, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $1 billion stock repurchase program. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Capital expenditures, including changes in construction in progress payables and excluding acquisitions and the purchase of leased facilities, totaled $1.9 billion in 2010 compared to $2.2 billion in 2009 and $2.1 billion in 2008. The decrease in capital expenditures in 2010 was due to Kroger reducing the capital expenditures in our original plan in order to provide the cash flow necessary to execute our financial strategy. The increase in capital spending in 2009 compared to 2008 was the result of increasing our focus on merchandising and productivity projects. Capital expenditures for the purchase of leased facilities totaled $38 million in 2010 compared to $164 million for 2009 and $27 million for 2008. The decrease in capital expenditures for the purchase of leased facilities compared to 2009 was due to Kroger purchasing several more previously leased retail stores and one large distribution center in 2009 compared to 2010. The table below shows our supermarket storing activity and our total food store square footage: Supermarket Storing Activity 2010 2009 2008 Beginning of year 2,469 2,481 2,486 Opened 14 14 21 Opened (relocation) 6 9 14 Acquired 4 1 6 Acquired (relocation) 1 3 Closed (operational) (27 ) (27 ) (32 ) Closed (relocation) (6 ) (10 ) (17 ) End of year 2,460 2,469 2,481 Total food store square footage (in millions) 149 148 147 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position, and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 15 We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Self Insurance Costs We primarily are self insured for costs related to workers compensation and general liability claims. The liabilities represent our best estimate, using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods, of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through January 29, 2011. We establish case reserves for reported claims using case basis evaluation of the underlying claim data and we update as information becomes known. For both workers compensation and general liability claims, we have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis. We are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits. We account for the liabilities for workers compensation claims on a present value basis utilizing a risk adjusted discount rate. A 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase our liability by approximately $5 million. General liability claims are not discounted. We are also similarly self insured for property related losses. We have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to losses in excess of $25 million on a per claim basis, except in the case of an earthquake, for which stop loss coverage is in excess of $50 million per claim, up to $200 million per claim in California and $300 million outside of California. The assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability, which can affect the liability recorded for such claims. For example, variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized. Similarly, changes in legal trends and interpretations, as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can affect ultimate costs. Our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables, and any changes could have a considerable effect on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities. Impairments of Long Lived Assets We monitor the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger events have occurred. These events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset. When a trigger event occurs, we perform an impairment calculation, comparing projected undiscounted cash flows, utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores, to the carrying value for those stores. If we identify impairment for long lived assets to be held and used, we compare the assets current carrying value to the assets fair value. Fair value is determined based on market values or discounted future cash flows. We record impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value. With respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal, we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions. We recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value, reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal. We recorded asset impairments in the normal course of business totaling $25 million in 2010, $48 million in 2009 and $26 million in 2008. Included in the 2009 amount are asset impairments recorded totaling $24 million for a southern California reporting unit. We record costs to reduce the carrying value of long lived assets in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as Operating, general and administrative expense. The factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows. Our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation, the economy and market competition. Application of alternative assumptions and definitions, such as reviewing long lived assets for impairment at a different level, could produce significantly different results. Goodwill Our goodwill totaled $1.1 billion as of January 29, 2011. We review goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year, and also upon the occurrence of triggering events. We perform reviews of each of our operating divisions and variable interest entities (collectively, our reporting units) with goodwill balances. Fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings, or discounted projected future cash flows, and we compare fair value to the carrying value of a reporting unit for purposes of identifying potential impairment. We base projected future cash flows on managements knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future. If we identify potential for impairment, we measure the fair value of a reporting unit against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities, excluding goodwill, to estimate an implied fair value of the divisions goodwill. We recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of the carrying value of the divisions goodwill over the implied fair value. 16 The annual evaluation of goodwill performed during the fourth quarter of 2010 resulted in an impairment charge of $18 million. Based on the results of our step one analysis in the fourth quarter of 2010, a supermarket reporting unit with a small number of stores indicated potential impairment. Due to estimated future expected cash flows being lower than in the past, our estimated fair value of the reporting unit decreased. We concluded that the carrying value of goodwill for this reporting unit exceeded its implied fair value due to the decreased fair value of the reporting unit, resulting in a pre tax impairment charge of $18 million ($12 million after tax). In 2009, we disclosed that a 10% reduction in fair value of this supermarket reporting unit would indicate a potential for impairment. Subsequent to the impairment, no goodwill remains at this reporting unit. In the third quarter of 2009, our operating performance suffered due to deflation and intense competition. During the third quarter of 2009, based on revised forecasts for 2009 and the initial results of our annual budget process of the supermarket reporting units, management believed that there were circumstances evident to warrant impairment testing of these reporting units. In the third quarter of 2009, we did not test the variable interest entities with recorded goodwill for impairment as no triggering event occurred. Based on the results of our step one analysis in the third quarter of 2009, the Ralphs reporting unit in Southern California was the only reporting unit for which there was a potential impairment. In 2009, the operating performance of the Ralphs reporting unit was significantly affected by the economic conditions at the time and responses to competitive actions in Southern California. As a result of this decline in current and future expected cash flows, along with comparable fair value information, management concluded that the carrying value of goodwill for the Ralphs reporting unit exceeded its implied fair value, resulting in a pre tax impairment charge of $1,113 ($1,036 after tax). Subsequent to the impairment, no goodwill remains at the Ralphs reporting unit. Management used an equal weighting of discounted cash flows and a sales weighted EBITDA multiple to estimate fair value. The discounted cash flows assume long term sales growth rates comparable to historical performance and a discount rate of 11%. In addition, the EBITDA multiples observed in the marketplace declined since those used in the January 31, 2009 assessment. Based on current and future expected cash flows, the Company believes additional goodwill impairments are not reasonably possible. A 10% reduction in fair value of the Companys reporting units would not indicate a potential for impairment of the Companys remaining goodwill balance, except for one non supermarket reporting unit with recorded goodwill of $77. The fair value of this reporting unit was estimated using discounted cash flows. The discounted cash flows assume long term sales growth rates comparable to historical performances and a discount rate of 12.5%. For additional information relating to our results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during 2010, 2009 and 2008 see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The impairment review requires the extensive use of management judgment and financial estimates. Application of alternative estimates and assumptions, such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different level, could produce significantly different results. The cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several factors such as inflation, business valuations in the market, the economy and market competition. Store Closing Costs We provide for closed store liabilities on the basis of the present value of the estimated remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date, net of estimated subtenant income. We estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores. We usually pay closed store lease liabilities over the lease terms associated with the closed stores, which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to 20 years. Adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates. We make adjustments for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known. We review store closing liabilities quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs, or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose, is adjusted to earnings in the proper period. We estimate subtenant income, future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located, our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions. The ultimate cost of the disposition of the leases and the related assets is affected by current real estate markets, inflation rates and general economic conditions. We reduce owned stores held for disposal to their estimated net realizable value. We account for costs to reduce the carrying values of property, equipment and leasehold improvements in accordance with our policy on impairment of long lived assets. We classify inventory write downs in connection with store closings, if any, in Merchandise costs. We expense costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores as they are incurred. 17 Post Retirement Benefit Plans (a) Company sponsored defined benefit Pension Plans We account for our defined benefit pension plans using the recognition and disclosure provisions of GAAP, which require the recognition of the funded status of retirement plans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We record, as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI), actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that have not yet been recognized. The determination of our obligation and expense for Company sponsored pension plans and other post retirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts. Those assumptions are described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and include, among others, the discount rate, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, average life expectancy and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions, including the discount rate used and the expected return on plan assets, may materially affect our pension and other post retirement obligations and our future expense. Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements discusses the effect of a 1% change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other post retirement benefit costs and the related liability. The objective of our discount rate assumptions was intended to reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. In making this determination, we take into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans. Our methodology for selecting the discount rates as of year end 2010 was to match the plans cash flows to that of a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zero coupon corporate bonds for each maturity. Benefit cash flows due in a particular year can theoretically be settled by investing them in the zero coupon bond that matures in the same year. The discount rates are the single rates that produce the same present value of cash flows. The selection of the 5.60% and 5.40% discount rates as of year end 2010 for pension and other benefits, respectively, represent the equivalent single rates constructed under a broad market AA yield curve. We utilized a discount rate of 6.00% and 5.80% for year end 2009 for pension and other benefits, respectively. A 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the projected pension benefit obligation as of January 29, 2011, by approximately $342 million. To determine the expected rate of return on pension plan assets, we consider current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted rates of return on various asset categories. For 2010 and 2009, we assumed a pension plan investment return rate of 8.5%. Our pension plans average rate of return was 6.6% for the 10 calendar years ended December 31, 2010, net of all investment management fees and expenses. The value of all investments in our Company sponsored defined benefit pension plans during the calendar year ending December 31, 2010, net of investment management fees and expenses, increased 15.0%, primarily due to the strength of the market in 2010. For the past 20 years, our average annual rate of return has been 10.7%. The average annual return for the S&P 500 over the same period of time has been 9.9%. Based on the above information and forward looking assumptions for investments made in a manner consistent with our target allocations, we believe an 8.5% rate of return assumption is reasonable. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the asset allocations of pension plan assets. Sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions used in the calculation of Krogers pension plan liabilities for the qualified plans is illustrated below (in millions). Percentage Point Change Projected Benefit Obligation Decrease/(Increase) Expense Decrease/(Increase) Discount Rate +/ 1.0 % $ 342/(414) $ 28/($33) Expected Return on Assets +/ 1.0 % $ 23/($23) We contributed $141 million in 2010, $265 million in 2009 and $20 million in 2008 to our Company sponsored defined benefit pension plans. We do not expect to make a cash contribution to our Company sponsored defined benefit pension plans in 2011. Contributions may be made if required under the Pension Protection Act to avoid any benefit restrictions. We expect any contributions made during 2011 will decrease our required contributions in future years. Among other things, investment performance of plan assets, the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations, and future changes in legislation, will determine the amounts of any contributions. 18 We contributed and expensed $119 million in 2010, $115 million in 2009 and $92 million in 2008 to employee 401(k) retirement savings accounts. The 401(k) retirement savings account plans provide to eligible employees both matching contributions and automatic contributions from the Company based on participant contributions, plan compensation, and length of service. (b) Multi Employer Plans We also contribute to various multi employer pension plans based on obligations arising from most of our collective bargaining agreements. These plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers. The benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose. Trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions. The trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans. We recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded, in accordance with GAAP. We made contributions to these plans, and recognized expense, of $262 million in 2010, $233 million in 2009 and $219 million in 2008. Based on the most recent information available to us, we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most or all of these multi employer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits. We have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets, (i.e., the amount of underfunding), as of December 31, 2010. Because Kroger is only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans, we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of Krogers contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing Krogers share of the underfunding. Nonetheless, the underfunding is not a direct obligation or liability of Kroger or of any employer. As of December 31, 2010, we estimate that Krogers share of the underfunding of multi employer plans to which Kroger contributes was $2.5 billion, pre tax, or $1.6 billion, after tax. This represents a decrease in the estimated amount of underfunding of approximately $125 million, pre tax, or $75 million, after tax, as of December 31, 2010, compared to December 31, 2009. The decrease in the amount of underfunding is attributable to the strength of the market during the last year and benefit reductions. Our estimate is based on the most current information available to us including actuarial evaluations and other data (that include the estimates of others), and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable. We have made and disclosed this estimate not because this underfunding is a direct liability of Kroger. Rather, we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences. In 2010, our contributions to these plans increased approximately 12% over the prior year and have grown at a compound annual rate of approximately 7% since 2005. In 2011, we expect to contribute approximately $300 million to our multi employer pension plans, subject to collective bargaining and capital market conditions. Based on current market conditions, we expect meaningful increases in funding and in expense as a result of increases in multi employer pension plan contributions over the next few years. Finally, underfunding means that, in the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these funds, we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability. Any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated, in accordance with GAAP. The amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and could change based on contract negotiations, returns on the assets held in the multi employer plans and benefit payments. The amount could decline, and Krogers future expense would be favorably affected, if the values of the assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining, trustee action or favorable legislation. On the other hand, Krogers share of the underfunding could increase and Krogers future expense could be adversely affected if the asset values decline, if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining, trustee action or adverse legislation. Deferred Rent We recognize rent holidays, including the time period during which we have access to the property for construction of buildings or improvements, as well as construction allowances and escalating rent provisions on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. The deferred amount is included in Other Current Liabilities and Other Long Term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Uncertain Tax Positions We review the tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns to determine whether and to what extent a benefit can be recognized in our consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and other related disclosures related to uncertain tax positions. 19 Various taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions, including state and local taxes, we record allowances for probable exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which an allowance has been established, is audited and fully resolved. As of January 29, 2011, the most recent examination concluded by the Internal Revenue Service covered the years 2005 through 2007. The assessment of our tax position relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. Share Based Compensation Expense We account for stock options under the fair value recognition provisions of GAAP. Under this method, we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments granted. We recognize share based compensation expense, net of an estimated forfeiture rate, over the requisite service period of the award. In addition, we record expense for restricted stock awards in an amount equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date of the award, over the period the award restrictions lapse. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (principally on a LIFO basis) or market. In total, approximately 97% of inventories were valued using the LIFO method in both 2010 and 2009. Cost for the balance of the inventories was determined using the FIFO method. Replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by $827 million at January 29, 2011, and by $770 million at January 30, 2010. We follow the Link Chain, Dollar Value LIFO method for purposes of calculating our LIFO charge or credit. We follow the item cost method of accounting to determine inventory cost before the LIFO adjustment for substantially all store inventories at our supermarket divisions. This method involves counting each item in inventory, assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs (net of vendor allowances and cash discounts) of each item and recording the cost of items sold. The item cost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory and purchasing levels when compared to the methodology followed under the retail method of accounting. We evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities. We record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date. Vendor Allowances We recognize all vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs when the related product is sold. In most cases, vendor allowances are applied to the related product cost by item, and therefore reduce the carrying value of inventory by item. When it is not practicable to allocate vendor allowances to the product by item, we recognize vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs based on inventory turns and as the product is sold. We recognized approximately $6.4 billion in 2010, $5.7 billion in 2009 and $5.2 billion in 2008 of vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs. All years presented now include amounts for certain vendor funded electronic promotions. We recognized approximately 95% of all vendor allowances in the item cost with the remainder being based on inventory turns. 20 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flow Information Net cash provided by operating activities We generated $3.4 billion of cash from operations in 2010 compared to $2.9 billion in 2009 and 2008. The cash provided by operating activities came from net earnings including noncontrolling interests adjusted primarily for non cash expenses of depreciation and amortization, the goodwill impairment charge, and changes in working capital. Changes in working capital provided cash from operating activities of $698 million in 2010, compared to $(83) million in 2009 and $(421) million in 2008. The change in working capital for 2010, compared to 2009, was primarily due to increases in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses and a decrease in prepaid expenses. In addition, the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2010, compared to 2009, was partially offset by a decrease in other long term liabilities. Prepaid expenses decreased in 2010, compared to 2009 and 2008, due to Kroger not prefunding $300 million of employee benefits in 2010. The increase in the change in working capital for 2009, compared to 2008, was primarily due to a decrease in the net income taxes receivable and payable along with a slight increase in inventory in 2009, compared to a larger increase in inventory in 2008. These amounts are also net of cash contributions to our Company sponsored defined benefit pension plans totaling $141 million in 2010, $265 million in 2009 and $20 million in 2008. The amount of cash paid for income taxes increased in 2010, compared to 2009, due to reversals of temporary differences in 2010 and overpayments being applied to 2009 income taxes. The amount decreased in 2009, compared to 2008, due to applying our fiscal 2008 overpayment of income taxes to 2009 income taxes. Net cash used by investing activities Cash used by investing activities was $2.0 billion in 2010, compared to $2.3 billion in 2009 and $2.2 billion in 2008. The amount of cash used by investing activities decreased in 2010, compared to 2009, due primarily to decreased payments on capital expenditures. The amount of cash used by investing activities increased in 2009, compared to 2008, due primarily to higher capital spending, partially offset by decreased payments for acquisitions. Capital expenditures, including changes in construction in progress payables and excluding acquisitions, were $1.9 billion in 2010, $2.3 billion in 2009 and $2.2 billion in 2008. Refer to the Capital Expenditures section for an overview of our supermarket storing activity during the last three years. Net cash used by financing activities Financing activities used $1.0 billion of cash in 2010 compared to $434 million in 2009 and $769 million in 2008. The increase in the amount of cash used for financing activities in 2010, compared to 2009, was primarily related to the increased payments on long term debt and treasury stock repurchases, decreased proceeds from the issuance of long term debt, and an investment in the remaining interest of a variable interest entity, partially offset by decreased payments on the credit facility. The decrease in the amount of cash used for financing activities in 2009, compared to 2008, was primarily related to the decrease in the amount of treasury stock purchased and payments on long term debt and our credit facility, offset by decreased proceeds from the issuance of long term debt and capital stock. We repurchased $545 million of Kroger stock in 2010 compared to $218 million in 2009 and $637 million in 2008. We paid dividends totaling $250 million in 2010, $238 million in 2009 and $227 million in 2008. Debt Management Total debt, including both the current and long term portions of capital leases and lease financing obligations, decreased $164 million to $7.9 billion as of year end 2010, compared to year end 2009. The decrease in 2010, compared to 2009, resulted from the payment at maturity of our $500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 8.05%, offset by the issuance of $300 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 5.40%. Total debt decreased $7 million to $8.1 billion as of year end 2009, compared to year end 2008. The decrease in 2009, compared to 2008, resulted from the payment at maturity of our $350 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 7.25%, decreased outstanding commercial paper and payments on our money market lines, offset by the issuance of $500 million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 3.90%. Our total debt balances were also affected by our prefunding of employee benefit costs and by the mark to market adjustments necessary to record fair value interest rate hedges on our fixed rate debt. We had prefunded employee benefit costs of $300 million in each of the two years ended 2009 and 2008. The mark to market adjustments increased the carrying value of our debt by $57 million in both 2010 and 2009. 21 Liquidity Needs We estimate our liquidity needs over the next twelve month period to be approximately $2.0 billion, which includes anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, interest payments, and scheduled principal payments of debt, offset by cash and temporary cash investments on hand at the end of fiscal year 2010. Based on current operating trends, we believe that cash flows from operating activities and other sources of liquidity, including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility, will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future beyond the next twelve months. In addition to the sources of liquidity noted above, we also expect to be able to fund future scheduled principal payments of long term debt from our cash flows from operating activities and, if necessary, by issuing additional debt. We believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to maintain our current debt ratings and to respond effectively to competitive conditions. Factors Affecting Liquidity We can currently borrow on a daily basis approximately $1 billion under our commercial paper (CP) program. At January 29, 2011, we did not have any CP borrowings outstanding. CP borrowings are backed by our credit facility, and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility. If our short term credit ratings fall, the ability to borrow under our current CP program could be adversely affected for a period of time and increase our interest cost on daily borrowings under our CP program. This could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility, under which we believe we have sufficient capacity. However, in the event of a ratings decline, we do not anticipate that our borrowing capacity under our CP program would be any lower than $500 million on a daily basis. Although our ability to borrow under the credit facility is not affected by our credit rating, the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facility could be affected by an increase in our credit default swap spread or an increase in our Leverage Ratio. Our credit facility also requires the maintenance of a Leverage Ratio and a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (our financial covenants). A failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facility. These financial covenants and ratios are described below: Our Leverage Ratio (the ratio of Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the credit facility) was 1.95 to 1 as of January 29, 2011. If this ratio exceeded 3.50 to 1, we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired. In addition, our Applicable Margin on borrowings is determined by our Leverage Ratio. Our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA plus Consolidated Rental Expense to Consolidated Cash Interest Expense plus Consolidated Rental Expense, as defined in the credit facility) was 4.03 to 1 as of January 29, 2011. If this ratio fell below 1.70 to 1, we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired. Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in our credit facility, includes an adjustment for unusual gains and losses including our non cash asset impairment charges related to goodwill in 2010 and 2009. Our credit agreement is more fully described in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We were in compliance with our financial covenants at year end 2010. 22 The tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments, based on year of maturity or settlement, as of January 29, 2011 (in millions of dollars): 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations (1) (2) Long term debt(3) $ 549 $ 905 $ 1,520 $ 308 $ 516 $ 3,636 $ 7,434 Interest on long term debt (4) 408 377 330 274 259 2,385 4,033 Capital lease obligations 60 50 47 43 38 186 424 Operating lease obligations 741 698 651 597 529 2,498 5,714 Low income housing obligations 12 6 2 20 Financed lease obligations 14 14 14 14 14 158 228 Self insurance liability (5) 181 119 78 51 27 58 514 Construction commitments 163 163 Purchase obligations 552 85 37 18 16 23 731 Total $ 2,680 $ 2,254 $ 2,679 $ 1,305 $ 1,399 $ 8,944 $ 19,261 Other Commercial Commitments Standby letters of credit $ 252 $ $ $ $ $ $ 252 Surety bonds 348 348 Guarantees 7 7 Total $ 607 $ $ $ $ $ $ 607 (1) The contractual obligations table excludes funding of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, which totaled approximately $165 million in 2010. This table also excludes contributions under various multi employer pension plans, which totaled $262 million in 2010. (2) The liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing of future tax settlements cannot be determined. (3) We did not have any borrowings under our credit facility as of January 29, 2011. (4) Amounts include contractual interest payments using the interest rate as of January 29, 2011, and stated fixed and swapped interest rates, if applicable, for all other debt instruments. (5) The amounts included in the contractual obligations table for self insurance liability have been stated on a present value basis. Our construction commitments include funds owed to third parties for projects currently under construction. These amounts are reflected in other current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our purchase obligations include commitments to be utilized in the normal course of business, such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our manufacturing plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and manufacturing facilities. Our obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties. Any upfront vendor allowances or incentives associated with outstanding purchase commitments are recorded as either current or long term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of January 29, 2011, we maintained a $2 billion, unsecured revolving credit facility that, unless extended, terminates on May 15, 2014. Outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and commercial paper borrowings, and some outstanding letters of credit, reduce funds available under the credit agreement. In addition to the credit agreement, we maintained three uncommitted money market lines totaling $100 million in the aggregate. The money market lines allow us to borrow from banks at mutually agreed upon rates, usually at rates below the rates offered under the credit agreement. As of January 29, 2011, we had no borrowings under our credit agreement, money market lines or outstanding commercial paper. The outstanding letters of credit that reduce funds available under our credit agreement totaled $134 million as of January 29, 2011. In addition to the available credit mentioned above, as of January 29, 2011, we had authorized for issuance $2 billion of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC and effective on December 15, 2010. 23 We also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our self insured workers compensation claims. These bonds are required by most states in which we are self insured for workers compensation and are placed with third party insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to meet our claim payment obligations up to our self insured retention levels. These bonds do not represent liabilities of Kroger, as we already have reserves on our books for the claims costs. Market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and, in some instances, availability of these bonds may become more limited, which could affect our costs of, or access to, such bonds. Although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly affect our ability to access these surety bonds, if this does become an issue, we would issue letters of credit, in states where allowed, against our credit facility to meet the state bonding requirements. This could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facility. We have guaranteed half of the indebtedness of two real estate entities in which we have a 50% ownership interest. Our share of the responsibility for this indebtedness, should the entities be unable to meet their obligations, totals approximately $7 million. Based on the covenants underlying this indebtedness as of January 29, 2011, we believe that it is unlikely that we will be responsible for repayment of these obligations. We also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions. We could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations. Due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties, and various other remedies available to us, we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote. We have agreed to indemnify certain third party logistics operators for certain expenses, including pension trust fund contribution obligations and withdrawal liabilities. In addition to the above, we enter into various indemnification agreements and take on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business. Such arrangements include indemnities against third party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to Kroger; indemnities related to the sale of our securities; indemnities of directors, officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work; and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans. While Krogers aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability, we are not aware of any current matter that could result in a material liability. RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In January 2010, the FASB amended its standards related to fair value measurements and disclosures, which were effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for disclosures about certain Level 3 activity that will become effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2010. The new standards require us to disclose transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers as well as activity in Level 3 fair value measurements. The new standards also require a more detailed level of disaggregation of the assets and liabilities being measured as well as increased disclosures regarding inputs and valuation techniques of the fair value measurements. We adopted the amended standards effective January 31, 2010, except for disclosures about certain Level 3 activity, which will be effective starting January 30, 2011. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our fair value measurements and disclosures. In June 2009, the FASB amended its existing standards related to the consolidation of VIEs, which was effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after November 15, 2009. The new standards require an entity to analyze whether its variable interests give it a controlling financial interest of a VIE and outlines what defines a primary beneficiary. The new standards amend GAAP by: (a) changing certain rules for determining whether an entity is a VIE; (b) replacing the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary with a more qualitative approach; and (c) requiring entities to continuously analyze whether they are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, among other amendments. The new standards also require enhanced disclosures regarding an entitys involvement in a VIE. We adopted the amended standards effective January 31, 2010. The adoption of these new standards did not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective February 1, 2009, we adopted the new standards that clarify that share based payment awards that entitle their holders to receive nonforfeitable dividends before vesting should be considered participating securities and included in the computation of EPS pursuant to the two class method. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of its adoption. 24 OUTLOOK This discussion and analysis contains certain forward looking statements about Krogers future performance. These statements are based on managements assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available. Such statements relate to, among other things: projected changes in net earnings attributable to The Kroger Co.; identical supermarket sales growth; expected product cost; expected pension plan contributions; our ability to generate operating cash flow; projected capital expenditures; square footage growth; opportunities to reduce costs; cash flow requirements; and our operating plan for the future; and are indicated by words such as comfortable, committed, will, expect, goal, should, intend, target, believe, anticipate, plan, and similar words or phrases. These forward looking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations, projections, beliefs, intentions or strategies are forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. While we believe that the statements are accurate, uncertainties about the general economy, our labor relations, our ability to execute our plans on a timely basis and other uncertainties described below could cause actual results to differ materially. We expect net earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.80 $1.92 for 2011. We expect the second and third quarter earnings per diluted share growth rate to be below the annual growth rate due to tax benefits recognized in 2010. The growth in the second quarter is expected to be the lowest of the year. We expect identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel sales, of 3.0% 4.0% in 2011. For 2011, we will continue to focus on improving sales growth, in accordance with our Customer 1st strategy, by making investments in gross margin and customer shopping experiences. We expect to finance these investments primarily with operating cost reductions. We expect non fuel operating margins for 2011 to be comparable to 2010, excluding the non cash goodwill impairment charge. For 2011, we expect fuel margins, which can be highly volatile, to be approximately $0.115 per gallon, and we expect continued strong growth in fuel gallons sold. For 2011, we expect our annualized LIFO charge to be approximately $50 million to $75 million. This forecast is based on estimated cost changes for products in our inventory. For 2011, we expect interest expense to be approximately $460 million. We plan to use cash flow primarily for capital investments, to maintain our current debt coverage ratios, to pay cash dividends, and to repurchase stock. As market conditions change, we re evaluate these uses of cash flow. We expect to obtain sales growth from new square footage, as well as from increased productivity from existing locations. Capital expenditures reflect our strategy of growth through expansion, as well as focusing on productivity increases from our existing store base through remodels. In addition, we will continue our emphasis on self development and ownership of real estate, logistics and technology improvements. The continued capital spending in technology is focused on improving store operations, logistics, manufacturing procurement, category management, merchandising and buying practices, and should reduce merchandising costs. We intend to continue using cash flow from operations to finance capital expenditure requirements. We expect capital investments for 2011 to be in the range of $1.7 $1.9 billion, excluding acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities. We expect total food store square footage to grow approximately 1.0% 1.5% before acquisitions and operational closings. Based on current operating trends, we believe that cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity, including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility, will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, interest payments and scheduled principal payments for the foreseeable future. We also believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to respond effectively to competitive conditions. We believe we have adequate sources of cash, if needed, under our credit facility and other borrowing sources. 25 We expect that our OG&A results will be affected by increased costs, such as higher employee benefit costs and credit card fees, offset by improved productivity from process changes and leverage gained through sales increases. We expect that our effective tax rate for 2011 will be approximately 36.0%, excluding the resolution of any tax issues. We expect rent expense, as a percentage of total sales and excluding closed store activity, will decrease due to the emphasis our current strategy places on ownership of real estate. We believe that in 2011 there will be opportunities to reduce our operating costs in such areas as administration, productivity improvements, shrink, warehousing and transportation. We intend to invest most of these savings in our core business to drive profitable sales growth and offer improved value and shopping experiences for our customers. We do not expect to make a cash contribution to the Company sponsored defined benefit pension plans during 2011. If a contribution is made to the Company sponsored defined benefit pension plans, we expect any elective contributions made during 2011 will decrease our required contributions in future years. Among other things, investment performance of plan assets, the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations, and future changes in legislation, will determine the amounts of any additional contributions. We expect 2011 expense for Company sponsored defined benefit pension plans to be approximately $80 million. In addition, we expect 401(k) Retirement Savings Account Plan cash contributions and expense from automatic and matching contributions to participants to increase slightly in 2011, compared to 2010. We expect to contribute approximately $300 million to multi employer pension plans in 2011, subject to collective bargaining. In addition, we expect meaningful increases in expense as a result of increases in multi employer pension plan contributions over the next few years. We do not anticipate additional goodwill impairments in 2011. We have various labor agreements that will be negotiated in 2011, covering store employees in southern California, Memphis and West Virginia. We will also negotiate agreements with the Teamsters who represent some of our associates in distribution and manufacturing operation in the Midwest. Upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements, work stoppages by the affected workers could occur if we are unable to negotiate new contracts with labor unions. A prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our results. In all of these contracts, rising health care and pension costs will continue to be an important issue in negotiations. We expect our business model to produce annual earnings per diluted share growth on average of 6.0% to 8.0% over each rolling three to five year time period. Including our dividend, our business model is expected to generate total shareholder return on average of 8.0% to 10.0% over each rolling three to five year time period. Various uncertainties and other factors could cause us to fail to achieve our goals. These include: The extent to which our sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet our requirements may be affected by the state of the financial markets and the effect that such condition has on our ability to issue commercial paper at acceptable rates. Our ability to borrow under our committed lines of credit, including our bank credit facilities, could be impaired if one or more of our lenders under those lines is unwilling or unable to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us. Changes in market conditions could affect our cash flow. 26 Our ability to achieve sales and earnings goals may be affected by: labor disputes; industry consolidation; pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors, including non traditional competitors, and the aggressiveness of that competition; our response to these actions; the state of the economy, including interest rates, the inflationary and deflationary trends in certain commodities, and the unemployment rate; the effect that increased fuel costs have on consumer spending; changes in government funded benefit programs; manufacturing commodity costs; diesel fuel costs related to our logistics operations; trends in consumer spending; the extent to which our customers exercise caution in their purchasing in response to economic conditions; the inconsistent pace of the economic recovery; changes in inflation or deflation in product and operating costs; stock repurchases; and the success of our future growth plans. Our ability to achieve sales and earnings goals may also be affected by our ability to manage the factors identified above. The extent to which the adjustments we are making to our strategy create value for our shareholders will depend primarily on the reaction of our customers and our competitors to these adjustments, as well as operating conditions, including inflation or deflation, increased competitive activity, and cautious spending behavior of our customers. Our product cost inflation could vary from our estimate due to general economic conditions, weather, availability of raw materials and ingredients in the products that we sell and their packaging, and other factors beyond our control. Our ability to use free cash flow to continue to maintain our debt coverage and to reward our shareholders could be affected by unanticipated increases in net total debt, our inability to generate free cash flow at the levels anticipated, and our failure to generate expected earnings. The timing of our recognition of LIFO expense will be affected primarily by changes in product costs during the year. If actual results differ significantly from anticipated future results for certain reporting units including variable interest entities, an impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value would have to be recognized. In addition to the factors identified above, our identical store sales growth could be affected by increases in Kroger private label sales, the effect of our sister stores (new stores opened in close proximity to an existing store) and reductions in retail pricing. Our operating margins, without fuel, could decline more than expected if we are unable to pass on any cost increases, fail to deliver the cost savings contemplated or if changes in the cost of our inventory and the timing of those changes differ from our expectations. We could fail to realize our expected operating margin per gallon of fuel and fuel gallons sold based upon changes in the price of fuel, a change in our operating costs, or if a pattern of rapid changes in fuel costs occurs. We have estimated our exposure to the claims and litigation arising in the normal course of business, as well as to the material litigation facing Kroger, and believe we have made provisions where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable. Unexpected outcomes in these matters, however, could result in an adverse effect on our earnings. Consolidation in the food industry is likely to continue and the effects on our business, either favorable or unfavorable, cannot be foreseen. Rent expense, which includes subtenant rental income, could be adversely affected by the state of the economy, increased store closure activity and future consolidation. Depreciation expense, which includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital leases, is computed principally using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of individual assets, or the remaining terms of leases. Use of the straight line method of depreciation creates a risk that future asset write offs or potential impairment charges related to store closings would be larger than if an accelerated method of depreciation were followed. Our effective tax rate may differ from the expected rate due to changes in laws, the status of pending items with various taxing authorities, and the deductibility of certain expenses. 27 The actual amount of automatic and matching cash contributions to our 401(k) Retirement Savings Account Plan will depend on the number of participants, savings rate, plan compensation, and length of service of participants. Our contributions and recorded expense related to multi employer pension funds could increase more than anticipated. Should asset values in these funds deteriorate, if employers withdraw from these funds without providing for their share of the liability, or should our estimates prove to be understated, our contributions could increase more rapidly than we have anticipated. If volatility in the financial markets continues or worsens, our contributions to Company sponsored defined benefit pension plans could increase more than anticipated in future years. Changes in laws or regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements and environmental laws may have a material effect on our financial statements. Changes in the general business and economic conditions in our operating regions may affect the shopping habits of our customers, which could affect sales and earnings. Changes in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial indicators. For example, we continue to add supermarket fuel centers to our store base. Since gasoline generates low profit margins, we expect to see our FIFO gross profit margins decline as gasoline sales increase. Although this negatively affects our FIFO gross margin, gasoline sales provide a positive effect on OG&A expense as a percentage of sales. Our capital expenditures, expected square footage growth, and number of store projects completed over the next fiscal year could differ from our estimate if we are unsuccessful in acquiring suitable sites for new stores, if development costs vary from those budgeted, if our logistics and technology or store projects are not completed on budget or within the time frame projected, or if economic conditions fail to improve, or worsen. Interest expense could be adversely affected by the interest rate environment, changes in our credit ratings, fluctuations in the amount of outstanding debt, decisions to incur prepayment penalties on the early redemption of debt and any factor that adversely affects our operations and results in an increase in debt. Impairment losses, including goodwill, could be affected by changes in our assumptions of future cash flows, market values or business valuations in the market. Our cash flow projections include several years of projected cash flows which would be affected by changes in the economic environment, real estate market values, competitive activity, inflation and customer behavior. Our estimated expense and obligation for Kroger sponsored pension plans and other post retirement benefits could be affected by changes in the assumptions used in calculating those amounts. These assumptions include, among others, the discount rate, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, average life expectancy and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs. Adverse weather conditions could increase the cost our suppliers charge for their products, or may decrease customer demand for certain products. Increases in demand for certain commodities could also increase the cost our suppliers charge for their products. Additionally, increases in the cost of inputs, such as utility costs or raw material costs, could negatively affect financial ratios and earnings. Although we presently operate only in the United States, civil unrest in foreign countries in which our suppliers do business may affect the prices we are charged for imported goods. If we are unable to pass on these increases to our customers, our FIFO gross margin and net earnings would suffer. Earnings and sales also may be affected by adverse weather conditions, particularly to the extent that hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, and other conditions disrupt our operations or those of our suppliers; create shortages in the availability or increases in the cost of products that we sell in our stores or materials and ingredients we use in our manufacturing facilities; or raise the cost of supplying energy to our various operations. 28 Other factors and assumptions not identified above could also cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking information. Accordingly, actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in, contemplated or implied by forward looking statements made by us or our representatives. 29 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Financial Risk Management We use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. As a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure. Because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure, fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure. The interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets. We manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of variable and fixed rate debt, and interest rate swaps. Our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. To do this, we use the following guidelines: (i) use average daily outstanding borrowings to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure, (ii) limit the average annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of $2.5 billion or less, (iii) include no leveraged products, and (iv) hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current mark to market status. As of January 29, 2011, we maintained 18 interest rate swap agreements, with notional amounts totaling $1.6 billion, to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates. These agreements mature at varying times between April 2012 and April 2013, and coincide with our scheduled debt maturities. The differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense. These interest rate swap agreements are being accounted for as fair value hedges. As of January 29, 2011, other long term assets totaling $45 million were recorded to reflect the fair value of these agreements, primarily offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying debt. We have unamortized proceeds from twelve interest rate swaps once classified as fair value hedges totaling approximately $16 million. The unamortized proceeds are recorded as adjustments to the carrying values of the underlying debt and are being amortized over the remaining term of the debt. In addition to the interest rate swaps noted above, in 2005 we entered into three forward starting interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount totaling $750 million. A forward starting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges future benchmark interest rates on debt for an established period of time. We entered into the forward starting interest rate swaps in order to lock into fixed interest rates on forecasted issuances of debt in 2007 and 2008. In 2007, we terminated two of these forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $500 million. In 2008, we terminated the remaining forward interest rate swap with a notional amount of $250 million. As of January 29, 2011, the unamortized payments and proceeds of $8 million ($5 million net of tax) on these terminated forward starting interest rate swaps have been recorded net of tax in other comprehensive income and will be amortized to earnings as the payments of interest to which the hedge relates are made. Annually, we review with the Financial Policy Committee of our Board of Directors compliance with the guidelines described above. The guidelines may change as our business needs dictate. The tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives and underlying debt portfolio as of January 29, 2011. The amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of long term debt, excluding capital leases, and the average outstanding notional amounts of interest rate derivatives as of January 29, 2011. Interest rates reflect the weighted average rate for the outstanding instruments. The variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on U.S. dollar LIBOR using the forward yield curve as of January 29, 2011. The Fair Value column includes the fair value of our debt instruments and interest rate derivatives as of January 29, 2011. Refer to Notes 5, 6 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 30 Expected Year of Maturity 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total Fair Value (In millions) Debt Fixed rate $ (491 ) $ (850 ) $ (1,509 ) $ (308 ) $ (507 ) $ (3,528 ) $ (7,193 ) $ (7,950 ) Average interest rate 6.34 % 6.30 % 6.29 % 6.36 % 6.56 % 6.87 % Variable rate $ (58 ) $ (55 ) $ (11 ) $ $ (9 ) $ (108 ) $ (241 ) $ (241 ) Average interest rate 2.46 % 1.23 % 2.11 % 2.16 % 3.57 % 4.04 % Average Notional Amounts Outstanding January 29, 2011 January 29, 2011 Fair 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total Value (In millions) Interest Rate Derivatives Fixed to variable $ 1,625 $ 1,067 $ 78 $ $ $ $ 1,625 $ 45 Average pay rate 3.83 % 3.67 % 3.98 % Average receive rate 5.87 % 5.51 % 5.00 % Commodity Price Protection We enter into purchase commitments for various resources, including raw materials utilized in our manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in our stores, warehouses, manufacturing facilities and administrative offices. We enter into commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of normal business. Those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in the normal course of business qualify as normal purchases. 31
