Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations The Companys net income increased $147.7 million or 29.8% from $495.7 million in fiscal 2001 to $643.4 million in fiscal 2002. Net income increased $123.6 million or 33.2% in fiscal 2001 and $114.0 million or 44.2% in fiscal 2000. Net Sales. Net sales, number of stores, sales growth and net sales per selling square foot by year for the last three fiscal years were as follows: Fiscal Year 2002 2001 2000 Net sales (in thousands) $ 9,120,287 $ 7,488,654 $ 6,151,996 Number of stores open (end of period) 457 382 320 Sales growth all stores 21.8 % 21.7 % 35.0 % Sales growth comparable stores (a) 5.3 % 6.8 % 9.0 % Net sales per selling square foot (b) $ 284 $ 283 $ 281 (a) Comparable store sales growth for each period is based on sales of stores (including relocated or expanded stores) open throughout the full period and throughout the full prior fiscal year. Fiscal 2001 comparable sales growth compares the 52 weeks of fiscal 2001 to the 52 weeks ended January 27, 2001. Fiscal 2000 comparable sales growth was calculated based on the 52 weeks ended January 27, 2001 versus the 52 weeks of fiscal 1999. (b) Net sales per selling square foot is calculated using net sales of stores that have been open for the full year divided by their square footage of selling space. Increases in net sales primarily reflect new store openings and comparable store sales growth. On a fiscal year basis, net sales increased $1,631.6 million, or 21.8%, from $7,488.7 million in fiscal 2001 to $9,120.3 million in fiscal 2002. Net sales increased $1,275.9 million due to the opening of 75 new stores in fiscal 2002 and to the inclusion of a full year of operating results for the 62 stores opened in fiscal 2001. Comparable store sales increased $355.7 million, or 5.3%, in fiscal 2002. In fiscal 2002, the comparable store base included 320 stores. On a fiscal year basis, comparing the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2002, with the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2001, net sales increased $1,336.7 million, or 21.7%, from $6,152.0 million in fiscal 2000 to $7,488.7 million in fiscal 2001. Net sales increased $1,039.4 million due to the opening of 62 new stores in fiscal 2001 and to the inclusion of a full year of sales for the 61 stores opened in fiscal 2000. Comparing the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2002 with the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2001, the Companys comparable store sales increased $297.3 million or 5.6%. On a comparable 52 week basis, comparable store sales increased 6.8% in fiscal 2001. In fiscal 2001, the comparable store base included 259 stores. 9 Components of Earnings. The following table sets forth statement of operations data as a percentage of net sales for each of the last three years: Fiscal Year 2002 2001 2000 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of merchandise sold 65.6 65.7 65.9 Gross margin 34.4 34.3 34.1 Selling, general and administrative expenses 19.9 20.4 20.8 Depreciation and amortization 2.1 2.1 2.1 Preopening expenses 0.4 0.4 0.6 Operating income 12.0 11.4 10.6 Interest expense, net 0.6 0.7 0.8 Income before income taxes 11.4 10.7 9.8 Provision for income taxes 4.3 4.1 3.8 Net income 7.1 % 6.6 % 6.0 % Gross Margin. Gross margin increased $574.0 million from $2,565.1 million in fiscal 2001 to $3,139.1 million in fiscal 2002. Gross margin increased $419.2 million due to the opening of 75 new stores in fiscal 2002 and to the inclusion of a full year of operating results for the 62 stores opened in fiscal 2001. Comparable store gross margin increased $154.8 million. The Companys gross margin as a percent of net sales was 34.4% for fiscal 2002 compared to 34.3% for fiscal 2001. The increase in gross margin rate is attributable to improved gross margin rates in most merchandise categories and a favorable change in the sales mix. Gross margin increased $469.2 million from $2,095.9 million in fiscal 2000 to $2,565.1 million in fiscal 2001. Gross margin increased $355.3 million due to the opening of 62 new stores in fiscal 2001 and to the inclusion of a full year of operating results for the 61 stores opened in fiscal 2000. Comparable store gross margin increased $113.9 million. The Companys gross margin as a percent of net sales was 34.3% for fiscal 2001 compared to 34.1% for fiscal 2000. In fiscal 2001, the gross margin rate increase was primarily attributable to a change in the sales mix. Womens apparel and accessories, which increased in share of the business, achieve a higher than average gross margin rate. The Companys merchandise mix is reflected in the table below: Fiscal Year 2002 2001 2000 Womens 32.6% 31.3% 30.1% Mens 19.3% 20.1% 20.8% Home 18.0% 18.5% 18.8% Childrens 13.2% 12.8% 12.7% Footwear 8.3% 8.8% 9.4% Accessories 8.6% 8.5% 8.2% Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative (S,G&A) expenses include all direct store expenses such as payroll, occupancy and store supplies and all costs associated with the Companys distribution centers, advertising and corporate functions, but exclude depreciation and amortization. The S,G&A expense as a percent of net sales decreased from 20.40% in fiscal 2001 to 19.93% in fiscal 2002. Of the 47 basis points of rate improvement, 12 basis points are due to improvement in advertising costs, 12 basis points are related to improvement in corporate expenses, 9 basis points are due to improvement in credit operations, 9 basis points are due to improvement in distribution expenses and 5 basis points are due to improvement in store operating expenses. 10 S,G&A expense as a percent of net sales decreased from 20.84% in fiscal 2000 to 20.40% in fiscal 2001. Of the 44 basis points of rate improvement, 35 basis points are due to improvement in store operating expenses, 13 basis points are related to improvement in corporate expenses, 7 basis points are due to improvement in advertising costs and 7 basis points are related to improvement in distribution expenses. This was offset by a decline in credit operations leverage of 18 basis points. Depreciation and Amortization. The total amount of depreciation and amortization increased from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 due to the addition of new stores, the remodeling of existing stores and the mix of owned versus leased stores. Depreciation and amortization remained constant as a percentage of net sales at 2.1% for fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2002. Preopening Expenses. Preopening expenses are expensed as incurred and relate to the costs incurred prior to new store openings which includes advertising, hiring, and training costs for new employees and processing and transporting initial merchandise. The following table sets forth the Companys preopening costs for each of the last three years: Year of Store Opening Preopening Expenses Fiscal Year Total Spending 2002 2001 2000 (In Thousands) 2003 $ 8,583 $ $ $ 8,583 2002 30,695 4,724 35,419 2001 25,785 5,137 30,922 2000 30,052 30,052 Total $ 39,278 $ 30,509 $ 35,189 $ 104,976 The average cost incurred to open the 75 stores in fiscal 2002 was $472,000 per store and the average cost incurred to open the 62 stores in fiscal 2001 was $499,000. The average cost per store fluctuates based on the mix of stores opened in new markets versus fill in markets. Operating Income. Operating income increased $240.4 million or 28.3% in fiscal 2002, $198.7 million or 30.5% in fiscal 2001 and $203.0 million or 45.3% in fiscal 2000 due to the factors described above. Interest Expense. Net interest expense increased $5.9 million over fiscal 2001 to $56.0 million in fiscal 2002. The increase was primarily attributable to the $300 million aggregate principal amount of non callable 6% unsecured senior debentures issued in November 2002 (see Liquidity discussion below). Net interest expense in fiscal 2001 increased $3.9 million over fiscal 2000 to $50.1 million. The increase was primarily attributable to the $300 million of non callable unsecured senior notes issued in March 2001 and the Liquid Yield Option Subordinated Notes issued in June 2000 outstanding for a full year, offset in part by an increase in interest income on short term investments. Income Taxes. The Companys effective tax rate was 37.8% in fiscal 2002, 38.0% in fiscal 2001 and 38.5% in fiscal 2000. The overall decline in the effective tax rates in fiscal 2002 was primarily due to the decrease in state income taxes, net of federal tax benefits, and elimination of non deductible amortization of goodwill. The decline in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2001 was primarily due to the decrease in state income taxes, net of federal tax benefits and non deductible goodwill amortization as a percentage of income before taxes. Inflation The Company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations during the periods presented. However, there can be no assurance that the Companys business will not be affected in the future. 11 Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys primary ongoing cash requirements are for seasonal and new store inventory purchases, the growth in credit card accounts receivable and capital expenditures in connection with expansion and remodeling programs. The Companys primary sources of funds for its business activities are cash flow from operations and short term trade credit. Short term trade credit, in the form of extended payment terms for inventory purchases or third party factor financing, represents a significant source of financing for merchandise inventories. Seasonal cash needs are met by financing secured by its proprietary accounts receivable and lines of credit available under its revolving credit facilities. The Companys working capital and inventory levels typically build throughout the fall, peaking during the holiday selling season. In addition, the Company periodically accesses the capital markets, as needed, to finance its growth. The Companys working capital increased to $1,776.1 million at February 1, 2003, from $1,584.1 million at February 2, 2002. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of short term investments, accounts receivable and inventory, offset in part by increased accounts payable and current portion of long term debt. The Companys short term investments at February 1, 2003 increased $246.6 million over the February 2, 2002 balance of $229.4 million. The increase is primarily due to proceeds realized from the sale of unsecured senior debentures on November 21, 2002. The Companys accounts receivable at February 1, 2003 increased $154.9 million over the February 2, 2002 balance. The increase is primarily due to a 31.5% increase in proprietary credit card sales offset by increased payment rates. Proprietary credit card sales as a percent of total net sales increased from 31.8% for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2002, to 34.3% for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2003. The following table summarizes information related to Kohls proprietary credit card receivables: February 1, 2003 February 2, 2002 ($ In Thousands) Gross accounts receivable $ 1,011,690 $ 853,726 Allowance for doubtful accounts $ 20,880 $ 17,780 Allowance as a % of gross accounts receivable 2.1 % 2.1 % Accounts receivable turnover (rolling 4 quarters) * 3.5 x 3.2 x * Credit card sales divided by average quarterly gross accounts receivable The Companys merchandise inventories increased $428.7 million over the February 2, 2002 balance of $1,198.3 million. The increase was primarily due to higher merchandise levels required to support existing stores and incremental new store locations. Accounts payable increased $215.9 million to $694.7 million at February 1, 2003, from the February 2, 2002 balance. Fluctuations in the level of accounts payable are primarily attributable to the timing and number of new store openings and invoice dating arrangements with vendors. The increase in the current portion of long term debt from $16.4 million at the end of fiscal 2001 to $355.5 million at the end of fiscal 2002 is primarily due to the classification as short term of $343.3 million of Liquid Yield Option Subordinated Notes (LYONs) as of February 1, 2003 (see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company has a $225 million Receivable Purchase Agreement (RPA) with Preferred Receivables Funding Corporation, certain investors and Bank One as agent, which is renewable annually, for approximately one year intervals, at the Companys request and investors option. Pursuant to the RPA, the Company periodically sells, generally with recourse, an undivided interest in the Companys private label credit card receivables. At February 1, 2003, and February 2, 2002, no receivables were sold. For financial reporting purposes, receivables sold are treated as secured borrowings. 12 Cash provided by operating activities was $669.6 million for fiscal 2002 as compared to $541.8 million for fiscal 2001, and $372.1 million for fiscal 2000. Capital expenditures include costs for new store openings, store remodels, distribution center openings and other base capital needs. The Companys capital expenditures, including favorable lease rights, were $716.0 million during fiscal 2002, $662.0 million during fiscal 2001 and $481.0 million during fiscal 2000. The increases in annual expenditures are related to the number of new stores, the timing of new store capital spending, and the mix of owned, leased or acquired stores. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2003 are currently expected to be approximately $825 million. This estimate includes new store and remodel spending as well as base capital needs. The Company plans to open approximately 80 new stores in fiscal 2003. The total cash outlay required for a newly constructed leased store is approximately $5.5 million, which includes capital expenditures, preopening expenses and net working capital. The additional cash outlay required for a newly constructed owned store will vary depending upon land and sitework costs, but is expected to be approximately $8.0 million. The Company does not anticipate that its planned expansion will be limited by any restrictive covenants in its financing agreements. In November 2002, the Company issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of non callable 6% unsecured senior debentures due January 15, 2033. Net proceeds, excluding expenses, were $297.8 million and will be used for general corporate purposes, including continued store growth. In July 2002, the Company executed two new unsecured revolving bank credit facilities. The first agreement consists of a $532 million facility maturing July 10, 2007. The second agreement consists of a $133 million facility maturing July 8, 2003 and renewable at the Companys request and at the banks option. Depending on the type of advance under the new facilities, amounts borrowed bear interest at competitive bid rates; the LIBOR plus a margin, based on the Companys long term unsecured debt rating; or the agent banks base rate. In March 2001, the Company issued $300 million aggregate principle amount of 6.30% unsecured notes due March 1, 2011. The proceeds have been used for general corporate purposes, including continued store growth. In June 2000, the Company issued $551.5 million aggregate principal amount of Liquid Yield Option Subordinated Notes (LYONs) due 2020. Net proceeds, excluding expenses, were $319.4 million. The debt is callable by the Company beginning June 12, 2003, for cash. The holders of the securities can put the LYONs back to the Company after three and ten years from the date of issuance. As the holders can put the LYONs back to the Company in 2003, such securities have been reflected as current maturities of long term debt. The Company anticipates that it will be able to satisfy its working capital requirements, planned capital expenditures, and debt service requirements with available cash and short term investments, proceeds from cash flows from operations, short term trade credit, $225 million of available financing secured by its proprietary credit card accounts receivable, seasonal borrowings under its $665 million revolving credit facilities and other sources of financing. The Company expects to generate adequate cash flows from operating activities to sustain current levels of operations. The Company maintains favorable banking relations and anticipates that the necessary credit agreements will be extended or new agreements will be entered into in order to provide future borrowing requirements as needed. 13 Contractual Obligations The Company has aggregate contractual obligations of $5,711.2 million related to debt repayments, capital leases and operating leases as follows: Fiscal Year 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter Total (In Thousands) Long term debt $ 353,402 $ 10,135 $ 138 $ 100,416 $ 373 $ 895,291 $ 1,359,755 Capital leases (a) 2,062 2,014 2,181 2,422 2,729 43,085 54,493 Operating leases 232,419 255,511 251,258 242,751 242,626 3,072,389 4,296,954 Total $ 587,883 $ 267,660 $ 253,577 $ 345,589 $ 245,728 $ 4,010,765 $ 5,711,202 (a) Annual commitments on capital leases are net of interest The Company also has outstanding letters of credit and stand by letters of credit that total approximately $20.4 million and $2.0 million, respectively, at February 1, 2003. If certain conditions were met under these arrangements, the Company would be required to satisfy the obligations in cash. Due to the nature of these arrangements and based on historical experience, the Company does not expect to make any significant payments. Therefore, they have been excluded from the preceding table. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors, namely aging and historical trends. Delinquent accounts are written off automatically after the passage of 180 days without receiving a full scheduled monthly payment. Accounts are written off sooner in the event of customer bankruptcy or other circumstances that make further collection unlikely. For all other accounts, the Company recognizes reserves for bad debts based on the length of time the accounts are past due and the anticipated future write offs based on historical experience. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $20.9 million or 2.1% of gross receivables at February 1, 2003, $17.8 million or 2.1% of gross receivables at February 2, 2002 and $9.3 million or 1.3% of gross receivables at February 3, 2001. The components of the allowance for doubtful accounts are as follows: Fiscal Year Ended February 1, 2003 February 2, 2002 February 3, 2001 (In Thousands) Accounts Receivable Allowances: Balance at Beginning of Year $ 17,780 $ 9,282 $ 7,171 Charged to Costs and Expenses 43,739 41,284 22,677 Deductions Bad Debts Written off, Net of Recoveries and Other Allowances (40,639 ) (32,786 ) (20,566 ) Balance at End of Year $ 20,880 $ 17,780 $ 9,282 Retail Inventory Method and Inventory Valuation The Company values its inventory at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on the last in, first out (LIFO) basis using the retail inventory method (RIM). Under RIM, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail value inventories. RIM is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality. The use of the retail inventory method will result in inventories being valued at the lower of cost or market as markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories. 14 Based on a review of historical clearance markdowns, current business trends and discontinued merchandise categories, an adjustment to inventory is recorded to reflect additional markdowns which are estimated to be necessary to liquidate existing clearance inventories and reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market. Management believes that the Companys inventory valuation approximates the net realizable value of clearance inventory and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market. Vendor Allowances The Company records vendor allowances and discounts in the income statement when the purpose for which those monies were designated is fulfilled. Allowances provided by vendors generally relate to profitability of inventory recently sold and, accordingly, are reflected as reductions to cost of merchandise sold as negotiated. Vendor allowances received for advertising or fixture programs reduce the Companys expense or expenditure for the related advertising or fixture program. Reserve Estimates The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation, general liability and employee related health care benefits, a portion of which is paid by its associates. The Company determines the estimates for the liabilities associated with these risks by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from the current assumptions and historical trends. Under its workers compensation and general liability insurance policies, the Company retains the initial risk of $500,000 and $250,000, respectively, per occurrence. Capital versus Operating Leases The Company evaluates all lease agreements in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases, to determine whether a lease is operating or capital. The Company reviews the fair market value as well as the useful life of the related assets. Both of these assumptions are subject to estimation. The senior management of the Company has discussed the development and selection of the above critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the Companys board of directors. New Accounting Pronouncements The FASB issued SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections, in April 2002. This statement addresses the determination as to whether a transaction should be reported as an extraordinary item or reported in normal earnings. The adoption of this statement did not have an impact on the Companys results of operations or financial position presented in this report. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, effective for disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized, at fair value, when the liability is incurred rather than at the time an entity commits to a plan. The Company did not incur any new liability related to a disposal cost or exit activity between adoption of this statement on January 1, 2003, and the end of the fiscal year on February 1, 2003. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 146 to have a significant impact on its results of operations or financial position. 15 The Emerging Issues Task Force released Issue No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor in November 2002, applicable to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2002. The Company records vendor allowances and discounts in the income statement when the purpose for which those monies were designated is fulfilled. As such, the Company does not expect the release to have a significant effect on its results of operations or financial position. Forward Looking Information/Risk Factors Items 1, 3, 5 and 7 of this Form 10 K contain forward looking statements, subject to protections under federal law. The Company intends words such as believes, anticipates, plans, may, will, should, expects and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements. In addition, statements covering the Companys future sales or financial performance and the Companys plans, objectives, expectations or intentions are forward looking statements, such as statements regarding the Companys liquidity, debt service requirements, planned capital expenditures, future store openings and adequacy of capital resources and reserves. There are a number of important factors that could cause the Companys results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward looking statements, including among others, those risk factors described in Exhibit 99.1 attached to this 10 K and incorporated herein by this reference. Forward looking statements relate to the date made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update them. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Companys primary exposure to market risk consists of changes in interest rates or borrowings. At February 1, 2003, the Companys long term debt, excluding capital leases, was $1,359.8 million, all of which is fixed rate debt. Long term fixed rate debt is utilized as a primary source of capital. When these debt instruments mature, the Company may refinance such debt at then existing market interest rates, which may be more or less than interest rates on the maturing debt. If interest rates on the existing fixed rate debt outstanding at February 1, 2003, changed by 100 basis points, the Companys annual interest expense would change by $13.6 million. During fiscal 2002, average borrowings under the Companys variable rate revolving credit facilities and its short term financing of its proprietary accounts receivable were $47.4 million. If interest rates on the average fiscal 2002 variable rate debt changed by 100 basis points, the Companys annual interest expense would change by $474,000, assuming comparable borrowing levels.
