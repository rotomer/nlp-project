Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary Kohls mission is to be the leading family focused, value oriented, specialty department store offering national brand merchandise to the customer in an environment that is clean, friendly and convenient. Kohls operates from coast to coast, having grown from 76 stores in six states at the time of its Initial Public Offering (IPO) in 1992 to 542 stores in 36 states at January 31, 2004. In fiscal 2003, the Company entered the greater Los Angeles area, which moved the Company from a regional to a national retailer. Kohls concentrates on profitable expansion. The Company increased its square footage by 20% in fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2004, the Company plans to open approximately 95 new stores, increasing square footage by approximately 18.5%. The Companys disciplined approach to new store selection ensures that new store locations achieve an appropriate return on investment. The Companys future growth plans are to increase its presence in all of the regions it currently serves and to expand into new markets. Sales projections are built with the expectations of generating 70% 80% of the sales volume of an average store in new stores as well as achieving comparable store sales increases in existing stores. In order to increase sales productivity in existing stores, the Company strives to add freshness in its assortments through the addition of new brands and extension of existing brands into new classifications. The Company also continues to invest in updating its stores with a goal of remodeling stores approximately every 7 8 years. Kohls revenues are generated through its sales in existing stores and through sales from new stores opened as a result of its expansion program. In fiscal 2003, net sales crossed the $10 billion milestone. Kohls utilizes extensive marketing to drive traffic to the stores. The Company reaches its customers through newspaper inserts, direct mail, radio and television. The Companys marketing strategies continue to evolve as it seeks new and creative ways to reach its customers. The Company has historically operated with a gross margin rate of approximately 34% of net sales. This was not achieved in fiscal 2003 as the Companys gross margin rate declined to 33.0% primarily due to markdowns taken in womens apparel. In 2004, the Company expects to return to its historical rate. Critical to the Companys successful growth is the infrastructure that has been developed and refined since becoming a public company in 1992. As a result of its sales performance, the Company has historically been able to leverage its Selling, General and Administrative (S,G&A) expenses from year to year. In fiscal 2003, the Companys S,G&A expenses increased 15.0% over fiscal 2002, less than the store growth of 18.6%, but did not leverage these expenses due to a comparable store sales decline of 1.6%. Looking forward, the Company would expect to leverage S,G&A expenses with a low single digit comparable store sales increase. The retail industry is highly competitive and fiscal 2003 was no exception. In addition, the retail business is influenced by seasonality, especially those retailers that are focused primarily on sales of apparel. Fiscal 2003 was especially challenging for Kohls and the Company was clearly disappointed with its sales and earnings performance for the year. After a thorough review and analysis of the results, the Company determined that it did not execute to its normally high standards in three key areas: Inventory levels and content The customer shopping experience Marketing The Company has made adjustments to address these issues in fiscal 2004. The Company has reduced its inventory levels appropriately and made modifications to its merchandise assortments. Shopping will be easier 9 for the Kohls customer with the lower inventory levels. Changes have also been made to the Companys advertising vehicles to make them more unique in a highly promotional retail environment. The Companys goal is to increase net income at least 20% annually through a combination of new store growth and comparable store sales growth, maintenance of historical gross margin levels and through modest S,G&A leverage on the increasing sales base. The Companys capital structure is well positioned to continue to support its expansion plans. Internally generated cash flows will continue to be the primary source of the funding required for future growth. In addition, the Company has maintained its long term debt ratings of A3 by Moodys and A by Standard & Poors. The discussion and analysis below further explains the Company results and operations for fiscal 2003. Results of Operations The Companys net income was $591.2 million in fiscal 2003 compared to $643.4 million in fiscal 2002, a decrease of $52.2 million or 8.1%. Net income increased $147.7 million or 29.8% in fiscal 2002 and $123.6 million, or 33.2%, in fiscal 2001. Components of Earnings. The following table sets forth statement of operations data as a percentage of net sales for each of the last three fiscal years: Fiscal Year 2003 2002 2001 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of merchandise sold 67.0 65.6 65.7 Gross margin 33.0 34.4 34.3 Selling, general and administrative expenses 20.3 19.9 20.4 Depreciation and amortization 2.3 2.1 2.1 Preopening expenses 0.4 0.4 0.4 Operating income 10.0 12.0 11.4 Interest expense, net 0.8 0.6 0.7 Income before income taxes 9.2 11.4 10.7 Provision for income taxes 3.5 4.3 4.1 Net income 5.7 % 7.1 % 6.6 % Net Sales. Net sales, number of stores, sales growth and net sales per selling square foot by year for the last three fiscal years were as follows: Fiscal Year 2003 2002 2001 Net sales (in thousands) $ 10,282,094 $ 9,120,287 $ 7,488,654 Number of stores open (end of period) 542 457 382 Sales growth all stores 12.7 % 21.8 % 21.7 % Sales growth comparable stores (a) (1.6 %) 5.3 % 6.8 % Net sales per selling square foot (b) $ 268 $ 284 $ 283 Comparable store base 382 320 259 (a) Comparable store sales growth for each period is based on sales of stores (including relocated or expanded stores) open throughout the full period and throughout the full prior fiscal year. Fiscal 2002 comparable sales growth compares the 52 weeks of fiscal 2002 to the 52 weeks of fiscal 2001. Fiscal 2001 comparable sales growth was calculated based on the 52 weeks of fiscal 2001 versus the 52 weeks ended January 27, 2001. (b) Net sales per selling square foot is calculated using net sales of stores that have been open for the full year divided by their square footage of selling space. 10 Net sales increased $1,161.8 million, or 12.7%, from $9,120.3 million in fiscal 2002 to $10,282.1 million in fiscal 2003. Net sales increased $1,294.2 million due to the opening of 85 new stores in fiscal 2003 and to the inclusion of a full year of operating results for the 75 stores opened in fiscal 2002. Comparable store sales decreased $132.4 million, or 1.6%, in fiscal 2003. The number of transactions in comparable stores increased 1.2% while the average transaction value declined 2.8%. The Childrens business had the strongest sales performance with flat comparable store sales, while the Womens business was the most difficult, declining approximately 3.0% on a comparable store basis. Both businesses achieved an increase of approximately 9.0% a year ago. The Northeast and South Central regions had the strongest comparable store sales performance with a low single digit percent increase on top of high single digit percent increases a year ago. The Midwest region was the most difficult, with comparable store sales declining 3.5% against a comparable store sales increase of approximately 3.0% in fiscal 2002. Net sales increased $1,631.6 million, or 21.8%, from $7,488.7 million in fiscal 2001 to $9,120.3 million in fiscal 2002. Net sales increased $1,275.9 million due to the opening of 75 new stores in fiscal 2002 and to the inclusion of a full year of sales for the 62 stores opened in fiscal 2001. Comparable store sales increased $355.7 million or 5.3% in fiscal 2002. Gross Margin. Gross margin increased $256.0 million from $3,139.1 million in fiscal 2002 to $3,395.1 million in fiscal 2003. Gross margin increased $389.8 million due to the opening of 85 new stores in fiscal 2003 and to the inclusion of a full year of operating results for the 75 stores opened in fiscal 2002. Comparable store gross margin decreased $133.8 million due to increased markdowns. The Companys gross margin as a percent of net sales was 33.0% for fiscal 2003 compared to 34.4% for fiscal 2002. The largest contributor to the gross margin rate decline was Womens apparel. Gross margin increased $574.0 million from $2,565.1 million in fiscal 2001 to $3,139.1 million in fiscal 2002. Gross margin increased $419.2 million due to the opening of 75 new stores in fiscal 2002 and to the inclusion of a full year of operating results for the 62 stores opened in fiscal 2001. Comparable store gross margin increased $154.8 million. The Companys gross margin as a percent of net sales was 34.4% for fiscal 2002 compared to 34.3% for fiscal 2001. The increase in gross margin rate is attributable to improved gross margin rates in most merchandise categories and a favorable change in the sales mix. The Companys merchandise mix is reflected in the table below: Fiscal Year 2003 2002 2001 Womens 32.1 % 32.6 % 31.3 % Mens 19.0 % 19.3 % 20.1 % Home 18.4 % 18.0 % 18.5 % Childrens 13.5 % 13.2 % 12.8 % Accessories 8.7 % 8.6 % 8.5 % Footwear 8.3 % 8.3 % 8.8 % Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. S,G&A expenses include all direct store expenses such as payroll, occupancy and store supplies and all costs associated with the Companys distribution centers, advertising and corporate functions, but exclude depreciation and amortization. S,G&A expenses increased $273.4 million, or 15.0%, to $2,091.4 million in fiscal 2003 compared to $1,818.0 million in fiscal 2002. S,G&A expenses as a percent of net sales increased from 19.9% in fiscal 2002 to 20.3% in fiscal 2003, an increase of 41 basis points. Store operating expenses increased 19.4%, which is consistent with the Companys square footage growth. Store operating expenses increased 75 basis points in fiscal 2003. Advertising expenses increased 18 basis points primarily due to an increase in television and magazine advertising. These increases were offset by a 19 basis point reduction in distribution expenses attributable to increased productivity on a units per hour basis at the distribution centers, a 13 basis point improvement in credit operations and a 20 basis point improvement in corporate expenses. 11 S,G&A expenses increased $290.5 million, or 19.0%, to $1,818.0 million in fiscal 2002 compared to $1,527.5 million in fiscal 2001. S,G&A expenses as a percent of net sales decreased from 20.4% in fiscal 2001 to 19.9% in fiscal 2002. The 47 basis point rate improvement consisted of a 12 basis point improvement in corporate expenses, a 12 basis point improvement in advertising costs, a 9 basis point improvement in distribution expenses, a 9 basis point improvement in credit operations and a 5 basis point improvement in store operating expenses. Depreciation and Amortization. The total amount of depreciation and amortization increased from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003 due to the addition of new stores, the remodeling of existing stores and the mix of owned versus leased stores. Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales was 2.3% for fiscal 2003 and 2.1% for fiscal 2002. Preopening Expenses. Preopening expenses are expensed as incurred and relate to the costs incurred prior to new store openings which includes advertising, hiring, and training costs for new employees and processing and transporting initial merchandise. The average cost per store fluctuates based on the mix of stores opened in new markets versus fill in markets, with new markets being more expensive. The average cost to open the 85 new stores in fiscal 2003 was $550,000, the average cost to open the 75 new stores in fiscal 2002 was $470,000 and the average cost to open the 62 new stores in fiscal 2001 was $500,000. The increase in the average cost to open a store in fiscal 2003 was due to a higher mix of new market stores. Interest Expense. Net interest expense increased $16.9 million from $56.0 million in fiscal 2002 to $72.9 million in fiscal 2003. Of the increase, $6.1 million is attributed to the write off of deferred financing fees related to the redemption of the Companys Liquid Yield Option Subordinated Notes (LYONs) in the second quarter of 2003. The remaining increase is primarily attributable to the $300 million aggregate principal amount of non callable 6% unsecured senior debentures issued in November 2002 partially offset by the redemption of the 2.75% LYONs during the second quarter of 2003. Net interest expense in fiscal 2002 increased $5.9 million from $50.1 million in fiscal 2001 to $56.0 million. The increase was primarily attributable to the $300 million aggregate principal amount of non callable 6% unsecured senior debentures issued in November 2002. Income Taxes. The Companys effective tax rate was 37.8% in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 and 38.0% in fiscal 2001. The overall decline in the effective tax rates from fiscal 2001 was primarily due to the decrease in state income taxes, net of federal tax benefits, and elimination of non deductible amortization of goodwill. Inflation The Company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations during the periods presented. However, there can be no assurance that the Companys business will not be affected by inflation in the future. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys primary ongoing cash requirements are for capital expenditures in connection with the expansion and remodeling programs, seasonal and new store inventory purchases, and the growth in credit card accounts receivable. The Companys primary sources of funds for its business activities are cash flow from operations and short term trade credit. Operating Activities. Cash flow provided by operations was $754.5 million in fiscal 2003 compared to $669.6 million in fiscal 2002, an $84.9 million increase. The primary source of cash flow provided by operations was net income before depreciation and amortization. The primary uses of cash flow were $831.6 million of capital expenditures (see discussion below), a $159.3 million growth in Kohls accounts receivable portfolio and a $118.1 million decrease in accounts payable as discussed below. Short term trade credit, in the form of extended payment terms for inventory purchases, represents a significant source of financing for merchandise 12 inventories. Seasonal cash needs are met by financing secured by its proprietary accounts receivable and lines of credit available under its revolving credit facilities. The Companys working capital and inventory levels typically build throughout the fall, peaking during the holiday selling season. Key financial ratios that provide certain measures of the Companys liquidity are as follows: January 31,2004 February 1,2003 February 2,2002 Working capital $ 1,902,482 $ 1,776,102 $ 1,584,073 Current ratio 2.70 2.18 2.80 Debt/capital 20.6 % 28.7 % 28.5 % The improvement in the Companys current ratio and debt / capital percentage was due to the redemption of the Companys LYONs for $346.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2003. The Companys accounts receivable at January 31, 2004 increased $159.3 million over the February 1, 2003 balance. The increase is primarily due to a 18.4% increase in proprietary credit card sales offset by increased payment rates. Write offs decreased to 1.1% of Kohls charge sales in fiscal 2003 from 1.3% in fiscal 2002. As a result, the allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced to 1.9% of gross accounts receivable in fiscal 2003 from 2.1% in fiscal 2002. The Companys credit card program supports earnings growth by driving sales through promotional events and through the growth in the proprietary credit card financial performance. The following table summarizes information related to Kohls proprietary credit card receivables: January 31, 2004 February 1, 2003 February 2, 2002 ($ In Thousands) Gross accounts receivable $ 1,172,678 $ 1,011,690 $ 853,726 Allowance for doubtful accounts $ 22,521 $ 20,880 $ 17,780 Allowance as a % of gross accounts receivable 1.9 % 2.1 % 2.1 % Accounts receivable turnover (rolling 4 quarters)* 3.6 x 3.5 x 3.2 x Proprietary credit card share 36.0 % 34.3 % 31.8 % Pre tax credit card contribution $ 84,644 $ 67,412 $ 48,593 * Credit card sales divided by average quarterly gross accounts receivable At January 31, 2004, the Companys merchandise inventories decreased $20.0 million, a decrease of 1.2% from the February 1, 2003, balance of $1,627.0 million. On an average store basis, the inventory at January 31, 2004, was down approximately 17% and the number of units per store declined approximately 12% from February 1, 2003. Accounts payable decreased $118.1 million to $532.6 million at January 31, 2004, from the February 1, 2003, balance primarily due to the timing of new store and spring receipts. Investing Activities. Capital expenditures include costs for new store openings, store remodels, distribution center openings and other base capital needs. The Companys capital expenditures, including favorable lease rights, were $831.6 million during fiscal 2003, $716.0 million during fiscal 2002 and $662.0 million during fiscal 2001. The Company opened 85 new stores and remodeled 25 stores in fiscal 2003 increasing total square footage by approximately 20%, which is consistent with managements expansion strategy. In addition, the Company continued to make capital investments for information systems, distribution capacity and other infrastructure to support the Companys growth. The Company plans to open approximately 95 new stores in fiscal 2004, which represents approximately a 18.5% growth in total square footage. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2004 are currently expected to be approximately $1.0 billion. Capital expenditures include costs for new store openings, store remodels, the construction of a distribution center in Atlanta, GA, the expansion of the corporate office and other base capital needs. The amount of capital expenditures fluctuate as a result of the timing of new store capital spending, the 13 mix of owned, leased and acquired stores, the number of stores remodeled and the timing of opening distribution centers. The Company does not anticipate that its planned expansion will be limited by any restrictive covenants in its financing agreements. The Companys capital structure is well positioned to support its expansion plans. The Company anticipates that internally generated cash flows will be the primary source of funding for future growth. Financing Activities. The Company anticipates that it will be able to satisfy its working capital requirements, planned capital expenditures and debt service requirements with available cash and short term investments, proceeds from cash flows from operations, short term trade credit, financing secured by its proprietary credit card accounts receivable, seasonal borrowings under its revolving credit facilities and other sources of financing. The Company expects to generate adequate cash flows from operating activities to sustain current levels of operations. The Company maintains favorable banking relationships and anticipates that the necessary credit agreements will be extended or new agreements will be entered into in order to provide future borrowing requirements as needed. As of March 18, 2004, the Company maintains strong credit ratings as follows: Credit Ratings Moodys Standard& Poors Long term debt A3 A The Company has a $225 million Receivable Purchase Agreement (RPA) with Preferred Receivables Funding Corporation, a certain investor and Bank One as agent, which is renewable annually, at the Companys request and the investors option. Pursuant to the RPA, the Company periodically sells, generally with recourse, an undivided interest in the Companys private label credit card receivables. At January 31, 2004, and February 1, 2003, no receivables were sold. For financial reporting purposes, receivables sold are treated as secured borrowings. In November 2002, the Company issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of non callable 6% unsecured senior debentures due January 15, 2033. Net proceeds, excluding expenses, were $297.8 million and have been used for general corporate purposes, including continued store growth. In July 2002, the Company executed two unsecured revolving bank credit facilities. The first is a $532 million facility maturing July 10, 2007. The second is a $133 million facility originally scheduled to mature on July 8, 2003. This second facility is renewable at the Companys request and at the banks option, and on June 30, 2003 the term was extended to mature on July 8, 2004. Depending on the type of advance under these facilities, amounts borrowed bear interest at competitive bid rates; the LIBOR plus a margin, based on the Companys long term unsecured debt rating; or the agent banks base rate. In June 2000, the Company issued $551.5 million aggregate principal amount of LYONs due 2020. Net proceeds, excluding expenses, were $319.4 million. On June 13, 2003, the holders of approximately 99.5% of the Companys outstanding LYONs due 2020 exercised their options to redeem their notes, in accordance with the terms of the LYONs. The remaining LYONs were called by the Company on August 1, 2003. The Company elected to redeem all of these notes for cash. The total amount payable by the Company for the LYONs redeemed was $346.6 million, which was paid with available funds. In conjunction with the redemption, the Company wrote off the remaining deferred financing costs related to the LYONs during the second quarter of 2003. The write off of $6.1 million is included in interest expense for fiscal 2003. The decrease in the current portion of long term debt from $355.5 million at the end of fiscal 2002 to $12.5 million at the end of fiscal 2003 is primarily due to the redemption of the LYONs in August 2003 (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 14 Outlook In looking at fiscal 2004, the Companys preliminary earnings guidance is based upon a low single digit comparable store sales increase. With the adjustments the Company is making to the inventory levels and content, the Company would expect that the gross margin rate would return to historical levels of approximately 34% of net sales. As a result, fiscal 2004 net income should grow approximately 25% to 30% over fiscal 2003 with earnings in the range of $2.13 to $2.21 per diluted share. Contractual Obligations The Company has aggregate contractual obligations of $5,969.5 million related to debt repayments, capital leases and operating leases as follows: Fiscal Year 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total (In Thousands) Long term debt $ 10,138 $ 138 $ 100,416 $ 369 $ 329 $ 895,176 $ 1,006,566 Capital leases (a) 2,391 2,516 2,767 3,130 3,718 67,414 81,936 Operating leases 286,452 298,028 291,801 283,468 281,114 3,440,169 4,881,032 Total $ 298,981 $ 300,682 $ 394,984 $ 286,967 $ 285,161 $ 4,402,759 $ 5,969,534 (a) Annual commitments on capital leases are net of interest. The Company has entered into future capital lease commitments for land and buildings that total approximately $22.7 million at January 31, 2004, which have not been recorded as the related buildings are under construction. The Company also has outstanding letters of credit and stand by letters of credit that total approximately $52.0 million at January 31, 2004. If certain conditions were met under these arrangements, the Company would be required to satisfy the obligations in cash. Due to the nature of these arrangements and based on historical experience, the Company does not expect to make any significant payments. Therefore, they have been excluded from the preceding table. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has not provided any financial guarantees as of January 31, 2004. All purchase obligations are cancelable and therefore are not included in the above table. The Company has not created, and is not party to, any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating the Companys business. The Company does not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect the Companys liquidity or the availability of capital resources. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. A discussion of the more significant estimates follows. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts as an estimate of the accounts receivable balance that may not be collected. The Company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on the aging of 15 accounts, historical write off experience and specific review for potential bad debts. Delinquent accounts are written off automatically after the passage of 180 days without receiving a full scheduled monthly payment. Accounts are written off sooner in the event of customer bankruptcy or other circumstances that make further collection unlikely. For all other accounts, the Company recognizes reserves for bad debts based on the length of time the accounts are past due and the anticipated future write offs based on historical experience. Factors that would cause this allowance to increase primarily relate to increased customer bankruptcies or other difficulties that make further collection unlikely. Conversely, improved write off experience and aging of receivables would result in a decrease in the provision. Retail Inventory Method and Inventory Valuation The Company values its inventory at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on the last in, first out (LIFO) basis using the retail inventory method (RIM). Under RIM, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail value inventories. RIM is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality. The use of the retail inventory method will result in inventories being valued at the lower of cost or market as markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories. Based on a review of historical clearance markdowns, current business trends, expected vendor funding and discontinued merchandise categories, an adjustment to inventory is recorded to reflect additional markdowns which are estimated to be necessary to liquidate existing clearance inventories and reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market. Management believes that the Companys inventory valuation approximates the net realizable value of clearance inventory and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market. Vendor Allowances The Company records vendor allowances and discounts in the income statement when the purpose for which those monies were designated is fulfilled. Allowances provided by vendors generally relate to profitability of inventory recently sold and, accordingly, are reflected as reductions to cost of merchandise sold as negotiated. Vendor allowances received for advertising or fixture programs reduce the Companys expense or expenditure for the related advertising or fixture program. Vendor participation in the selling of merchandise will fluctuate based on the amount of promotional and clearance markdowns necessary to liquidate the inventory. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Business and Summary of Accounting Policies for fiscal 2004 changes. Insurance Reserve Estimates The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation, general liability and employee related health care benefits, a portion of which is paid by its associates. The Company determines the estimates for the liabilities associated with these risks by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. A change in claims frequency and severity of claims from historical experience as well as changes in state statutes and the mix of states in which the Company operates could result in a change to the required reserve levels. Under its workers compensation and general liability insurance policies, the Company retains the initial risk of $500,000 and $250,000, respectively, per occurrence. Impairment of Assets and Closed Store Reserves The Company has a significant investment in property and equipment and favorable lease rights. The related depreciation and amortization is computed using estimated useful lives of up to 50 years. The Company reviews long lived assets held for use (including favorable lease rights) for impairment annually or whenever an event, 16 such as decisions to close a store, indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The Company has historically not experienced any significant impairment of long lived assets or closed store reserves. Decisions to close a store can also result in accelerated depreciation over the revised useful life. If the store is leased, a reserve is set up for the discounted difference between the rent and the expected sublease rental income when the location is no longer in use. A significant change in cash flows, market valuation, demand for real estate or other factors, could result in an increase or decrease in the reserve requirement or impairment charge. Income Taxes The Company pays income taxes based on tax statutes, regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which it operates. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various taxing authorities. The Companys effective income tax rate was 37.8% in 2003 and 2002 and was 38.0% in 2001. The effective rate is impacted by changes in law, location of new stores, level of earnings and the result of tax audits. New Accounting Pronouncements In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities an interpretation of ARB No. 51 (FIN No. 46), which has been subsequently deferred and revised by the FASB on several dates. This interpretation addresses consolidation and reporting by business enterprises of variable interest entities (VIEs). VIEs are entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights. FIN No. 46, as revised, provides for various effective dates for adoption of the interpretations provisions depending upon the date of creation of the VIEs and their nature. FIN No. 46 has not had, and is not expected to have, any effect on the Companys consolidated financial position or the results of operations. In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) released No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor applicable to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2002 and is effective for contracts entered into after December 31, 2002. The adoption of EITF 02 16 did not have a material impact on net earnings in fiscal year 2003, as the Company entered into substantially all of its fiscal 2003 vendor contracts prior to December 31, 2002. Because substantially all new vendor contracts for new store advertising have been put in place for fiscal 2004, the Company will adopt the provisions of EITF 02 16 and account for these allowances as a reduction of inventory and cost of merchandise sold. This change in accounting will reduce fiscal year 2004 diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.01 $0.02 per diluted share with the majority of the impact on net earnings occurring during the first and third quarters of fiscal 2004 in conjunction with the Companys new store openings and build in inventory. This change in accounting will not impact the Companys cash flow or the expected amount of contributions to be received from the Companys vendors. The FASB is currently reviewing the rules governing stock option accounting and has made a tentative decision to require expense recognition of stock options in the income statement. The FASB intends to develop revised rules that would be effective for fiscal 2005. The Company will adopt any new rules required by the FASB when they are effective. The pro forma impact of expensing unvested stock options on fiscal 2003 earnings is disclosed in Note 1 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Forward Looking Information/Risk Factors Items 1, 3, 5, 7 and 7A of this Form 10 K contain forward looking statements, subject to protections under federal law. The Company intends words such as believes, anticipates, plans, may, will, should, expects and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements. In addition, statements covering the Companys future sales or financial performance and the Companys plans, performance and other objectives, expectations or intentions are forward looking statements, such as statements regarding the Companys liquidity, debt service requirements, planned capital expenditures, future store openings and 17 adequacy of capital resources and reserves. There are a number of important factors that could cause the Companys results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward looking statements, including among others, those risk factors described in Exhibit 99.1 attached to this Form 10 K and incorporated herein by this reference. Forward looking statements relate to the date made, and the Company undertakes no obligations to update them. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Companys primary exposure to market risk consists of changes in interest rates or borrowings. At January 31, 2004, the Companys long term debt, excluding capital leases, was $1,006.6 million, all of which is fixed rate debt. Long term fixed rate debt is utilized as a primary source of capital. When these debt instruments mature, the Company may refinance such debt at then existing market interest rates, which may be more or less than interest rates on the maturing debt. If interest rates on the existing fixed rate debt outstanding at January 31, 2004, changed by 100 basis points, the Companys annual interest expense would change by $10.1 million. During fiscal 2003, average borrowings under the Companys variable rate revolving credit facilities and its short term financing of its proprietary accounts receivable were $79.7 million. If interest rates on the average fiscal 2003 variable rate debt changed by 100 basis points, the Companys annual interest expense would change by $797,000, assuming comparable borrowing levels. During fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002, the Company did not enter into any derivative financial instruments.
