Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary Kohls mission is to be the leading family focused, value oriented, specialty department store offering quality, exclusive and national brand merchandise to the customer in an environment that is convenient, friendly and exciting. Kohls operates from coast to coast, having grown from 76 stores in six states at the time of its initial public offering (IPO) in 1992 to 637 stores in 40 states at January 29, 2005. In fiscal 2004, the Company continued its expansion into the Southwest region with entries into San Francisco, Sacramento and San Diego. Kohls concentrates on profitable expansion. The Company increased its square footage by 18.7% in fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2005, the Company plans to open approximately 95 new stores, including its entry into Florida with stores opening in Orlando and Jacksonville, increasing square footage by approximately 15%. The Companys disciplined approach to new store selection ensures that new store locations achieve an appropriate return on investment. The Companys capital structure is well positioned to continue to support its expansion plans. Internally generated cash flows will continue to be the primary source of the funding required for future growth. In addition, the Company has maintained its long term debt ratings of A3 by Moodys, A by Standard & Poors and A by Fitch. The Companys future growth plans are to increase its presence in all of the regions it currently serves and to expand into new markets. The Companys revenues are generated through sales from existing stores and through sales from new stores opened as a result of its expansion program. Sales projections are built with the expectations of generating 70% 80% of the sales volume of an average store in new stores in their first full year of operations as well as achieving comparable store sales increases in existing stores. In order to increase sales productivity in existing stores and attract new customers, the Company strives to add freshness in its assortments through the addition of new brands and extension of existing brands into new classifications. The Company also continues to invest in updating its stores with a goal of remodeling stores approximately every 8 9 years. Critical to the Companys successful growth is the infrastructure that has been developed and refined since becoming a public company in 1992. Over the past five years, sales have grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21% and net income has grown at a CAGR of 23%. This growth was achieved through a combination of comparable store sales increases, square footage growth, gross margin expansion and selling, general and administrative (S,G&A) leverage. In fiscal 2004, the Company earned $730.4 million in net income, an increase of 25.7%, with a sales increase of 13.8% over fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2004, the Company achieved the highest gross margin rate in its history. The Companys S,G&A expenses increased 20.8% over fiscal 2003 which was in line with the Companys square footage growth of 18.7%. Store expenses and advertising expenses did not leverage for the fiscal year due to the flat comparable store sales. The credit, corporate and distribution functional areas did leverage in fiscal 2004. Looking forward, the Company expects to leverage S,G&A expenses with an approximately 3% comparable store sales increase in fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2004 was a solid year from an earnings and operational perspective. The Companys net sales increased 13.8% while comparable store sales were up 0.3%. The goal for 2005 is to return to the mid single digit comparable store sales increases achieved in the past. In order to achieve this goal, the Company will continue to focus on the four initiatives it introduced in fiscal 2004: Merchandise content Inventory management In store shopping experience Differentiation in marketing The Company progressed on these initiatives in fiscal 2004. The merchandise content was improved by adding new national, exclusive and private brands. The Company reduced its overall inventory levels and 9 increased its effectiveness of being in stock by flowing goods more frequently and closer to the time of sale. Ease of shopping for the Companys customer improved with the lower inventory levels and the focus on providing wide aisles throughout the store. The Company made innovative marketing enhancements that motivated the customer to shop at Kohls. In 2005, the Company is focused on attracting new customers and increasing the shopping frequency of its existing customers. In order to achieve this goal, the Company has developed a fully integrated marketing approach using circulars, direct mail, radio, magazines, internet and, especially, television to brand Kohls. The Companys marketing strategies will continue to evolve as it seeks new and exciting ways to reach its customers. The Company has developed a new positioning statement, expect great things, which is a commitment to its customers, associates, business partners and shareholders. The Companys goal remains to increase net income approximately 20% annually through a combination of new store and comparable store sales growth, maintenance of the gross margin rate, and modest S,G&A leverage on the increasing sales base. Restatement of Financial Statements Following a review of the Companys lease accounting practices in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company corrected its method of accounting for leases related to stores that are located on leased land as well as for certain stores with operating leases. To reflect this correction, the Company restated its consolidated financial statements beginning with fiscal 1998. Historically, when accounting for leases with renewal options, the Company recorded rent expense on a straight line basis over the initial non cancelable lease term, with the term commencing when actual rent payments began. Depreciation of the buildings, leasehold improvements and other long lived assets on those properties occurred over a period that may have included both the initial non cancelable lease and the option periods provided for in the lease. Kohls previously believed that their audited financial statements, which reflected longstanding lease accounting treatments, were appropriate under generally accepted accounting principles. The Company revised its accounting to recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term, including cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty. This accounting adjustment resulted in the Company using a time period for its straight line rent expense calculation that equals or exceeds the time period used for depreciation. In addition, the commencement date of the lease term will be the earlier of the date when the Company becomes legally obligated for the rent payments or the date when the Company takes possession of the building for initial setup of fixtures and merchandise. These adjustments are further discussed in Note 2, Restatement of Financial Statements, to the consolidated financial statements. The correction of this accounting requires the Company to record additional deferred rent in Other long term liabilities and to adjust Deferred income taxes and Retained earnings on the consolidated balance sheets, as well as to correct rent expense included in S,G&A expense, depreciation expense and preopening expense, and the resulting effect on the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of income. The cumulative effect of these accounting changes is a reduction of retained earnings of $24.7 million as of the beginning of fiscal 2002 and decreases to retained earnings of $7.9 million and $10.3 million for the fiscal years ended 2002 and 2003, respectively. See Note 2, Restatement of Financial Statements to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the effects of these changes on the Companys consolidated balance sheets as of January 31, 2004, as well as on the Companys consolidated statements of income and cash flows for fiscal years 2003 and 2002. The accompanying Managements Discussion and Analysis gives effect to these corrections. The discussion and analysis below further explains the Companys results of operations for fiscal 2004. 10 Results of Operations The Companys net income was $730.4 million in fiscal 2004 compared to $580.9 million in fiscal 2003, an increase of $149.5 million or 25.7%. Fiscal 2003 net income decreased 8.6% over fiscal 2002 net income of $635.5 million. Fiscal 2002 net income increased 30.1% over fiscal 2001 net income of $488.5 million. Components of net income. The following table sets forth statement of operations data as a percentage of net sales for each of the last three fiscal years: Fiscal Year 2004 2003(Restated) 2002(Restated) Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of merchandise sold 64.8 67.0 65.6 Gross margin 35.2 33.0 34.4 Selling, general and administrative expenses 21.7 20.4 20.0 Depreciation and amortization 2.5 2.3 2.1 Preopening expenses 0.4 0.5 0.5 Operating income 10.6 9.8 11.8 Interest expense, net 0.6 0.7 0.6 Income before income taxes 10.0 9.1 11.2 Provision for income taxes 3.8 3.5 4.2 Net income 6.2 % 5.6 % 7.0 % Net sales. Net sales, number of stores, sales growth, net sales per selling square foot and comparable store base for the last three fiscal years were as follows: Fiscal Year 2004 2003 2002 Net sales (in thousands) $ 11,700,619 $ 10,282,094 $ 9,120,287 Number of stores open (end of period) 637 542 457 Sales growth all stores 13.8 % 12.7 % 21.8 % Sales growth comparable stores (a) 0.3 % (1.6 )% 5.3 % Net sales per selling square foot (b) $ 255 $ 268 $ 284 Comparable store base 457 382 320 (a) Comparable store sales growth for each period is based on sales of stores (including relocated or expanded stores) open throughout the full period and throughout the full prior period. (b) Net sales per selling square foot is calculated using net sales of stores that have been open for the full year divided by their square footage of selling space. Net sales increased $1,418.5 million, or 13.8%, from $10,282.1 million in fiscal 2003 to $11,700.6 million in fiscal 2004. Net sales increased $1,395.1 million due to the opening of 95 new stores in fiscal 2004 and to the inclusion of a full year of operating results for the 85 stores opened in fiscal 2003. Comparable store sales increased $23.4 million, or 0.3%, in fiscal 2004. The number of transactions in comparable stores decreased 2.2% while the average transaction value increased 2.5%. The Accessories business had the strongest sales performance while the Mens business was the most difficult. The Northeast region had the strongest comparable store sales performance while the Midwest region, which is the most mature region, was the most difficult. Net sales increased $1,161.8 million, or 12.7%, from $9,120.3 million in fiscal 2002 to $10,282.1 million in fiscal 2003. Net sales increased $1,294.2 million due to the opening of 85 new stores in fiscal 2003 and to the inclusion of a full year of sales for the 75 stores opened in fiscal 2002. Comparable store sales decreased $132.4 million, or 1.6%, in fiscal 2003. 11 Gross margin. The Companys gross margin as a percent of net sales was 35.2% for fiscal 2004 compared to 33.0% for fiscal 2003. Approximately 50 basis points of the increase is attributable to the adoption of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion). Gross margin increased $718.5 million from $3,395.1 million in fiscal 2003 to $4,113.6 million in fiscal 2004. Gross margin increased $501.5 million due to the opening of 95 new stores in fiscal 2004 and to the inclusion of a full year of operating results for the 85 stores opened in fiscal 2003. Comparable store gross margin increased $217.0 million due mainly to lower levels of clearance sales, improved gross margin on the clearance sales and the EITF No. 02 16 effect. The merchandise category that was the largest contributor to the gross margin rate increase was womens apparel. Gross margin increased $256.0 million from $3,139.1 million in fiscal 2002 to $3,395.1 million in fiscal 2003. Gross margin increased $389.8 million due to the opening of 85 new stores in fiscal 2003 and to the inclusion of a full year of operating results for the 75 stores opened in fiscal 2002. Comparable store gross margin decreased $133.8 million due to increased markdowns. The Companys gross margin as a percent of net sales was 33.0% for fiscal 2003 compared to 34.4% for fiscal 2002. The largest contributor to the gross margin rate decline was womens apparel. The Companys merchandise mix is reflected in the table below: Fiscal Year 2004 2003 2002 Womens 32.5 % 32.1 % 32.6 % Mens 18.5 % 19.0 % 19.3 % Home 18.5 % 18.4 % 18.0 % Childrens 13.4 % 13.5 % 13.2 % Accessories 9.0 % 8.7 % 8.6 % Footwear 8.1 % 8.3 % 8.3 % Selling, general and administrative expenses. S,G&A expenses include all direct store expenses such as payroll, occupancy and store supplies and all costs associated with the Companys distribution centers, advertising and corporate functions, but exclude depreciation and amortization. S,G&A expenses increased $437.9 million, or 20.8%, to $2,539.6 million in fiscal 2004 compared to $2,101.7 million in fiscal 2003. S,G&A expenses as a percent of net sales increased from 20.4% in fiscal 2003 to 21.7% in fiscal 2004, an increase of 126 basis points. Store operating expenses increased 19.1%, which is consistent with the Companys square footage growth of 18.7%. As a percent of sales, store operating expenses increased 63 basis points in fiscal 2004. Advertising expenses increased 85 basis points primarily due to the adoption of EITF No. 02 16 (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion), which had an unfavorable impact of approximately 60 basis points. These increases were offset by a 10 basis point reduction in distribution expenses attributable to increased productivity on a units per hour basis at the distribution centers, a 10 basis point reduction in credit operations and a 2 basis point reduction in corporate expenses. S,G&A expenses increased $275.0 million, or 15.1%, to $2,101.7 million in fiscal 2003 compared to $1,826.7 million in fiscal 2002. S,G&A expenses as a percent of net sales increased from 20.0% in fiscal 2002 to 20.4% in fiscal 2003. The 41 basis point rate increase consisted of a 75 basis point increase in store operating costs and an advertising expense increase of 18 basis points. This was offset by a 20 basis point reduction in corporate expenses, a 19 basis point reduction in distribution expenses and a 13 basis point reduction in credit operations. Depreciation and amortization. The total amount of depreciation and amortization increased from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 due to the addition of new stores, the remodeling of existing stores and the mix of owned versus leased stores. Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales was 2.5%, 2.3% and 2.1% for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 12 Preopening expenses. Preopening expenses are expensed as incurred and relate to the costs incurred prior to new store openings which includes advertising, hiring, and training costs for new employees, processing and transporting initial merchandise and step rent expense. The average cost per store fluctuates based on the mix of stores opened in new markets versus fill in markets, with new markets being more expensive. The average cost to open the 95 new stores in fiscal 2004 was $540,000, the average cost to open the 85 new stores in fiscal 2003 was $592,000 and the average cost to open the 75 new stores in fiscal 2002 was $429,000. The decrease in the average cost to open a store in fiscal 2004 was due to entries made into less expensive new markets. Interest expense. Net interest expense decreased $10.4 million from $72.9 million in fiscal 2003 to $62.5 million in fiscal 2004. Of the decrease, $6.1 million is attributed to the write off of deferred financing fees related to the redemption of the Companys Liquid Yield Option Subordinated Notes (LYONs) in the second quarter of 2003. The remaining decrease is primarily attributable to the redemption of the 2.75% LYONs during the second quarter of 2003. Net interest expense in fiscal 2003 increased $16.9 million from $56.0 million in fiscal 2002 to $72.9 million. Income taxes. The Companys effective tax rate was 37.8% in fiscal 2004 , fiscal 2003 and in fiscal 2002. Inflation The Company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations during the periods presented. However, there can be no assurance that the Companys business will not be affected by inflation in the future. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys primary ongoing cash requirements are for capital expenditures in connection with the expansion and remodeling programs, seasonal and new store inventory purchases, and the growth in credit card accounts receivable. The Companys primary sources of funds for its business activities are cash flow from operations and short term trade credit. Operating activities. Cash flow provided by operations was $947.7 million in fiscal 2004 compared to $754.5 million in fiscal 2003, a $193.2 million increase. The primary sources of cash flow provided by operations were net income before depreciation and amortization and a $172.1 million increase in accounts payable, as discussed below. The primary uses of cash flow were $889.6 million of capital expenditures, a $340.0 million increase in merchandise inventories and a $239.5 million increase in the accounts receivable portfolio, as discussed below. Short term trade credit, in the form of extended payment terms for inventory purchases, represents a significant source of financing for merchandise inventories. Seasonal cash needs are met by financing secured by proprietary accounts receivable and lines of credit available under its revolving credit facilities. The Companys working capital and inventory levels typically build throughout the fall, peaking during the holiday selling season. Key financial ratios that provide certain measures of the Companys liquidity are as follows: January 29, 2005 January 31, 2004 (Restated) February 1, 2003 (Restated) ($ In Thousands) Working capital $ 2,187,379 $ 1,902,280 $ 1,776,029 Current ratio 2.50:1 2.69:1 2.18:1 Debt / capitalization 18.2 % 20.8 % 28.9 % The decrease in the Companys current ratio in fiscal 2004 is due to accounts payable increasing at a higher rate than inventory. The improvement in the debt / capitalization percentage in fiscal 2004 was due to an increase in retained earnings as a result of growth in net income in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 of 25.7%. The improvement in the Companys current ratio and debt / capitalization percentage in fiscal 2003 was due to the redemption of the Companys LYONs for $346.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2003. 13 The Companys accounts receivable at January 29, 2005 increased $239.5 million, or 20.8%, over the January 31, 2004 balance. The increase is primarily due to a 23.9% increase in proprietary credit card sales offset by increased payment rates. Net write offs decreased to 0.9% of Kohls charge sales in fiscal 2004 from 1.1% in fiscal 2003. As a result, the allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced to 1.7% of gross accounts receivable in fiscal 2004 from 1.9% in fiscal 2003. The Companys credit card program supports earnings growth by driving sales through promotional events and through the growth in the proprietary credit card financial performance. The following table summarizes information related to Kohls proprietary credit card receivables: January 29,2005 January 31,2004 February 1,2003 ($ In Thousands) Gross accounts receivable $ 1,414,289 $ 1,172,678 $ 1,011,690 Allowance for doubtful accounts $ 24,657 $ 22,521 $ 20,880 Allowance as a % of gross accounts receivable 1.7 % 1.9 % 2.1 % Accounts receivable turnover (rolling 4 quarters)* 3.8 x 3.6 x 3.5 x Proprietary credit card share 39.2 % 36.0 % 34.3 % Pre tax credit card contribution $ 105,734 $ 84,644 $ 67,412 Accounts over 60 days past due 2.5 % 2.7 % 3.5 % * Credit card sales divided by average quarterly gross accounts receivable At January 29, 2005, the Companys merchandise inventories increased $340.0 million, an increase of 21.2% from the January 31, 2004, balance of $1,607.0 million. On an average store basis, the inventory at January 29, 2005, was up approximately 3.1%. Accounts payable increased $172.1 million to $704.7 million at January 29, 2005, from the January 31, 2004, balance primarily due to the timing of new store receipts and an increase in spring transitional receipts in December and January. Investing activities. Capital expenditures include costs for new store openings, store remodels, distribution center openings, the expansion of the corporate office and other base capital needs. The Companys capital expenditures, including favorable lease rights, were $889.6 million during fiscal 2004, $831.6 million during fiscal 2003 and $716.0 million during fiscal 2002. The Company opened 95 new stores and remodeled 26 stores in fiscal 2004 increasing total square footage by approximately 18.7%, which is consistent with managements expansion strategy. In addition, the Company continued to make capital investments for information systems, distribution capacity and other infrastructure to support the Companys growth. The Company plans to open approximately 95 new stores in fiscal 2005, which represents approximately a 15.0% growth in square footage. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2005 are currently expected to be approximately $875 million. Capital expenditures include costs for new store openings, store remodels, the construction of a distribution center in Macon, GA, and other base capital needs. The amount of capital expenditures fluctuate as a result of the timing of new store capital spending, the mix of owned, leased and acquired stores, the number of stores remodeled and the timing of opening distribution centers. The Company does not anticipate that its planned expansion will be limited by any restrictive covenants in its financing agreements. The Companys capital structure is well positioned to support its expansion plans. The Company anticipates that internally generated cash flows will be the primary source of funding for future growth. Financing activities. The Company anticipates that it will be able to satisfy its working capital requirements, planned capital expenditures and debt service requirements with available cash and short term investments, proceeds from cash flows from operations, short term trade credit, financing secured by its proprietary credit card accounts receivable, seasonal borrowings under its revolving credit facilities and other sources of financing. The Company expects to generate adequate cash flows from operating activities to sustain current levels of operations. The Company maintains favorable banking relationships and anticipates that the necessary credit agreements will be extended or new agreements will be entered into in order to provide future borrowing requirements as needed. 14 As of March 2, 2005, the Company maintains the following credit ratings: Credit Ratings Moodys Standard& Poors Fitch Long term debt A3 A A The Company has a $225 million Receivable Purchase Agreement (RPA) with Preferred Receivables Funding Corporation, a certain investor and Bank One as agent, which is renewable annually, at the Companys request and the investors option. Pursuant to the RPA, the Company periodically sells, generally with recourse, an undivided interest in the Companys private label credit card receivables. At January 29, 2005, and January 31, 2004, no receivables were sold. For financial reporting purposes, receivables sold are accounted for on the consolidated balance sheet as secured borrowings. In November 2002, the Company issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of non callable 6% unsecured senior debentures due January 15, 2033. Net proceeds, excluding expenses, were $297.8 million and have been used for general corporate purposes, including continued store growth. In July 2002, the Company executed two unsecured revolving bank credit facilities. The first is a $532 million facility maturing July 10, 2007. The second is a $133 million 364 day facility that is renewable at the Companys request and at the banks option. The current term of this facility matures on July 8, 2005. Depending on the type of advance under these facilities, amounts borrowed bear interest at competitive bid rates; the LIBOR plus a margin, based on the Companys long term unsecured debt rating; or the agent banks base rate. In June 2000, the Company issued $551.5 million aggregate principal amount of convertible debt in the form of LYONs due 2020. Net proceeds, excluding expenses, were $319.4 million. On June 13, 2003, the holders of approximately 99.5% of the Companys outstanding LYONs exercised their options to redeem their notes, in accordance with the terms of the LYONs. The remaining LYONs were called by the Company on August 1, 2003. The Company elected to redeem all of these notes for cash. The total amount payable by the Company for the LYONs redeemed was $346.6 million, which was paid with available funds. In conjunction with the redemption, the Company wrote off the remaining deferred financing costs related to the LYONs during the second quarter of 2003. The write off of $6.1 million is included in interest expense for fiscal 2003. Outlook The Company continues to be focused on delivering approximately 20% earnings growth per year. In fiscal 2005, the Companys preliminary earnings guidance is based upon a mid single digit comparable store sales increase. With the progress the Company made in fiscal 2004 on improving merchandise content, inventory management, in store shopping experience and marketing, the Company feels it is well positioned to return to mid single digit comparable store sales in 2005. As a result, after taking into account expensing of stock options and the change in lease accounting, the Company expects fiscal 2005 earnings to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.50 per diluted share. Contractual Obligations The Company has aggregate contractual obligations of $10,277.4 million related to debt repayments, capital leases, operating leases and royalties as follows: Fiscal Year 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total (In Thousands) Long term debt (a) $ 65,623 $ 162,543 $ 59,144 $ 59,104 $ 58,775 $ 1,809,949 $ 2,215,138 Capital leases (a) 12,169 12,182 12,280 12,469 12,406 147,160 208,666 Operating leases 314,572 324,013 316,966 311,076 311,128 6,218,443 7,796,198 Royalties 5,045 5,286 10,087 10,500 12,075 14,438 57,431 Total $ 397,409 $ 504,024 $ 398,477 $ 393,149 $ 394,384 $ 8,189,990 $ 10,277,433 (a) Annual commitments on long term debt and capital leases are inclusive of related interest costs which total $1,218.5 million and $98.4 million, respectively. 15 The Company has entered into future capital lease commitments for buildings and equipment that total approximately $72.8 million at January 29, 2005, which have not been recorded as the related buildings are under construction and the equipment is not in use. The Company also has outstanding letters of credit and stand by letters of credit that total approximately $42.5 million at January 29, 2005. If certain conditions were met under these arrangements, the Company would be required to satisfy the obligations in cash. Due to the nature of these arrangements and based on historical experience, the Company does not expect to make any significant payments. Therefore, they have been excluded from the preceding table. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has not provided any financial guarantees as of January 29, 2005. All purchase obligations are cancelable and therefore are not included in the above table. The Company has not created, and is not party to, any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating the Companys business. The Company does not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect the Companys liquidity or the availability of capital resources. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. A discussion of the more significant estimates follows. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts as an estimate of the accounts receivable balance that may not be collected. The Company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on the aging of accounts, historical write off experience and specific review for potential bad debts. Delinquent accounts are written off automatically after the passage of 180 days without receiving a full scheduled monthly payment. Accounts are written off sooner in the event of customer bankruptcy or other circumstances that make further collection unlikely. For all other accounts, the Company recognizes reserves for bad debts based on the length of time the accounts are past due and the anticipated future write offs based on historical experience. Factors that would cause this allowance to increase primarily relate to increased customer bankruptcies or other difficulties that make further collection unlikely. Conversely, improved write off experience and aging of receivables would result in a decrease in the provision. Retail Inventory Method and Inventory Valuation The Company values its inventory at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on the last in, first out (LIFO) basis using the retail inventory method (RIM). Under RIM, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail value inventories. RIM is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality. The use of the retail inventory method will result in inventories being valued at the lower of cost or market as markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories. 16 Based on a review of historical clearance markdowns, current business trends, expected vendor funding and discontinued merchandise categories, an adjustment to inventory is recorded to reflect additional markdowns which are estimated to be necessary to liquidate existing clearance inventories and reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market. Management believes that the Companys inventory valuation approximates the net realizable value of clearance inventory and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market. Vendor Allowances The Company records vendor allowances and discounts in the income statement when the purpose for which those monies were designated is fulfilled. Allowances provided by vendors generally relate to profitability of inventory recently sold and, accordingly, are reflected as reductions to cost of merchandise sold as negotiated. Vendor allowances received for advertising or fixture programs reduce the Companys expense or expenditure for the related advertising or fixture program. Vendors participation in the selling of merchandise will fluctuate based on the amount of promotional and clearance markdowns necessary to liquidate the inventory. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, Business and Summary of Accounting Policies. Insurance Reserve Estimates The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation, general liability and employee related health care benefits, a portion of which is paid by its associates. The Company determines the estimates for the liabilities associated with these risks by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. A change in claims frequency and severity of claims from historical experience as well as changes in state statutes and the mix of states in which the Company operates could result in a change to the required reserve levels. Under its workers compensation and general liability insurance policies, the Company retains the initial risk of $500,000 and $250,000, respectively, per occurrence. Impairment of Assets and Closed Store Reserves The Company has a significant investment in property and equipment and favorable lease rights. The related depreciation and amortization is computed using estimated useful lives of up to 50 years. The Company reviews long lived assets held for use (including favorable lease rights) for impairment annually or whenever an event, such as decisions to close a store, indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The Company has historically not experienced any significant impairment of long lived assets or closed store reserves. Decisions to close a store can also result in accelerated depreciation over the revised useful life. If the store is leased, a reserve is set up for the discounted difference between the rent and the expected sublease rental income when the location is no longer in use. A significant change in cash flows, market valuation, demand for real estate or other factors, could result in an increase or decrease in the reserve requirement or impairment charge. Income Taxes The Company pays income taxes based on tax statutes, regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which it operates. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various taxing authorities. The Companys effective income tax rate was 37.8% in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002. The effective rate is impacted by changes in law, location of new stores, level of earnings and the result of tax audits. Operating Leases The Company leases retail stores under operating leases. Many lease agreements contain rent holidays, rent escalation clauses and or contingent rent provisions. The Company recognizes rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term, including cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty. The Company uses a time period for its straight line rent expense calculation that equals or exceeds the time period used for depreciation. In addition, the commencement date of the lease term is the earlier of the date when the Company becomes legally obligated for the rent payments or the date when the Company takes possession of the building for initial setup of fixtures and merchandise. 17 New Accounting Pronouncements On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share Based Payment, which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. SFAS No. 123R supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123R is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. As of January 29, 2005, the Company had two long term compensation plans, which are described in Note 9, Preferred and Common Stock, to the consolidated financial statements. The Company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using APB No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for those plans. No stock based employee compensation expense is reflected in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 net income as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock at the date of grant and the number of shares is fixed. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS No. 123Rs fair value method will have an impact on the Companys results of operations, although it will have no impact on the Companys overall financial position. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R is expected to reduce diluted net income per share by approximately $0.08 $0.09 in fiscal 2005 with the expense being incurred in approximately equal quarterly amounts throughout the year. If the Company had adopted SFAS No. 123R in prior periods, the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and net income per share in the table in Note 1, Business and Summary of Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 123R also requires the benefit of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. While the Company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future, the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were $40,745,000, $42,013,000 and $45,831,000 in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. SFAS No. 123R must be adopted no later than August 1, 2005 with early adoption permitted in periods in which the financial statements have not yet been issued. Effective the beginning of fiscal 2005, the Company will adopt SFAS No. 123R using the modified retrospective method. The Company will restate its financial statements based on the amounts previously recognized under SFAS No. 123 for purposes of pro forma disclosure in the 2005 quarterly releases and 2005 Forms 10 Q. Forward Looking Information/Risk Factors Items 1, 3, 5, 7 and 7A of this Form 10 K contain forward looking statements, subject to protections under federal law. The Company intends words such as believes, anticipates, plans, may, will, should, expects and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements. In addition, statements covering the Companys future sales or financial performance and the Companys plans, performance and other objectives, expectations or intentions are forward looking statements, such as statements regarding the Companys liquidity, debt service requirements, planned capital expenditures, future store openings and adequacy of capital resources and reserves. There are a number of important factors that could cause the Companys results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward looking statements, including among others, those risk factors described in Exhibit 99.1 attached to this Form 10 K and incorporated herein by this reference. Forward looking statements relate to the date made, and the Company undertakes no obligations to update them. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Companys primary exposure to market risk consists of changes in interest rates or borrowings. At January 29, 2005, the Companys long term debt, excluding capital leases, was $996.6 million, all of which is fixed rate debt. 18 Long term fixed rate debt is utilized as a primary source of capital. When these debt instruments mature, the Company may refinance such debt at then existing market interest rates, which may be more or less than interest rates on the maturing debt. If interest rates on the existing fixed rate debt outstanding at January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004 changed by 100 basis points, the Companys annual interest expense would change by $10.0 million and $10.1 million, respectively. During fiscal 2004, average borrowings under the Companys variable rate revolving credit facilities and its short term financing of its proprietary accounts receivable were $76.1 million. If interest rates on the average fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 variable rate debt changed by 100 basis points, the Companys annual interest expense would change by $761,000 and $797,000, respectively, assuming comparable borrowing levels. During fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, the Company did not enter into any derivative financial instruments.
