Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary Kohls mission is to be the leading family focused, value oriented, specialty department store offering quality, exclusive and national brand merchandise to the customer in an environment that is convenient, friendly and exciting. Kohls operates from coast to coast, having grown from 76 stores in six states at the time of its initial public offering (IPO) in 1992 to 732 stores in 41 states at January 28, 2006. In fiscal 2005, the Company continued its expansion with entries into the Buffalo, NY; Orlando, FL; and Jacksonville, FL markets. Kohls concentrates on profitable expansion. The Companys future growth plans are to increase its presence in all of the regions it currently serves and to expand into new markets. The Company plans to add approximately 500 stores over the next five years. The Company opened 95 stores in fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2006, the Company plans to open approximately 80 85 new stores with continual expansion in Florida, and entry into the Pacific Northwest with stores opening in Washington and Oregon. The store expansion involves all three of the Companys prototypes: suburban, small, and urban, with the primary vehicle remaining the suburban prototype. The Companys disciplined approach to new store selection ensures that new store locations achieve an appropriate return on investment. The Companys capital structure is well positioned to continue to support its expansion plans. Internally generated cash flows will continue to be the primary source of the funding required for future growth. In addition, the Company has long term debt ratings of A3 by Moodys, BBB+ by Standard & Poors and A by Fitch. The Companys revenues are generated through sales from existing stores and through sales from new stores opened as a result of its expansion program. In order to increase sales productivity in existing stores and attract new customers, the Company strives to add freshness in its assortments through the addition of new and exclusive brands and extension of existing brands into new classifications. The Company also continues to invest in updating its stores with a goal of remodeling stores approximately every 8 10 years. Critical to the Companys successful growth is the infrastructure that has been developed and refined since becoming a public company in 1992. Over the past five years, sales have grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 17% and net income has grown at a CAGR of approximately 20%. This growth was achieved through a combination of comparable store sales increases, square footage growth, gross margin expansion and selling, general and administrative (S,G&A) expense control. Fiscal 2005 was a solid year from an earnings and operational perspective. The Company earned $842 million in net income, an increase of 19.7% over last year. The Companys net sales increased 14.5% while comparable store sales increased 3.4%. In fiscal 2005, the Company achieved the highest gross margin rate in its history. The Companys S,G&A expenses increased 14.7% over fiscal 2004 which was in line with the Companys square footage growth of 15.1%. The Companys earnings guidance for fiscal 2006 is to achieve net income growth of 13% to 18%, assuming a comparable store sales increase of 2% to 4% and total sales growth of 12% to 14%. The Company expects to leverage S,G&A expenses with an approximately 2% comparable store sales increase in fiscal 2006. In order to achieve this guidance, the Company will continue to focus on the following initiatives: Merchandise content Inventory management 12 In store shopping experience Differentiation in marketing The Company progressed on these initiatives in fiscal 2005. The merchandise content was broadened by adding new national, exclusive and private brands. The Company continued its focus on inventory management and increased its effectiveness of being in stock by flowing goods more frequently and closer to the time of sale. The shopping experience is where everything the Company does comes together. The Company organized departments by lifestyle for ease of shopping, differentiated special sizes, added graphics that highlight key trends and presented merchandise to give customers ideas on how to create their own looks. These initiatives not only make it easier to shop, but also more exciting. In 2006, the Company is focused on continuing to introduce new brands and extend successful brands into additional areas of the store to build awareness with its existing customers and drive more frequent trips as well as gain new customers. In order to achieve this goal, the Company will continue to use a fully integrated marketing approach using circulars, direct mail, radio, magazines, internet and television to brand Kohls. The Companys marketing strategies will continue to evolve as it seeks new and exciting ways to reach its customers. The Companys long term goal remains to increase net income approximately 15% 20% annually through a combination of new store and comparable store sales growth, slight increase annually in the gross margin rate, and modest S,G&A expense leverage on the increasing sales base. Restatement of Financial Statements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share Based Payment, which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. SFAS No. 123R supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123R is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. The Company adopted SFAS No. 123R on January 30, 2005 requiring the Company to recognize expense related to the fair value of its employee stock option awards. The Company adopted the modified retrospective method, which requires the prior period financial statements be restated under the provisions of SFAS No. 123R to recognize compensation cost in the amounts previously reported in the pro forma footnote disclosures. As a result of adopting SFAS No. 123R, the Companys income before income taxes for the years ended January 28, 2006, January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004 are $40.4 million, $43.4 million and $55.4 million lower, respectively, than if it had continued to account for the share based compensation under APB No. 25. Prior to adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company presented all tax benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires that cash flows resulting from the tax deductions in excess of the compensation costs recognized for those options be presented as financing cash flows. See Note 2, Restatement of Financial Statements, to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the effects of these changes on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 29, 2005, as well as on the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income and Cash Flows for fiscal years 2004 and 2003. The accompanying Managements Discussion and Analysis gives effect to these changes. The discussion and analysis below further explains the Companys results of operations for fiscal 2005. 13 Results of Operations The Companys net income was $842.0 million in fiscal 2005 compared to $703.4 million in fiscal 2004, an increase of $138.6 million or 19.7%. Fiscal 2004 net income increased 28.7% over fiscal 2003 net income of $546.5 million. Components of net income. The following table sets forth statement of operations data as a percentage of net sales for each of the last three fiscal years: Fiscal Year 2005 2004(Restated) 2003(Restated) Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of merchandise sold 64.5 64.8 67.0 Gross margin 35.5 35.2 33.0 Selling, general and administrative expenses 22.1 22.1 21.0 Depreciation and amortization 2.5 2.5 2.3 Preopening expenses 0.3 0.4 0.4 Operating income 10.6 10.2 9.3 Interest expense, net 0.6 0.5 0.8 Income before income taxes 10.0 9.7 8.5 Provision for income taxes 3.7 3.7 3.2 Net income 6.3 % 6.0 % 5.3 % Net sales. Net sales, number of stores, sales growth, net sales per selling square foot and comparable store base for the last three fiscal years were as follows: Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Net sales (in thousands) $ 13,402,217 $ 11,700,619 $ 10,282,094 Number of stores open (end of period) 732 637 542 Sales growth all stores 14.5 % 13.8 % 12.7 % Sales growth comparable stores (a) 3.4 % 0.3 % (1.6 )% Net sales per selling square foot (b) $ 252 $ 255 $ 268 Comparable store base 542 457 382 (a) Comparable store sales growth for each period is based on sales of stores (including relocated or expanded stores) open throughout the full period and throughout the full prior period. (b) Net sales per selling square foot is calculated using net sales of stores that have been open for the full year divided by their square footage of selling space. Net sales increased $1,701.6 million, or 14.5%, from $11,700.6 million in fiscal 2004 to $13,402.2 million in fiscal 2005. Net sales increased $1,336.4 million due to the opening of 95 new stores in fiscal 2005 and to the inclusion of a full year of operating results for the 95 stores opened in fiscal 2004. Comparable store sales increased $365.2 million, or 3.4%, in fiscal 2005. The number of transactions increased 1.2% and the average transaction value increased 2.2% in comparable stores. All areas of the business had positive sales results with the Mens and Accessories businesses having the strongest sales performance. All regions had positive comparable sales increases. The Southwest region had the strongest comparable store sales performance. Net sales increased $1,418.5 million, or 13.8%, from $10,282.1 million in fiscal 2003 to $11,700.6 million in fiscal 2004. Net sales increased $1,395.1 million due to the opening of 95 new stores in fiscal 2004 and to the inclusion of a full year of operating results for the 85 stores opened in fiscal 2003. Comparable store sales increased $23.4 million, or 0.3%, in fiscal 2004. 14 The Companys merchandise mix is reflected in the table below: Fiscal Year 2005 2004 2003 Womens 32.6 % 32.5 % 32.1 % Mens 18.6 % 18.5 % 19.0 % Home 18.4 % 18.5 % 18.4 % Childrens 13.0 % 13.4 % 13.5 % Accessories 9.2 % 9.0 % 8.7 % Footwear 8.2 % 8.1 % 8.3 % Gross margin. The Companys gross margin as a percent of net sales was 35.5% for fiscal 2005 compared to 35.2% for fiscal 2004. Gross margin increased $649.3 million from $4,113.6 million in fiscal 2004 to $4,762.9 million in fiscal 2005. Gross margin increased $459.0 million due to the opening of 95 new stores in fiscal 2005 and to the inclusion of a full year of operating results for the 95 stores opened in fiscal 2004. The comparable store gross margin increase of $190.3 million was a result of improved gross margin on clearance sales, better merchandise content and improved inventory flow. The merchandise category that was the largest contributor to the gross margin rate increase was Womens. Gross margin increased $718.5 million from $3,395.1 million in fiscal 2003 to $4,113.6 million in fiscal 2004. Gross margin increased $501.5 million due to the opening of 95 new stores in fiscal 2004 and to the inclusion of a full year of operating results for the 85 stores opened in fiscal 2003. Comparable store gross margin increased $217.0 million due mainly to lower level of clearance sales, improved gross margin on the clearance sales and the adoption of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor, in fiscal 2004. The largest contributor to the gross margin rate increase was Womens. Selling, general and administrative expenses. S,G&A expenses include all direct store expenses such as payroll, occupancy and store supplies and all costs associated with the Companys distribution centers, advertising and corporate functions, but exclude depreciation and amortization. S,G&A expenses increased $380.5 million, or 14.7%, to $2,963.5 million in fiscal 2005 compared to $2,583.0 million in fiscal 2004. S,G&A expenses as a percent of net sales was 22.1% in both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004. Store operating expenses increased 15.5%, which is consistent with the Companys square footage growth of 15.1%. The Company leveraged distribution expenses due to the increased productivity on a units per hour basis. The Company also leveraged credit expenses which were offset by increased corporate expenses as a percent of net sales. S,G&A expenses increased $426.0 million, or 19.7%, to $2,583.0 million in fiscal 2004 compared to $2,157.0 million in fiscal 2003. S,G&A expenses as a percent of net sales increased from 21.0% in fiscal 2003 to 22.1% in fiscal 2004, an increase of 110 basis points. Store operating expenses increased 18.5%, which is consistent with the Companys square footage growth of 18.7%. Advertising expenses increased 85 basis points primarily due to the adoption of EITF 02 16 (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion), which had an unfavorable impact of approximately 60 basis points. These increases were offset by a 12 basis point reduction in corporate expenses, a 10 basis point reduction in distribution expenses and a 10 basis point reduction in credit operations. Depreciation and amortization. The total amount of depreciation and amortization increased from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 due to the addition of new stores and the mix of owned compared to leased stores. Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales was 2.5% for both fiscal 2005 and 2004 and was 2.3% for fiscal 2003. Preopening expenses. Preopening expenses are expensed as incurred and relate to the costs incurred prior to new store openings which includes advertising, hiring, and training costs for new employees, processing and transporting initial merchandise and rent expense. The average cost per store fluctuates based on the mix of stores opened in new markets compared to fill in markets, with new markets being more expensive. The average 15 cost to open the 95 new stores in fiscal 2005 was $481,000, the average cost to open the 95 new stores in fiscal 2004 was $540,000 and the average cost to open the 85 new stores in fiscal 2003 was $592,000. The decrease in the average cost to open a store in fiscal 2005 was due to the mix of stores opened in new markets compared to fill in markets as well as entries made into less expensive markets. Interest expense. Net interest expense increased $7.9 million from $62.5 million in fiscal 2004 to $70.4 million in fiscal 2005. Of the increase, $6.0 million is attributed to decreased capitalized interest due to less capital spending. Net interest expense in fiscal 2004 decreased $10.4 million from $72.9 million in fiscal 2003 to $62.5 million. The decrease was a result of writing off $6.1 million in deferred financing fees related to the redemption of the Companys Liquid Yield Option Subordinated Notes (LYONs) in the second quarter of fiscal 2003. The remaining decrease is primarily attributable to the redemption of the 2.75% LYONs during the second quarter of fiscal 2003. Income taxes. The Companys effective tax rate was 37.4% in fiscal 2005 and was 37.8% in both fiscal 2004 and in fiscal 2003. The decrease in the fiscal 2005 effective tax rate was a result of a tax adjustment of $4.9 million due to the favorable resolution of certain state tax matters. Inflation The Company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations during the periods presented. However, there can be no assurance that the Companys business will not be affected by inflation in the future. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys primary ongoing cash requirements are for capital expenditures in connection with the expansion and remodeling programs, seasonal and new store inventory purchases, and the growth in credit card accounts receivable. The Companys primary sources of funds for its business activities are cash flow provided by operations and short term trade credit. Operating activities. Cash flow provided by operations was $881.7 million in fiscal 2005 compared to $937.1 million in fiscal 2004, a $55.4 million decrease. The primary sources of cash flow provided by operations were net income before depreciation and amortization and a $125.3 million increase in accounts payable, as discussed below. The primary uses of cash flow were a $290.6 million increase in merchandise inventories and a $262.4 million increase in the accounts receivable portfolio, as discussed below. Short term trade credit, in the form of extended payment terms for inventory purchases, represents a significant source of financing for merchandise inventories. Seasonal cash needs are met by financing secured by proprietary accounts receivable and lines of credit available under its revolving credit facilities. The Companys working capital and inventory levels typically build throughout the fall, peaking during the holiday selling season. Key financial ratios that provide certain measures of the Companys liquidity are as follows: January 28,2006 January 29,2005(Restated) January 31,2004(Restated) ($ In Thousands) Working capital $ 2,519,597 $ 2,187,379 $ 1,902,280 Current ratio 2.44:1 2.50:1 2.69:1 Debt / capitalization 16.2 % 18.0 % 20.5 % Earnings to fixed charges 6.35 5.83 4.90 The decrease in the Companys current ratio in fiscal 2005 is due to accounts payable increasing at a higher rate than inventory and the increase of $100.0 million in the current portion of long term debt. The decrease in the Companys current ratio in fiscal 2004 from fiscal 2003 is also due to accounts payable increasing at a higher rate than inventory. The improvement in the debt / capitalization percentage and earnings to fixed charges ratio in fiscal 2005 was due to an increase in retained earnings as a result of growth in net income in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 of 19.7%. The Companys accounts receivable at January 28, 2006 increased $262.4 million, or 18.9%, over the January 29, 2005 balance. The increase is primarily due to a 18.6% increase in proprietary credit card sales and a decrease in payment rates. Net write offs increased to 1.0% of Kohls charge sales in fiscal 2005 from 0.9% in fiscal 2004. The Companys incremental bad debt expense related to the revised bankruptcy legislation, effective 16 October 17, 2005, was $3.2 million. The Company believes write offs of delinquent accounts were accelerated due to the bankruptcy legislation. As a result, the allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced to 1.6% of gross accounts receivable in fiscal 2005 from 1.7% in fiscal 2004. The Companys credit card program supports earnings growth by driving sales through promotional events and through the growth in the proprietary credit card financial performance. The following table summarizes information related to Kohls proprietary credit card receivables: January 28,2006 January 29,2005 January 31,2004 ($ In Thousands) Gross accounts receivable $ 1,678,400 $ 1,414,289 $ 1,172,678 Allowance for doubtful accounts $ 26,335 $ 24,657 $ 22,521 Allowance as a % of gross accounts receivable 1.6 % 1.7 % 1.9 % Accounts receivable turnover (rolling 4 quarters) * 3.8x 3.8x 3.6x Proprietary credit card share 40.6 % 39.2 % 36.0 % Accounts over 60 days past due 2.4 % 2.5 % 2.7 % * Credit card sales divided by average quarterly gross accounts receivable At January 28, 2006, the Companys merchandise inventories increased $290.6 million, an increase of 14.9% from the January 29, 2005, balance of $1,947.0 million. On an average store basis, the inventory at January 28, 2006, was flat to January 29, 2005. Accounts payable increased $125.3 million to $830.0 million at January 28, 2006, from the January 28, 2005, balance primarily due to an increase in stores and the execution of flowing goods closer to the point of sale. Investing activities. Capital expenditures include costs for new store openings, store remodels, distribution center openings, the expansion of the corporate office and other base capital needs. The Companys capital expenditures, including favorable lease rights, were $799.4 million during fiscal 2005, $889.6 million during fiscal 2004 and $831.6 million during fiscal 2003. The Company opened 95 new stores in fiscal 2005. In addition, the Company continued to make capital investments for information systems, distribution capacity and other infrastructure to support the Companys growth. The decrease in capital spending was a result of opening 17 stores during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 compared to 32 stores during the first quarter of fiscal 2005. The Company plans to open approximately 80 85 new stores in fiscal 2006. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2006 are currently expected to be in the range of $1.0 billion. Capital expenditures include costs for new store openings, store remodels, the construction of a distribution center in Patterson, CA and other base capital needs. The amount of capital expenditures fluctuate as a result of the timing of new store capital spending, the mix of owned, leased and acquired stores, the number of stores remodeled and the timing of opening distribution centers. The Company does not anticipate that its planned expansion will be limited by any restrictive covenants in its financing agreements. The Companys capital structure is well positioned to support its expansion plans. The Company anticipates that internally generated cash flows will be the primary source of funding for future growth. Financing activities. The Company anticipates that it will be able to satisfy its working capital requirements, planned capital expenditures and debt service requirements with available cash and short term investments, proceeds from cash flows from operations, short term trade credit, financing secured by its proprietary credit card accounts receivable, seasonal borrowings under its revolving credit facilities and other sources of financing. The Company expects to generate adequate cash flows from operating activities to sustain current levels of operations. The Company maintains favorable banking relationships and anticipates that the necessary credit agreements will be extended or new agreements will be entered into in order to provide future borrowing requirements as needed. 17 The Company maintains the following credit ratings: Credit Ratings Moodys Standard& Poors Fitch Long term debt A3 BBB+ A The Company has an agreement with Preferred Receivables Funding Corporation and JPMorgan Chase, as agent, under which the Company periodically sells, generally with recourse, an undivided interest in the revolving pool of its private label credit card receivables up to a maximum of $225 million. The agreement runs through December 14, 2006, and is renewable for one year intervals at the Companys request and the investors option. No receivables were sold as of January 28, 2006, or January 29, 2005. For financial reporting purposes, receivables sold are treated as secured borrowings. The Company has an unsecured revolving bank credit facility totaling $532 million. In addition, the Company also has two demand notes with availability totaling $50 million. Depending on the type of advance under these facilities, amounts borrowed bear interest at competitive bid rates; the LIBOR plus a margin, based on the Companys long term unsecured debt rating; or the agent banks base rate. Outlook The Companys earnings guidance for fiscal 2006 is to achieve net income growth of 13% to 18%, based upon a comparable store sales increase of 2% to 4% and total sales growth of 12% to 14%. The Company will attain this goal by introducing new brands and extending successful brands into additional areas of the store. The Company will also focus on improved receipt flow to improve transitions and lower clearance levels. Finally, the Company will continue to invest in both direct mail and broadcast media to support the new brand launches and to build sales momentum throughout the year. The Company will achieve its net income increase through a combination of new store and comparable store sales growth, improvement in gross margin rate and the assumption of S,G&A expense leverage at a 2% comparable sales increase. Contractual Obligations The Company has aggregate contractual obligations of $13,448.5 million related to debt repayments, capital leases, operating leases, royalties and purchase obligations as follows: Fiscal Year 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total (In Thousands) Long term debt (a) $ 162,547 $ 59,144 $ 59,104 $ 58,775 $ 58,775 $ 1,751,175 $ 2,149,520 Capital leases (a) 19,286 19,761 19,939 18,467 15,871 189,555 282,879 Operating leases 340,540 340,648 335,598 331,704 329,643 6,404,148 8,082,281 Royalties 7,221 13,462 15,250 17,731 20,969 1,688 76,321 Purchase obligations (b) 2,520,248 2,520,248 Other (c) 156,457 26,352 12,149 7,593 7,361 127,304 337,216 Total $ 3,206,299 $ 459,367 $ 442,040 $ 434,270 $ 432,619 $ 8,473,870 $ 13,448,465 (a) Annual commitments on long term debt and capital leases are inclusive of related interest costs which total $1,152.8 million and $125.6 million, respectively. (b) The Companys purchase obligations consist mainly of purchase orders for merchandise. Amounts committed under open purchase orders for merchandise are cancelable without penalty prior to a date that precedes the vendors scheduled shipment date. (c) The other category above includes commitments for stores to be opened in fiscal 2006 and 2007 and employment contracts. 18 The Company also has outstanding letters of credit and stand by letters of credit that total approximately $33.2 million at January 28, 2006. If certain conditions were met under these arrangements, the Company would be required to satisfy the obligations in cash. Due to the nature of these arrangements and based on historical experience, the Company does not expect to make any significant payments. Therefore, they have been excluded from the preceding table. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has not provided any financial guarantees as of January 28, 2006. The Company has not created, and is not party to, any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating the Companys business. The Company does not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect the Companys liquidity or the availability of capital resources. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. A discussion of the more significant estimates follows. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts as an estimate of the accounts receivable balance that may not be collected. The Company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on the aging of accounts, historical write off experience and specific review for potential bad debts. Delinquent accounts are written off automatically after the passage of 180 days without receiving a full scheduled monthly payment. Accounts are written off sooner in the event of customer bankruptcy or other circumstances that make further collection unlikely. For all other accounts, the Company recognizes reserves for bad debts based on the length of time the accounts are past due and the anticipated future write offs based on historical experience. Factors that would cause this allowance to increase primarily relate to increased customer bankruptcies or other difficulties that make further collection unlikely. Conversely, improved write off experience and aging of receivables would result in a decrease in the provision. Retail Inventory Method and Inventory Valuation The Company values its inventory at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on the first in, first out (FIFO) basis using the retail inventory method (RIM). Under RIM, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail value inventories. RIM is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality. The use of the retail inventory method will result in inventories being valued at the lower of cost or market as markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories. Based on a review of historical clearance markdowns, current business trends, expected vendor funding and discontinued merchandise categories, an adjustment to inventory is recorded to reflect additional markdowns which are estimated to be necessary to liquidate existing clearance inventories and reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market. Management believes that the Companys inventory valuation approximates the net realizable value of clearance inventory and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market. 19 Vendor Allowances The Company records vendor allowances and discounts in the income statement when the purpose for which those monies were designated is fulfilled. Allowances provided by vendors generally relate to profitability of inventory recently sold and, accordingly, are reflected as reductions to cost of merchandise sold as negotiated. Vendor allowances received for advertising or fixture programs reduce the Companys expense or expenditure for the related advertising or fixture program when appropriate. Vendors allowances will fluctuate based on the amount of promotional and clearance markdowns necessary to liquidate the inventory. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, Business and Summary of Accounting Policies. Insurance Reserve Estimates The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation, general liability and employee related health care benefits, a portion of which is paid by its associates. The Company determines the estimates for the liabilities associated with these risks by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. A change in claims frequency and severity of claims from historical experience as well as changes in state statutes and the mix of states in which the Company operates could result in a change to the required reserve levels. Under its workers compensation and general liability insurance policies, the Company retains the initial risk of $500,000 and $250,000, respectively, per occurrence. The Company also has a lifetime medical payment limit of $1.5 million. Impairment of Assets and Closed Store Reserves The Company has a significant investment in property and equipment and favorable lease rights. The related depreciation and amortization is computed using estimated useful lives of up to 50 years. The Company reviews whether indicators of impairment of long lived assets held for use (including favorable lease rights) are present annually or whenever an event, such as decisions to close a store, indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The Company has historically not experienced any significant impairment of long lived assets or closed store reserves. Decisions to close a store can also result in accelerated depreciation over the revised useful life. If the store is leased, a reserve is set up for the discounted difference between the rent and the expected sublease rental income when the location is no longer in use. A significant change in cash flows, market valuation, demand for real estate or other factors, could result in an increase or decrease in the reserve requirement or impairment charge. Income Taxes The Company pays income taxes based on tax statutes, regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which it operates. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various taxing authorities. The Companys effective income tax rate was 37.4% in fiscal 2005 and 37.8% in fiscal 2004 and 2003. The effective rate is impacted by changes in law, location of new stores, level of earnings and the result of tax audits. Operating Leases The Company leases retail stores under operating leases. Many lease agreements contain rent holidays, rent escalation clauses and or contingent rent provisions. The Company recognizes rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term, including cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty. The Company uses a time period for its straight line rent expense calculation that equals or exceeds the time period used for depreciation. In addition, the commencement date of the lease term is the earlier of the date when the Company becomes legally obligated for the rent payments or the date when the Company takes possession of the building for initial setup of fixtures and merchandise. New Accounting Pronouncements In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS No. 151 amends the guidance in ARB No. 43 on inventory pricing and clarifies that abnormal idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage are to be treated as current 20 period expenses and not a cost of inventory. The statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company does not expect this statement to have an impact on net earnings, cash flows or financial position upon adoption. In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47 (FIN 47) to clarify the guidance included in SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. FIN 47 requires companies to recognize a liability for the fair value of a legal obligation to perform asset retirement activities that are conditional on a future event if the amount can be reasonably estimated. If amounts cannot be reasonably estimated, certain disclosures are required about the unrecognized asset retirement obligations. FIN 47 was adopted by the Company in fiscal 2005. Adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, which establishes retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle. The statement is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. In June 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) released No. 05 6, Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements, was issued. It provides guidance on determining amortization periods for leasehold improvements purchased after lease inception or acquired in a business combination. Leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination should be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date of acquisition. Leasehold improvements that are placed in service significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of the lease term should be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are purchased. Effective for leasehold improvements purchased or acquired in reporting periods beginning after June 29, 2005. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Companys net earnings, cash flows or financial position. In October 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS 123 (R) 2, Practical Accommodation to the Application of Grant Date as Defined in FASB Statement No. 123(R) (FSP 123(R) 2). SFAS No. 123 (R) (FAS No. 123R) requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards when the award has been granted. One of the criteria for determining that an award has been granted is that the employer and its employees have a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of the award. Under FSP 123 (R) 2, a mutual understanding is assumed to exist on the date the award is approved by the Board of Directors and the key terms and conditions of the award are expected to be communicated to the individual within a relatively short time period from the date of approval. This FSP 123 (R) 2 is applicable upon initial adoption of SFAS No. 123 (R) or for companies who have already adopted SFAS No. 123R, the first reporting period after the FSP is posted to the FASB website. As required, the Company applied the guidance in FSP 123 (R) 2 beginning October 2005. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Companys net earnings, cash flows or financial position. In October 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS 13 1, Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred during a Construction Period (FSP 13 1). FSP 13 1 requires that rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during the construction period be recognized as rental expense. FSP 13 1 is applicable for the first reporting period after December 15, 2005. The Company has historically capitalized rental costs incurred during a construction period and the adoption of this guidance is expected to negatively impact net income per diluted share by approximately $0.03 in fiscal 2006. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Companys primary exposure to market risk consists of changes in interest rates or borrowings. At January 28, 2006, the Companys long term debt, excluding capital leases, was $996.7 million, all of which is fixed rate debt. Long term fixed rate debt is utilized as a primary source of capital. When these debt instruments mature, the Company may refinance such debt at then existing market interest rates, which may be more or less than interest 21 rates on the maturing debt. If interest rates on the existing fixed rate debt outstanding at January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005 changed by 100 basis points, the Companys annual interest expense would change by $10.0 million in each respective year. During fiscal 2005, average borrowings under the Companys variable rate revolving credit facilities and its short term financing of its proprietary accounts receivable were $79.0 million and $76.1 million at January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005, respectively. If interest rates on the average fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 variable rate debt changed by 100 basis points, the Companys annual interest expense would change by $790,000 and $761,000, respectively, assuming comparable borrowing levels. During fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, the Company did not enter into any derivative financial instruments.
