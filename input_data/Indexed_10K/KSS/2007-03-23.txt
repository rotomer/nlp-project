Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary Kohls mission is to be the leading family focused, value oriented, department store offering quality exclusive and national brand merchandise to the customer in an environment that is convenient, friendly and exciting. The Companys net sales increased 16.0% in fiscal 2006 to a record $15.5 billion. Comparable store sales increased 5.9% with all regions and all lines of business achieving positive comparable store sales growth each quarter. Operating income grew 28.1% to $1.8 billion and operating margin reached an all time high of 11.7%. Net income increased 31.7% to $1.1 billion or $3.31 per diluted share. This performance was driven by strong improvement in gross margin and selling, general and administrative (S,G&A) expense control. In April 2006, the Company completed the sale of its proprietary credit card business to JPMorgan Chase (Chase) for $1.6 billion and entered into a multi year agreement with Chase to share in the profitability of the credit card portfolio. The net proceeds were used to begin a Board of Directors authorized $2 billion share repurchase program. The Company repurchased 27.5 million shares at an average price of $59.23 in fiscal 2006, spending approximately $1.6 billion. Kohls continues to deliver on its real estate strategy, having grown from 76 stores in six states at the time of its initial public offering in 1992 to 817 stores in 45 states at February 3, 2007. Kohls continues to concentrate on profitable expansion and in fiscal 2006, opened 85 stores including its initial entry into the Portland, OR; Seattle, WA; and Tampa, FL markets. The Companys future growth plans are to increase its presence in all regions and expand into new markets. The Company continues to see more opportunities for strategic, profitable growth and by the end of fiscal 2010, expects to be operating over 1,200 stores. The store expansion involves all three of the Companys prototypes: suburban, small, and urban, with the primary vehicle remaining the suburban prototype. The Companys disciplined approach to new store selection ensures that new store locations achieve an appropriate return on investment. The Company also continues to invest in updating its stores with a goal of remodeling stores approximately every eight to ten years. The Companys capital structure is well positioned to continue to support its expansion plans. Internally generated cash flows will continue to be the primary source of the funding required for future growth. In addition, as of March 20, 2007, the Company had long term debt ratings of A3 by Moodys, BBB+ by Standard & Poors and A by Fitch. The Companys four strategic initiatives continue to be the roadmap to future growth. These initiatives concentrate on merchandise content, differentiation in marketing, inventory management and the in store shopping experience. The focus of the merchandising initiatives is to increase market share by expanding Kohls appeal to a broader range of customers. The introduction of new brands in 2006 such as Chaps in womens, Tony Hawk in young mens and boys as well as expansion of brands such as Candies and Apt. 9 helped the Company accomplish this goal. In 2007, the Company will add even more variety to its merchandise with new exclusive partnerships with Vera Wang, ELLE and Food Network. The marketing program is designed to differentiate Kohls in the marketplace. The Companys marketing focus in 2007 will be to continue the Only at Kohls theme, not only focusing on private brands but also nationally recognized brands found only at Kohls. In 2007, the Company will continue to utilize both direct mail and broadcast to build traffic around major events as well as increase brand affinity for Kohls. The Company will also focus on expanding share of wallet from its customers through an Explore the Store initiative. The majority of current customer transactions contain purchases from only one of the six lines of business. As the Company improves and better balances its content offerings across these lines of business, there will be potential for significant additional market share gain. The Company also continues to focus on receipt flow to improve turnover as well as meet customer expectations for in stock levels of merchandise. The Company introduced a new innovation store design in 2006 to make the stores more visually exciting and easier to shop. The Company plans to roll out elements of this format to all new and remodeled stores in 2007. 14 Table of Contents For fiscal 2007, the Company expects a total sales increase of 9% to 11%, a comparable store sales increase of 2% to 4%, a gross margin rate increase of 30 to 40 basis points and to achieve SG&A leverage at a 2% comparable store sales increase. Achieving these assumptions would result in earnings per diluted share of $3.68 to $3.84 for the year. Results of Operations The Companys net income was $1,108.7 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $842.0 million in fiscal 2005, an increase of $266.7 million or 31.7%. Fiscal 2005 net income increased 19.7% over fiscal 2004 net income of $703.4 million. Components of net income. The following table sets forth statement of income data as a percentage of net sales for each of the last three fiscal years: Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of merchandise sold 63.6 64.5 64.8 Gross margin 36.4 35.5 35.2 Selling, general and administrative expenses 21.9 22.1 22.1 Depreciation and amortization 2.5 2.5 2.5 Preopening expenses 0.3 0.3 0.4 Operating income 11.7 10.6 10.2 Interest expense 0.4 0.6 0.5 Interest income (0.1 ) 0.0 0.0 Income before income taxes 11.4 10.0 9.7 Provision for income taxes 4.3 3.7 3.7 Net income 7.1 % 6.3 % 6.0 % Net sales. Net sales, number of stores, sales growth, net sales per selling square foot and comparable store base for the last three fiscal years were as follows: Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Net sales (in thousands) $ 15,544,184 $ 13,402,217 $ 11,700,619 Number of stores open (end of period) 817 732 637 Sales growth all stores 16.0 % 14.5 % 13.8 % Sales growth comparable stores (a) 5.9 % 3.4 % 0.3 % Net sales per selling square foot (b) $ 256 $ 252 $ 255 Comparable store base 637 542 457 (a) Comparable store sales growth for each period is based on sales of stores (including e commerce sales, relocated or expanded stores) open throughout the full period and throughout the full prior period. Fiscal 2006 comparable store sales growth compares the 52 weeks ended January 27, 2007 to the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2006. (b) Net sales per selling square foot is calculated using net sales of stores that have been open for the full year divided by their square footage of selling space. The fiscal 2006 net sales per square foot calculation exclude the impact of the 53rd week. Net sales increased $2,142.0 million, or 16.0%, from $13,402.2 million in fiscal 2005 to $15,544.2 million in fiscal 2006. Net sales increased $1,209.0 million due to the opening of 85 new stores in fiscal 2006 and to the 15 Table of Contents inclusion of a full year of operating results for the 95 stores opened in fiscal 2005. Comparable store sales increased $736.2 million, or 5.9%, in fiscal 2006 and the remaining increase in net sales was due to the 53rd week. The comparable store sales increase was driven by a 3.8% increase in the number of transactions and a 2.1% increase in the average transaction value. All areas of the business had positive sales results with the Mens and Home businesses having the strongest sales performance. All regions had positive comparable sales increases. The Southwest region had the strongest comparable store sales performance. Net sales increased $1,701.6 million, or 14.5%, from $11,700.6 million in fiscal 2004 to $13,402.2 million in fiscal 2005. Net sales increased $1,336.4 million due to the opening of 95 new stores in fiscal 2005 and to the inclusion of a full year of operating results for the 95 stores opened in fiscal 2004. Comparable store sales increased $365.2 million, or 3.4%, in fiscal 2005. The Companys merchandise mix is reflected in the table below: Fiscal Year 2006 2005 2004 Womens 32.6 % 32.6 % 32.5 % Mens 18.8 % 18.6 % 18.5 % Home 18.5 % 18.4 % 18.5 % Childrens 12.9 % 13.0 % 13.4 % Accessories 9.1 % 9.2 % 9.0 % Footwear 8.1 % 8.2 % 8.1 % Gross margin. The Companys gross margin as a percent of net sales was 36.4% for fiscal 2006 compared to 35.5% for fiscal 2005. Gross margin increased $890.8 million from $4,762.9 million in fiscal 2005 to $5,653.7 million in fiscal 2006. Gross margin increased $434.0 million due to the opening of 85 new stores in fiscal 2006 and to the inclusion of a full year of operating results for the 95 stores opened in fiscal 2005. The comparable store gross margin increased $456.8 million. The improvement in gross margin was related to improvement in markup, inventory shortage, inventory management and better receipt flow across all store volume levels. Gross margin was also helped by increased penetration of private and exclusive brands. Private and exclusive brands increased to 34.5% of sales in fiscal 2006 from 30.0% last year. All lines of business experienced gross margin rate increases and the largest contributor to the gross margin rate increase was Womens. In addition, gross margin includes the effect of the Companys initial recognition of gift card breakage of $15.0 million in 2006. The Companys gross margin as a percent of net sales was 35.5% for fiscal 2005 compared to 35.2% for fiscal 2004. Gross margin increased $649.3 million from $4,113.6 million in fiscal 2004 to $4,762.9 million in fiscal 2005. Gross margin increased $459.0 million due to the opening of 95 new stores in fiscal 2005 and to the inclusion of a full year of operating results for the 95 stores opened in fiscal 2004. Comparable store gross margin increased $190.3 million due to improved gross margin on clearance sales, better merchandise content and improved inventory flow. The largest contributor to the gross margin rate increase was Womens. Selling, general and administrative expenses. S,G&A expenses include all direct store expenses such as payroll, occupancy and store supplies and all costs associated with the Companys distribution centers, advertising and corporate functions, but exclude depreciation and amortization. S,G&A expenses increased $437.9 million, or 14.8%, to $3,401.4 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $2,963.5 million in fiscal 2005. S,G&A expenses as a percent of net sales were 21.9% in fiscal 2006 compared to 22.1% in fiscal 2005. The Company achieved leverage in store operating expenses, credit costs and distribution center costs, offset by corporate and advertising expenses de leveraging for the year. The increase in corporate expenses was driven by the effects of the Companys stronger performance on incentive compensation expense. The increase in advertising expenses was driven by a shift in the mix of marketing toward more branding and direct mail. 16 Table of Contents S,G&A expenses increased $380.5 million, or 14.7%, to $2,963.5 million in fiscal 2005 compared to $2,583.0 million in fiscal 2004. S,G&A expenses as a percent of net sales was 22.1% in both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004. Store operating expenses increased 15.5%, which is consistent with the Companys square footage growth of 15.1%. The Company leveraged distribution expenses due to the increased productivity on a units per hour basis. The Company also leveraged credit expenses which were offset by increased corporate expenses as a percent of net sales. Depreciation and amortization. The total amount of depreciation and amortization increased from $338.9 million in fiscal 2005 to $387.7 million in fiscal 2006 due to the addition of new stores and the mix of owned compared to leased stores. Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales was 2.5% for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004. Preopening expenses. Preopening expenses are expensed as incurred and relate to the costs incurred prior to new store openings which includes advertising, hiring, and training costs for new employees, processing and transporting initial merchandise and rent expense. The average cost per store fluctuates based on the mix of stores opened in new markets compared to existing markets, with new markets being more expensive. The average cost to open the 85 new stores in fiscal 2006 was $580,000, the average cost to open the 95 new stores in fiscal 2005 was $481,000 and the average cost to open the 95 new stores in fiscal 2004 was $540,000. The increase in the average cost to open a store in fiscal 2006 is due to the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Position FAS 13 1, Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred during a Construction Period (FSP 13 1), as of January 29, 2006, which requires that rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases incurred during the construction period be recognized as rental expense. Prior to the adoption of FSP 13 1, the Company capitalized rental costs incurred during the construction period. The decrease in the average cost to open a store in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was due to the mix of stores opened in new markets compared to existing markets as well as entries made into less expensive markets. Interest expense. Net interest expense decreased $30.0 million from $70.4 million in fiscal 2005 to $40.4 million in fiscal 2006. The decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to an increase in interest income of $22.9 million, resulting from the interest earned on the investment of the proceeds received from the sale of the Companys private label credit card portfolio and higher interest rates on investments than last year. The decrease was also a result of less interest expense due to the retirement of $100.0 million of current debt during the first quarter of 2006. Net interest expense increased $7.9 million from $62.5 million in fiscal 2004 to $70.4 million in fiscal 2005. The increase is due to decreased capitalized interest due to less capital spending. Income taxes. The Companys effective tax rate was 37.5% in fiscal 2006, 37.4% in fiscal 2005 and 37.8% in fiscal 2004. The tax rate for fiscal 2006 benefited from the tax free interest earned on investments. The fiscal 2005 tax rate was a result of a $4.9 million tax adjustment due to the favorable resolution of certain state tax matters. Inflation The Company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations during the periods presented. However, there can be no assurance that the Companys business will not be affected by inflation in the future. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys primary ongoing cash requirements are for capital expenditures in connection with the expansion and remodeling programs and seasonal and new store inventory purchases. The Companys primary sources of funds for its business activities are cash flow provided by operations, short term trade credit and its lines of credit. 17 Table of Contents Operating activities. Cash flow provided by operations was $3,099.4 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $881.6 million in fiscal 2005, a $2,217.8 million increase. The primary source of cash flow provided by operations was the $1,652.1 million cash proceeds received in connection with the sale of the Companys proprietary credit card accounts on April 21, 2006. The primary use of cash flow was a $350.5 million increase in merchandise inventories which was partially offset by a $104.4 million increase in accounts payable. Cash flow provided by operations was $881.6 million in fiscal 2005 compared to $937.1 million in fiscal 2004, a decrease of $55.5 million. The primary uses of cash flow were provided by a $290.6 million increase in merchandise inventories and a $262.4 million increase in the accounts receivable portfolio. The primary sources of cash flow were a $125.3 million increase in accounts payable and a 19.7% increase in net income. Short term trade credit, in the form of extended payment terms for inventory purchases, represents a significant source of financing for merchandise inventories. Seasonal cash needs are met by the line of credit available under the Companys revolving credit facility. The Companys working capital and inventory levels typically build throughout the fall, peaking during the holiday selling season. Key financial ratios that provide certain measures of the Companys liquidity are as follows: February 3,2007 January 28,2006 January 29,2005 ($ In Thousands) Working capital $ 1,482,382 $ 2,519,642 $ 2,187,364 Current ratio 1.77:1 2.44:1 2.50:1 Debt / capitalization 15.9 % 16.2 % 18.0 % Earnings to fixed charges 7.61 6.35 5.83 The decrease in the Companys working capital and current ratio in fiscal 2006 is primarily due to the sale of the Companys private label credit card portfolio and the subsequent use of the proceeds to fund the $1.6 billion of share repurchases made during the year. The improvement in the debt / capitalization ratio in fiscal 2006 was due to the $1.6 billion of share repurchases made during the year and the retirement of $100.0 million of debt during the first quarter of 2006. The improvement in the earnings to fixed charges ratio was a result of the 31.7% increase in net income in fiscal 2006. At February 3, 2007, the Companys merchandise inventories increased $350.5 million to $2,588.1 million, an increase of 15.7% from the January 28, 2006 balance of $2,237.6 million. On an average store basis, the inventory at February 3, 2007 increased 3.6% compared to the inventory at January 28, 2006. Accounts payable increased $104.4 million to $934.4 million at February 3, 2007, from the January 28, 2006, balance of $830.0 million. Investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $1,419.3 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $903.7 million in fiscal 2005. Investing activities in 2006 included $1,142.2 million of capital expenditures and the net purchases of $270.2 million of short term investments. The purchase of short term investments represents the investment of excess proceeds received from the private label credit card transaction and the investment of additional free cash flow. Net cash used in investing activities was $903.7 million in fiscal 2005 compared to $977.5 million in fiscal 2004. Investing activities in 2005 included $828.1 million of capital expenditures compared to $919.0 million in 2004. Capital expenditures, including favorable lease rights, by major category are as follows: February 3, 2007 January 28, 2006 January 29, 2005 New Stores 75 % 74 % 76 % Remodels / Relocations 3 % 7 % 6 % Distribution Centers, Information Technology, and Other 22 % 19 % 18 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 18 Table of Contents The Company opened 85 new stores and one distribution center in fiscal 2006, and continued to make capital investments for information systems and other infrastructure to support the Companys growth. The increase in capital spending is a result of a shift in the store opening schedule to the fall season and the new distribution center in Patterson, California. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2007 are currently expected to be approximately $1.6 billion. Capital expenditures include costs for new store openings, store remodels and other base capital needs. The amount of capital expenditures fluctuates primarily as a result of the timing of new store capital spending, the mix of owned, leased and acquired stores, the number of stores remodeled and the timing of opening distribution centers. The expected increase in fiscal 2007 is due to opening 25 30 additional stores, more of which are owned, 24 additional remodels and investments in information systems. In addition, the Company expects a more balanced store opening schedule between the spring and fall seasons in fiscal 2008, resulting in more capital spending on those stores in fiscal 2007. The Company does not anticipate that its planned expansion will be limited by any restrictive covenants in its financing agreements. The Companys capital structure is well positioned to support its expansion plans. The Company anticipates that internally generated cash flows will be the primary source of funding for future growth. Financing activities. The Company anticipates that it will be able to satisfy its working capital requirements, planned capital expenditures and debt service requirements with available cash and short term investments, proceeds from cash flows from operations, short term trade credit, seasonal borrowings under its revolving credit facility and other sources of financing. The Company expects to generate adequate cash flow from operating activities to sustain current levels of operations. The Company maintained the following credit ratings as of March 20, 2007: Credit Ratings Moodys Standard & Poors Fitch Long term debt A3 BBB+ A On October 12, 2006, the Company entered into a new $900.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement (revolver). This agreement replaced the $532.0 million unsecured revolving bank credit facility (previous revolver) which would have matured on July 10, 2007. Depending on the type of advance under these facilities, amounts borrowed bear interest at competitive bid rates; LIBOR plus a margin based on the Companys long term unsecured debt rating; or the agent banks base rate. No amounts were outstanding under the revolver as of February 3, 2007. No amounts were outstanding under the previous revolver as of January 28, 2006. The Company also had a Receivable Purchase Agreement (RPA) which was terminated in the first quarter of 2006 in conjunction with the sale of the Companys private label credit card receivables. No amounts were outstanding as of January 28, 2006. Outlook The success the Company achieved over the last year was due to the consistent comparable and total sales growth, across all lines of business and regions, each and every quarter. The Company saw improvement in every major line of the income statement and significantly increased its cash flow for the year while returning cash to its shareholders through its share repurchase program. The Company will continue to build on this momentum in 2007 with the introduction of new brands, the continued rollout of its new innovation store format, continued focus on inventory management and continued 19 Table of Contents investment in marketing. The opportunity to continue to increase market share as well as introduce its customers to new areas of the store is great. With these initiatives, the Company believes it can continue to achieve industry leading comparable store sales increases. The Company is working further ahead in site selection, which should create better balance in its store opening schedule between the spring and fall seasons beginning in fiscal 2008. The Company is obtaining high quality sites that should allow it to continue to earn healthy returns on its investment and reach its goal of operating 1,200 stores by 2010. The Company also achieved a new all time high and industry leading operating margin of 11.7% in 2006. Through continued investment in talent and technology, the Company should continue to improve this metric in the coming years and stay ahead of its competition. For fiscal 2007, the Company expects a total sales increase of 9% to 11%, a comparable store sales increase of 2% to 4%, a gross margin rate increase of 30 to 40 basis points and to achieve SG&A leverage at a 2% comparable store sales increase. Achieving these assumptions would result in earnings per diluted share of $3.68 to $3.84 for the year. Contractual Obligations The Company has aggregate contractual obligations of $14,295.5 million related to debt repayments, capital leases, operating leases, royalties and purchase obligations as of February 3, 2007, as follows: Fiscal Year 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (In Thousands) Long term debt (a) $ 58,793 $ 58,775 $ 58,775 $ 58,775 $ 449,325 $ 1,301,850 $ 1,986,293 Capital leases (a) 31,070 23,150 21,678 18,540 17,835 207,100 319,373 Operating leases 369,966 375,563 370,070 363,529 361,869 6,976,862 8,817,859 Royalties Purchase obligations (b) 18,2333,001,793 26,616442 31,092 36,118 19,082 18,395 149,5363,002,235 Other (c) 19,049 930 238 20,217 Total $ 3,498,904 $ 485,476 $ 481,853 $ 476,962 $ 848,111 $ 8,504,207 $ 14,295,513 (a) Annual commitments on long term debt and capital leases are inclusive of related interest costs which total $1,090.4 million and $135.0 million, respectively. Also included in capital leases above are $21.3 million of lease obligations related to stores to be opened in 2007 and 2008. (b) The Companys purchase obligations consist mainly of purchase orders for merchandise. Amounts committed under open purchase orders for merchandise are cancelable without penalty prior to a date that precedes the vendors scheduled shipment date. (c) The other category above primarily includes commitments for stores to be opened in fiscal 2007 and 2008. The Company also has outstanding letters of credit and stand by letters of credit that total approximately $41.0 million at February 3, 2007. If certain conditions were met under these arrangements, the Company would be required to satisfy the obligations in cash. Due to the nature of these arrangements and based on historical experience, the Company does not expect to make any significant payments. Therefore, they have been excluded from the preceding table. 20 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has not provided any financial guarantees as of February 3, 2007. The Company has not created, and is not party to, any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating the Companys business. The Company does not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect the Companys liquidity or the availability of capital resources. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. A discussion of the more significant estimates follows. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Retail Inventory Method and Inventory Valuation The Company values its inventory at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on the first in, first out (FIFO) basis using the retail inventory method (RIM). Under RIM, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail value inventories. RIM is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality. The use of the retail inventory method will result in inventories being valued at the lower of cost or market as markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories. Based on a review of historical clearance markdowns, current business trends, expected vendor funding and discontinued merchandise categories, an adjustment to inventory is recorded to reflect additional markdowns which are estimated to be necessary to liquidate existing clearance inventories and reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market. Management believes that the Companys inventory valuation approximates the net realizable value of clearance inventory and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market. Vendor Allowances The Company records vendor allowances and discounts in the income statement when the purpose for which those monies were designated is fulfilled. Allowances provided by vendors generally relate to profitability of inventory recently sold and, accordingly, are reflected as reductions to cost of merchandise sold as negotiated. Vendor allowances received for advertising or fixture programs reduce the Companys expense or expenditure for the related advertising or fixture program when appropriate. Vendor allowances will fluctuate based on the amount of promotional and clearance markdowns necessary to liquidate the inventory. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, Business and Summary of Accounting Policies. Insurance Reserve Estimates The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation, general liability and employee related health care benefits, a portion of which is paid by its associates. The Company determines the estimates for the liabilities associated with these risks by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. A change in claims frequency and severity of claims from historical experience as well as changes in state statutes and the mix of states in which the Company operates could result in a change to the required reserve levels. Under its workers compensation and general liability insurance policies, the Company retains the initial risk of $500,000 and $250,000, respectively, per occurrence. The Company also has a lifetime medical payment limit of $1.5 million. 21 Table of Contents Impairment of Assets and Closed Store Reserves The Company has a significant investment in property and equipment and favorable lease rights. The related depreciation and amortization is computed using estimated useful lives of up to 50 years. The Company reviews whether indicators of impairment of long lived assets held for use (including favorable lease rights) are present annually or whenever an event, such as decisions to close a store, indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The Company has historically not experienced any significant impairment of long lived assets or closed store reserves. Decisions to close a store can also result in accelerated depreciation over the revised useful life. If the store is leased, a reserve is set up for the discounted difference between the rent and the expected sublease rental income when the location is no longer in use. A significant change in cash flows, market valuation, demand for real estate or other factors, could result in an increase or decrease in the reserve requirement or impairment charge. Income Taxes The Company pays income taxes based on tax statutes, regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which it operates. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various taxing authorities. The Companys effective income tax rate was 37.5% in fiscal 2006, 37.4% in fiscal 2005 and 37.8% in fiscal 2004. The effective rate is impacted by changes in law, location of new stores, level of earnings and the result of tax audits. Operating Leases The Company leases retail stores under operating leases. Many lease agreements contain rent holidays, rent escalation clauses and or contingent rent provisions. The Company recognizes rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term, including cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty. The Company uses a time period for its straight line rent expense calculation that equals or exceeds the time period used for depreciation. In addition, the commencement date of the lease term is the earlier of the date when the Company becomes legally obligated for the rent payments or the date when the Company takes possession of the land or the building for initial setup of fixtures and merchandise. New Accounting Pronouncements In October 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position FAS 13 1, Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred during a Construction Period (FSP 13 1). FSP 13 1 requires that rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during the construction period be recognized as rental expense. FSP 13 1 is applicable for the first reporting period after December 15, 2005. The Company has historically capitalized rental costs incurred during a construction period and the adoption of this guidance negatively impacted net income per share by approximately $0.03 in fiscal 2006. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. Under FIN 48, a tax position is not recognized until it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. Measurement of the tax position is based on the largest amount, determined on a cumulative probability basis that it is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company does not expect that this interpretation will have a material impact on the Companys consolidated net earnings, cash flows or financial position. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 (SAB 108), Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in 22 Table of Contents the Current Year Financial Statements. SAB 108 addresses quantifying financial statement misstatements, specifically, how the effects of prior year errors should be treated when quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements. SAB 108 provides transition guidance for correcting errors existing in prior years by allowing a one time correction for prior period misstatements that were uncorrected as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. SAB 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. The Company adopted SAB 108 as of February 3, 2007, with no impact on the Companys net earnings, cash flows or financial position. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Companys primary exposure to market risk consists of changes in interest rates or borrowings. At February 3, 2007 and January, 28, 2006, the Companys long term debt, excluding capital leases, was $895.8 million and $996.7 million, respectively, all of which is fixed rate debt. Long term fixed rate debt is utilized as a primary source of capital. When these debt instruments mature, the Company may refinance such debt at then existing market interest rates, which may be more or less than interest rates on the maturing debt. If interest rates on the existing fixed rate debt outstanding at February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006 changed by 100 basis points, the Companys annual interest expense would change by $9.0 million at February 3, 2007 and $10.0 million at January 28, 2006. During fiscal 2006, average borrowings under the Companys variable rate revolving credit facilities were $19.0 million. During fiscal 2005, the Companys average borrowings under the variable rate revolving credit facilities and the short term financing of its proprietary accounts receivable were $79.0 million. If interest rates on the average fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 variable rate debt changed by 100 basis points, the Companys annual interest expense would change by $190,000 and $790,000, respectively, assuming comparable borrowing levels. During fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, the Company did not enter into any derivative financial instruments.
