Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary Total net sales for 2007 were $16.5 billion, a 5.6% increase over 2006. Comparable store sales decreased 0.8% as the result of a 1.4% decrease in the number of transactions per store, partially offset by a 0.6% increase in average transaction value. Accessories reported the strongest comparable store sales with strength in beauty and jewelry. The Northeast region led our comparable store sales for 2007. Net income for 2007 was $1.1 billion, or $3.39 per diluted share, compared with $1.1 billion or $3.31 per diluted share for 2006 and $0.8 billion, or $2.43 per diluted share, for 2005. In 2007, we successfully opened 112 new stores, including eight stores in both the Mid Atlantic and Northeast regions, 15 stores in the Midwest region, 17 stores in the Northwest region, 18 stores in the Southwest region, 21 stores in the South Central region and 25 stores in the Southeast region. As of year end 2007, we operated 929 stores in 47 states. Our capital structure is well positioned to continue to support our expansion plans. Internally generated cash flows will continue to be our primary source of the funding required for future growth. In addition, as of March 18, 2008, we had long term debt ratings of Baa1 by Moodys and BBB+ by both Standard and Poors and Fitch. On September 28, 2007, we issued $1 billion of long term debt, which included $650 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.25% Notes due 2017 and $350 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.875% Notes due 2037. Interest only payments are due on these notes semi annually on June 15 and December 15 beginning on June 15, 2008. The notes are subject to various customary covenants. We have used a portion of the proceeds and intend to use the remaining proceeds from this issuance for general corporate purposes, which will include funding our share repurchase program. We completed our $2 billion share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2007. Since announcing that program in April 2006, we purchased 32.8 million shares at an average price of approximately $61 per share. In September 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a new $2.5 billion share repurchase program which is intended to return excess capital to our shareholders. We expect to execute this share repurchase program primarily in open market transactions, subject to market conditions, and expect to complete the program by the end of fiscal 2010. Funding for the new program will be from operating cash flow as well as the proceeds from the notes issued in September 2007 and, therefore, is not expected to have a significant impact on our short or long term liquidity. During 2007, we repurchased a total of 12.7 million shares under both programs for approximately $745 million at an average price of $58.50 per share. For 2008, we expect a total sales increase of 5% 8%, comparable store sales decrease of 0 3% and a gross margin increase of 0 20 basis points. We also expect selling, general and administrative expenses to increase 9 10 percent for the year. Achieving these expectations would result in earnings per diluted share of $3.15 to $3.50 for the year. Results of Operations Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31. Unless otherwise noted, references to years in this report relate to fiscal years, rather than to calendar years. Fiscal year 2007 (2007) ended on February 2, 2008 and was a 52 week year. Fiscal year 2006 (2006) ended on February 3, 2007 and was a 53 week year. Fiscal year 2005 (2005) ended on January 28, 2006 and was a 52 week year. 17 Table of Contents Net sales. 2007 2006 2005 Net sales (in thousands) $ 16,473,734 $ 15,596,910 $ 13,444,397 Number of stores: Open at end of period 929 817 732 Comparable stores (a) 733 637 542 Sales growth: All stores 5.6 % 16.0 % 14.9 % Comparable stores (a) (0.8 %) 5.9 % 3.4 % Net sales per selling square foot (b) $ 249 $ 256 $ 252 (a) Comparable stores sales growth is based on sales for stores (including e commerce sales and relocated or expanded stores) which were open throughout both the full current and prior year periods. Fiscal 2006 was a 53 week year. Comparable store sales growth for 2006 is presented for the 52 weeks ended January 27, 2007 and excludes approximately $200 million in sales which were earned in the 53rd week of that year. (b) Net sales per selling square foot is based on comparable stores, excluding e commerce. Fiscal 2006 excludes the impact of the 53rd week. Net sales for 2007 increased $876.8 million, or 5.6%, over 2006. New stores contributed $998.4 million to the increase in net sales over the prior year. Comparable store sales decreased $121.6 million, or 0.8%, as the result of a 1.4% decrease in the number of transactions per store, partially offset by a 0.6% increase in average transaction value. We opened 112 new stores in 2007, 85 stores in 2006 and 95 stores in 2005. As we open new stores, especially in existing markets, sales may be taken away from existing stores. We estimate that opening new stores in existing markets negatively impacted comparable store sales by approximately 1% in 2007. From a line of business perspective, Accessories reported the strongest comparable store sales with strength in beauty and jewelry. Mens and Footwear outperformed the company for the year, while Womens and Home trailed the company. Childrens trend to the company improved substantially in the fourth quarter, however, finished the year still trailing the company. The Northeast region led our comparable store sales for 2007. E commerce sales increased 30.9% to $240.5 million for 2007 as we continue to expand the selections offered on line. For 2006, net sales increased $2.2 billion, or 16.0%, over 2005. Net sales increased $1.2 billion due to the opening of 85 new stores in 2006 and to the inclusion of a full year of operating results for the 95 stores opened in 2005. Comparable store sales increased $736.2 million, or 5.9%, in 2006 and the remaining increase in net sales was due to the 53rd week. The comparable store sales increase was driven by a 3.8% increase in the number of transactions and a 2.1% increase in the average transaction value. All areas of the business had positive sales results with the Mens and Home businesses having the strongest sales performance. All regions had positive comparable sales increases. The Southwest region had the strongest comparable store sales performance. Our merchandise mix has remained relatively constant over the last three years, as reflected in the table below: 2007 2006 2005 Womens 32.6 % 32.6 % 32.6 % Mens 18.8 18.8 18.6 Home 18.5 18.5 18.4 Childrens 12.7 12.9 13.0 Accessories 9.3 9.1 9.2 Footwear 8.1 8.1 8.2 18 Table of Contents Gross margin. 2007 2006 2005 (Dollars in Thousands) Gross margin $ 6,014,185 $ 5,674,837 $ 4,780,320 As a percent of net sales 36.5 % 36.4 % 35.6 % Gross margin includes the total cost of products sold, including product development costs, net of vendor payments other than reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs; inventory shrink; markdowns; freight expenses associated with moving merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers; shipping and handling expenses of e commerce sales and terms cash discount. Our gross margin may not be comparable with that of other retailers because we include distribution center costs in selling, general and administrative expenses while other retailers may include these expenses in cost of merchandise sold. Gross margin for 2007 increased $339.3 million, or 6.0%, over 2006. The improvement in gross margin as a percent of net sales for 2007 compared to 2006 was driven by the continued impact of our merchandise and inventory management initiatives, improved markup and shortage results, the adoption of our markdown optimization systems, and increased penetration of private and exclusive brands. Sales of private and exclusive brands reached 39.2% of net sales for 2007, an increase of over 300 basis points over 2006. Gross margin for 2006 increased $894.5 million over 2005. Gross margin increased $437.7 million due to the opening of 85 new stores in 2006 and to the inclusion of a full year of operating results for the 95 stores opened in 2005. Comparable store gross margin increased $456.8 million. The improvement in gross margin was related to improvement in markup, inventory shortage, inventory management and better receipt flow across all store volume levels. Gross margin was also helped by increased penetration of private and exclusive brands. Private and exclusive brands increased to 35.8% of sales for 2006 from 30.0% for 2005. All lines of business experienced gross margin rate increases and the largest contributor to the gross margin rate increase was Womens. In addition, gross margin includes the effect of our initial recognition of gift card breakage of $15.0 million in 2006. Selling, general and administrative expenses. 2007 2006 2005 (Dollars in Thousands) Selling, general, and administrative expenses $ 3,696,841 $ 3,422,600 $ 2,980,853 As a percent of net sales 22.4 % 21.9 % 22.2 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (S,G&A) include compensation and benefit costs (including stores, headquarters, buying and merchandising and distribution centers); occupancy and operating costs of our retail, distribution and corporate facilities; freight expenses associated with moving merchandise from our distribution centers to our retail stores, and among distribution and retail facilities; advertising expenses, offset by vendor payments for reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs; and other administrative costs. Depreciation and amortization and preopening expenses are not included in S,G&A. The classification of these expenses varies across the retail industry. Distribution center costs, which are included in S,G&A, totaled $189.5 million for 2007, $173.0 million for 2006 and $154.4 million for 2005. S,G&A for 2007 increased $274.2 million, or 8.0%, over 2006. Even though the increase in S,G&A was higher than the increase in sales, it was lower than new store growth of 13.8%. We achieved leverage in credit and corporate expenses for 2007, but stores, advertising and distribution centers did not leverage primarily due to lower sales, our desire to maintain a positive customer in store experience and incremental marketing expenses associated with the launch of new brand initiatives and new store openings. These increases were partially offset by lower incentive compensation expenses. 19 Table of Contents S,G&A for 2006 increased $441.7 million, or 14.8%, over 2005. We achieved leverage in store operating expenses, credit costs and distribution center costs, offset by corporate and advertising expenses de leveraging for the year. The increase in corporate expenses was driven by the effects of our stronger performance on incentive compensation expense. The increase in advertising expenses was driven by a shift in the mix of marketing toward more branding and direct mail. Depreciation and amortization. 2007 2006 2005 (Dollars in Thousands) Depreciation and amortization $ 452,145 $ 387,674 $ 338,916 As a percent of net sales 2.7 % 2.5 % 2.5 % The increases in depreciation and amortization are primarily due to the addition of new stores and the mix of owned compared to leased stores. The increase for 2007 over 2006 is also attributable to depreciation on remodels and our new point of sale system. Preopening expenses. 2007 2006 2005 (Dollars in Thousands) Preopening expenses $ 60,722 $ 49,762 $ 44,370 Number of stores opened 112 85 95 Average cost per store $ 497 $ 580 $ 481 Preopening expenses include the costs incurred prior to new store openings, such as advertising, hiring, and training costs for new employees, processing and transporting initial merchandise and rent expense. The average cost per store fluctuates based on the mix of stores opened in new markets compared to existing markets, with new markets being more expensive. The decrease in the average cost per store for 2007 compared to 2006 is due to shifting more advertising to the post grand opening period and to an increase in the percentage of stores which were opened in existing markets rather than new markets. The increase in the average cost per store in 2006 compared to 2005 was due to the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement which requires that rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases incurred during the construction period be recognized as rental expense rather than capitalized. Operating income. 2007 2006 2005 (Dollars in Thousands) Operating income $ 1,804,477 $ 1,814,801 $ 1,416,181 As a percent of net sales 11.0 % 11.6 % 10.5 % The changes in operating income and operating income as a percent of net sales are due to the factors discussed above. Interest expense. 2007 2006 2005 (Dollars in Thousands) Interest expense, net $ 62,416 $ 40,356 $ 70,391 20 Table of Contents Net interest expense for 2007 increased $22.1 million, or 54.7%, over 2006 primarily due to higher outstanding debt balances, including both advances on our short term credit facilities and $1 billion in new debt that was issued in September 2007. Lower interest income on investments also contributed to the increase as we used proceeds from the 2007 debt issuance and the 2006 sale of our credit card portfolio to fund stock repurchases. These increases were partially offset by higher capitalized interest due to increased capital expenditures. Net interest expense for 2006 decreased $30.0 million, or 42.7%, compared to 2005 primarily due to an increase in interest income of $22.9 million resulting from the interest earned on the investment of the proceeds received from the sale of our private label credit card portfolio and higher interest rates on investments. The decrease was also a result of lower interest expense due to the retirement of $100 million of current debt during the first quarter of 2006. Income taxes. 2007 2006 2005 (Dollars in Thousands) Provision for income taxes $ 658,210 $ 665,764 $ 503,830 Effective tax rate 37.8 % 37.5 % 37.4 % The increase in the effective tax rate for 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to a decrease in the amount of tax exempt interest earned in 2007 compared to 2006 and a shift in the mix of new stores in certain jurisdictions. The tax rate for 2006 benefited from the tax free interest earned on investments. The 2005 tax rate was a result of a $4.9 million tax adjustment due to the favorable resolution of certain state tax matters. Inflation We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations during the periods presented. However, there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary ongoing cash requirements are for capital expenditures in connection with our expansion and remodeling programs and seasonal and new store inventory purchases. Our primary sources of funds are cash flow provided by operations, short term trade credit and our lines of credit. Short term trade credit, in the form of extended payment terms for inventory purchases, represents a significant source of financing for merchandise inventories. Seasonal cash needs are met by the line of credit available under our revolving credit facility. Our working capital and inventory levels typically build throughout the fall, peaking during the November and December holiday selling season. We anticipate that we will be able to satisfy our working capital requirements, planned capital expenditures and debt service requirements with available cash and short term investments, proceeds from cash flows from operations, short term trade credit, seasonal borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other sources of financing. We expect to generate adequate cash flow from operating activities to sustain current levels of operations. 2007 2006 2005 (Dollars in Thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,234,363 $ 3,120,223 $ 908,115 Investing activities (1,567,771 ) (1,440,181 ) (930,207 ) Financing activities 324,781 (1,617,711 ) 32,214 21 Table of Contents Operating activities. The $1.9 billion decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to the cash proceeds of $1.6 billion received in April 2006 in conjunction with the sale of our proprietary credit card portfolio. The primary use of operating cash flow for 2007 was an increase in merchandise inventories of $275.0 million. The primary source of operating cash flow for 2007 was a $148.7 million increase in accrued and other long term liabilities. Accounts payable was a $98.4 million use of operating cashflow in 2007, compared to a $104.4 million source of operating cashflow in 2006. Merchandise inventories used cash of $275.0 million in 2007. The 10.8% increase in our ending inventory balance from year end 2006 to 2007 was primarily due to the increase in the number of stores. On an average per store basis, merchandise inventories at year end 2007 decreased 2.6% from year end 2006, due to conservative receipt plans for Spring 2008. Accounts payable at year end 2007 decreased $98.4 million from year end 2006. Accounts payable as a percent of inventory was 29.3% at year end 2007, compared to 36.2% at year end 2006, reflecting reduced receipts of Spring 2008 merchandise as a result of conservative sales planning and increased vendor allowances. Net cash flow provided by operations for 2006 increased $2.2 billion over 2005. The primary source of cash flow provided by operations was the $1.6 billion cash proceeds received in connection with the sale of our proprietary credit card accounts on April 21, 2006. The primary use of cash flow was a $349.7 million increase in merchandise inventories which was partially offset by a $104.4 million increase in accounts payable. Key financial ratios that provide certain measures of our liquidity are as follows: 2007 2006 2005 Working capital (In Thousands) $ 1,952,441 $ 1,482,382 $ 2,519,642 Current ratio 2.1:1 1.78:1 2.45:1 Debt / capitalization 25.3 % 15.9 % 16.2 % Ratio of earnings to fixed charges 5.97 7.61 6.35 The increase in working capital and the current ratio as of year end 2007 compared to year end 2006 was primarily due to higher inventories and short term investments and decreases in accounts payable and taxes payable. The increase in the debt/capitalization ratio represents higher debt levels, partially offset by higher capitalization. The higher debt levels reflect the $1 billion of long term notes that were issued in September 2007. The higher capitalization is the result of earnings and stock option exercises, partially offset by share repurchases. The decrease in the earnings to fixed charges ratio was the result of lower income before taxes, including higher interest expense on our debt and higher rent expense attributable to interest. The decrease in our working capital and current ratio at year end 2006 compared to year end 2005 was primarily due to the sale of our private label credit card portfolio and the subsequent use of the proceeds to fund the $1.6 billion of share repurchases made during 2006. The improvement in the debt/capitalization ratio at year end 2006 was due to the $1.6 billion of share repurchases made during the year and the retirement of $100 million of debt during the first quarter of 2006. The improvement in the earnings to fixed charges ratio was a result of the increase in income before taxes in 2006. Investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities increased $127.6 million for 2007 compared to 2006. The increase reflects higher capital expenditures, partially offset by the net impact of short term investing activities. Net short term investment activity resulted in a use of funds of $51.9 million in 2007 and $270.2 million in 2006. Net short term investment activity reflects investment funds used to purchase treasury stock and the investment of proceeds from the $1 billion of new debt issued in September 2007 and the sale of our private label credit card portfolio in 2006. 22 Table of Contents Capital expenditures include costs for new store openings, store remodels and relocations, distribution center openings, information technology and other capital needs. Capital expenditures totaled $1.5 billion for 2007, a $378.6 million increase over 2006 primarily due to an increase in the number of stores opened and an increase in the number of remodels. Capital expenditures, including favorable lease rights, by major category were as follows: 2007 2006 2005 New stores 77 % 76 % 74 % Remodels / relocations 6 2 7 Distribution centers 3 6 4 Other 14 16 15 Acquisition of property and equipment and favorable lease rights 100 % 100 % 100 % Total capital expenditures for 2008 are currently expected to be approximately $1.2 $1.3 billion. The actual amount of future annual capital expenditures will depend primarily on the number of new stores opened, the mix of owned, leased or acquired stores, and the number of stores remodeled. We do not anticipate that our expansion plans will be limited by any restrictive covenants in our financing agreements. We believe that our capital structure is well positioned to support our expansion plans. We anticipate that internally generated cash flows will be the primary source of funding for future growth. As of February 2, 2008, we held $447.2 million in auction rate securities (ARS) which are classified as short term investments. ARS are long term debt instruments with interest rates reset through periodic short term auctions. If there are insufficient buyers, then the auction fails and holders are unable to liquidate their investment through the auction. A failed auction is not a default of the debt instrument, but does set a new interest rate in accordance with the original terms of the debt instrument. A failed auction limits liquidity for holders until there is a successful auction or until such time as another market for ARS develops. ARS are generally callable at any time by the issuer. Scheduled auctions continue to be held until the ARS matures or until it is called. Subsequent to February 2, 2008, we sold five ARS issues, at a total par value of $75.5 million and acquired three ARS issues with a total par value of $52.8 million. From February 11 through March 18, 2008, all of the auctions that were held for ARS in our portfolio failed. Our ARS portfolio consists entirely of AAA rated, insured student loan backed securities. Approximately 95% of the principal and interest is insured by the federal government and the remainder is insured by AAA rated insurance companies. At this time, we have no reason to believe that any of the underlying issuers of our ARS or their insurers are presently at risk or that the underlying credit quality of the assets backing our ARS investments has been impacted by the reduced liquidity of these investments. Additionally, we believe that the current lack of liquidity relating to our ARS investments will have no impact on our ability to fund our ongoing operations and growth initiatives. We will continue to monitor these investments for any possible balance sheet reclassification or potential impairment charges. Net cash used in our investing activities for 2006 increased $510.0 million over 2005. Investing activities in 2006 included $1.2 billion of capital expenditures and net purchases of $270.2 million of short term investments. The purchase of short term investments represents the investment of the excess proceeds received from the sale of our private label credit card portfolio and the investment of additional free cash flow. Financing activities. Our financing activities generated $324.8 million of cash in 2007, compared to using $1.6 billion in 2006. The change is the result of proceeds from the issuance of notes in 2007 and lower treasury stock purchases. On September 28, 2007, we issued $1 billion of long term debt, which included $650 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.25% Notes due 2017 and $350 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.875% 23 Table of Contents Notes due 2037. Interest only payments are due on these notes semi annually on June 15 and December 15 beginning on June 15, 2008. The notes are subject to various customary covenants. We have used a portion of the proceeds and intend to use the remaining proceeds from this issuance for general corporate purposes, which will include funding our share repurchase program. We have various facilities upon which we may draw funds. As of year end 2007, these facilities included a $900 million senior unsecured revolving facility and two demand notes with availability of $50 million. No amounts were outstanding under our short term credit facilities at year end 2007 or 2006. Weighted average borrowings under revolving facilities were $62.7 million for 2007, $19.0 million for 2006 and $79.0 million for 2005. During the second quarter of 2007, we completed our $2 billion share repurchase program, which was announced in March 2006. The share repurchase program was executed in open market transactions. In September 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a new $2.5 billion share repurchase program which is intended to return excess capital to our shareholders. We expect to execute this share repurchase program primarily in open market transactions, subject to market conditions, and expect to complete the program by the end of fiscal 2010. Funding for the new program will be from operating cash flow as well as the $1 billion in long term debt financing issued in September 2007 and, therefore, is not expected to have a significant impact on our short or long term liquidity. Total repurchases under the repurchase plans were as follows: 2007 2006 Total (In thousands, except per share amounts) $2 Billion Program: Shares 5,334 27,466 32,800 Cost $ 373,230 $ 1,626,669 $ 1,999,899 Cost Per Share $ 69.97 $ 59.22 $ 60.97 $2.5 Billion Program: Shares 7,409 7,409 Cost $ 372,231 $ 372,231 Cost Per Share $ 50.24 $ 50.24 Total: Shares 12,743 27,466 40,209 Cost $ 745,461 $ 1,626,669 $ 2,372,130 Cost Per Share $ 58.50 $ 59.22 $ 59.00 We also acquire shares from employees in lieu of amounts required to satisfy minimum tax withholding requirements upon the vesting of the employees restricted stock. Such shares are then designated as treasury shares. Our credit ratings were reduced in conjunction with the $1 billion in debt that we issued in September 2007. Our ratings are currently as follows: Credit Ratings Moodys Standard & Poors Fitch Long term debt Baa1 BBB+ BBB+ On October 12, 2006, we entered into a $900.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement (revolver). This agreement replaced the $532.0 million unsecured revolving bank credit facility, which would have matured on July 10, 2007. Depending on the type of advance under these facilities, amounts borrowed bear interest at competitive bid rates; LIBOR plus a margin, depending on our long term unsecured debt ratings; or the agent banks base rate. No amounts were outstanding under the revolver as of February 2, 2008. 24 Table of Contents Our financing activities used cash of $1.6 billion in 2006 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $32.2 million in 2005. In 2006, we used proceeds from the sale of our private label credit card portfolio to purchase $1.6 billion of our stock. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations as of February 2, 2008 are as follows: Total Less Than 1Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5Years (In Thousands) Recorded contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 1,900,000 $ $ $ 400,000 $ 1,500,000 Capital leases 172,385 12,701 21,835 16,665 121,184 Other (a) 16,972 16,734 238 2,089,357 29,435 22,073 416,665 1,621,184 Unrecorded contractual obligations: Interest payments: Long term debt 2,162,086 137,298 246,926 213,273 1,564,589 Capital leases 121,538 12,474 22,494 19,534 67,036 Operating leases (b) 9,446,532 410,735 818,278 787,678 7,429,841 Royalties 181,359 31,686 82,932 52,403 14,338 Purchase obligations (c) 2,764,738 2,764,723 15 14,676,253 3,356,916 1,170,645 1,072,888 9,075,804 Total $ 16,765,610 $ 3,386,351 $ 1,192,718 $ 1,489,553 $ 10,696,988 (a) Other includes primarily commitments for stores to be opened in 2008 and 2009. (b) Our leases typically require that we pay real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs in addition to the minimum rental payments included in the table above. Such costs vary from period to period and totaled $135.0 million for 2007, $122.9 million for 2006 and $108.7 million for 2005. (c) Our purchase obligations consist mainly of purchase orders for merchandise. Amounts committed under open purchase orders for merchandise are cancelable without penalty prior to a date that precedes the vendors scheduled shipment date. We also have outstanding letters of credit and stand by letters of credit that total approximately $37.8 million at February 2, 2008. If certain conditions were met under these arrangements, we would be required to satisfy the obligations in cash. Due to the nature of these arrangements and based on historical experience, we do not expect to make any significant payments under these arrangements. Therefore, they have been excluded from the preceding table. We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on February 4, 2007. It is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax positions may change within the next 12 months, primarily as a result of ongoing audits. While it is possible that one or more of these examinations may be resolved in the next year, it is not anticipated that payment of any such amounts in future periods will affect liquidity and cash flows. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not provided any financial guarantees as of year end 2007. We have not created, and are not party to, any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating our business. We do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources. 25 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. A discussion of the more significant estimates follows. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Retail Inventory Method and Inventory Valuation We value our inventory at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on the first in, first out (FIFO) basis using the retail inventory method (RIM). RIM is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality. Under RIM, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail value of the inventories. The use of RIM will result in inventories being valued at the lower of cost or market as markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories. Based on a review of historical clearance markdowns, current business trends, expected vendor funding and discontinued merchandise categories, an adjustment to inventory is recorded to reflect additional markdowns which are estimated to be necessary to liquidate existing clearance inventories and reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market. Management believes that our inventory valuation approximates the net realizable value of clearance inventory and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market. Vendor Allowances We record vendor allowances and discounts in the income statement when the purpose for which those monies were designated is fulfilled. Allowances provided by vendors generally relate to profitability of inventory recently sold and, accordingly, are reflected as reductions to cost of merchandise sold as negotiated. Vendor allowances received for advertising or fixture programs reduce our expense or expenditure for the related advertising or fixture program when appropriate. Vendor allowances will fluctuate based on the amount of promotional and clearance markdowns necessary to liquidate the inventory. See also Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, Business and Summary of Accounting Policies. Insurance Reserve Estimates We use a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation, general liability and employee related health care benefits, a portion of which is paid by our associates. We use a third party actuary, which considers historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions, to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks. A change in claims frequency and severity of claims from historical experience as well as changes in state statutes and the mix of states in which we operate could result in a change to the required reserve levels. We retain the initial risk of $500,000 per occurrence under our workers compensation insurance policy and $250,000 per occurrence under our general liability policy. We also have a lifetime medical payment limit of $1.5 million. Impairment of Assets and Closed Store Reserves We have a significant investment in property and equipment and favorable lease rights. The related depreciation and amortization is computed using estimated useful lives of up to 50 years. We review our long lived assets held for use (including favorable lease rights) for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances, such as decisions to close a store, indicates the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. We have historically not experienced any significant impairment of long lived assets or closed store reserves. Decisions to close a store can also result in accelerated depreciation over the revised useful life. When operations at a leased store are discontinued, a reserve is established for the discounted difference between the rent and the expected sublease rental income. A significant change in cash flows, market valuation, demand for real estate or other factors, could result in an increase or decrease in the reserve requirement or impairment charge. 26 Table of Contents Income Taxes We pay income taxes based on tax statutes, regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various taxing authorities. Our effective income tax rate was 37.8% in 2007, 37.5% in 2006 and 37.4% in 2005. The effective rate is impacted by changes in law, location of new stores, level of earnings and the result of tax audits. Operating Leases As of February 2, 2008, we leased 602 of our 929 retail stores. Many lease agreements contain rent holidays, rent escalation clauses and or contingent rent provisions. We recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term, including cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty. We use a time period for our straight line rent expense calculation that equals or exceeds the time period used for depreciation. In addition, the commencement date of the lease term is the earlier of the date when we become legally obligated for the rent payments or the date when we take possession of the building or land for initial setup of fixtures and merchandise or land improvements. New Accounting Pronouncements On December 4, 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Statement No. 141 (Revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141(R)). SFAS 141(R) will significantly change the accounting for business combinations. We will need to apply the provisions of SFAS 141(R) to any business combination with an acquisition date after January 31, 2009. Earlier adoption is prohibited. As we typically acquire single properties rather than businesses, we do not expect the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial statements. The FASB has also released two statements which address fair value accounting. FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. FASB Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS 159), permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. Portions of both statements are effective for our fiscal 2008. The remaining portions of both statements are effective for our fiscal 2009. We do not expect the adoption of either of these statements will have a material impact on our financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk All of our long term debt at year end 2007 is at fixed interest rates and, therefore, is not affected by changes in interest rates. When our long term debt instruments mature, we may refinance them at then existing market interest rates, which may be more or less than interest rates on the maturing debt. Borrowings under our revolving credit facilities are at variable rates and are affected by changes in interest rates. For 2007, average borrowings under our revolving credit facilities were $62.7 million. If interest rates on the average 2007 variable rate debt changed by 100 basis points, our annual interest expense would change by $627,000, assuming comparable borrowing levels. We were not a party to any derivative financial instruments in 2007, 2006 or 2005.
