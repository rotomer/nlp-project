Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary Our 2008 net sales reflect the impact of reduced discretionary consumer spending as a result of the slowdown in the U.S. economy. Partially offsetting the decrease in comparable store sales were the positive results of strong inventory and expense management. Total net sales for 2008 were $16 billion, a 0.5% decrease from 2007. Comparable store sales decreased 6.9% as the result of a 5.9% decrease in the number of transactions per store and a 1.0% decrease in average transaction value. Accessories reported the strongest comparable store sales. The Northeast, Midwest and Mid Atlantic regions had the strongest comparable store sales for 2008. Gross margin as a percent of net sales was 36.9% for 2008, a 44 basis point improvement over 2007. Conservative inventory management, lower levels of clearance inventory, and increased penetration of private and exclusive brands contributed to the margin strength, despite the difficult economic environment. Inventory per store at year end 2008 decreased 9.3% compared to year end 2007. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 6.5% over 2007. As expected, these expenses increased more than sales, but less than new store growth of 8.1%. Net income for 2008 was $885 million, or $2.89 per diluted share, compared with $1.1 billion or $3.39 per diluted share for 2007. As of year end 2008, we operated 1,004 stores, with 75 million square feet of selling space, in 48 states compared to 929 stores, with 70 million square feet of selling space, in 47 states as of year end 2007. In 2009, we are planning to open approximately 55 new stores. We are also planning to remodel 51 stores, an increase from 36 remodels in 2008. We believe our capital structure is well positioned to continue to support our expansion plans. We expect internally generated cash flows to continue to be our primary source of the funding required for future growth. For 2009, we currently expect total sales to decrease in the range of 4% to 1% and comparable store sales to decrease in the range of 8% to 5% compared to 2008. We currently expect gross margin as a percentage of sales to be flat to up 10 basis points over 2008 and SG&A expense to increase 3% to 4% over 2008. Achieving these expectations would result in earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.00 to $2.30 for fiscal 2009. Results of Operations Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31. Unless otherwise noted, references to years in this report relate to fiscal years, rather than to calendar years. Fiscal year 2008 (2008) ended on January 31, 2009 and was a 52 week year. Fiscal year 2007 (2007) ended on February 2, 2008 and was a 52 week year. Fiscal year 2006 (2006) ended on February 3, 2007 and was a 53 week year. 19 Table of Contents Net sales. 2008 2007 2006 Net sales (in millions) $ 16,389 $ 16,474 $ 15,597 Number of stores: Open at end of period 1,004 929 817 Comparable stores (a) 817 732 637 Sales growth: All stores (0.5 %) 5.6 % 16.0 % Comparable stores (a) (6.9 %) (0.8 %) 5.9 % Net sales per selling square foot (b) $ 222 $ 249 $ 256 (a) Comparable stores sales growth is based on sales for stores (including e commerce sales and relocated or expanded stores) which were open throughout both the full current and prior year periods. Fiscal 2006 was a 53 week year. Comparable store sales growth for 2006 is presented for the 52 weeks ended January 27, 2007 and excludes approximately $200 million in sales which were earned in the 53rd week of that year. (b) Net sales per selling square foot is based on stores open for the full current period, excluding e commerce. Fiscal 2006 excludes the impact of the 53rd week. Net sales for 2008 decreased $85 million, or 0.5%, from 2007. New stores contributed $1.0 billion to the increase in net sales over the prior year. Comparable store sales decreased $1.1 billion, or 6.9%, as the result of a 5.9% decrease in the number of transactions per store and a 1.0% decrease in average transaction value. We opened 75 new stores in 2008, 112 stores in 2007 and 85 stores in 2006. As we open new stores, especially in existing markets, sales may be transfered from existing stores. We estimate that opening new stores in existing markets negatively impacted comparable store sales by approximately 1% in 2008. From a line of business perspective, Accessories reported the strongest comparable store sales with strength in sterling silver jewelry and accessories/handbags. Childrens, Mens and Footwear outperformed the companys comparable store sales for the year, while Womens and Home trailed the company. The Northeast, Midwest and Mid Atlantic regions reported the strongest comparable store sales for 2008. E commerce revenues increased 48% to $356 million for 2008 as we continue to expand the selections offered on line. Net sales per selling square foot decreased 11% to $222 in 2008. The decrease is primarily due to the decrease in comparable store sales. The remaining decrease is attributable to the percentage of stores opened in southern regions in 2007. The southern regions have been impacted more by the economic downturn than other regions. Net sales for 2007 increased $877 million, or 5.6%, over 2006. New stores contributed $998 million to the increase in net sales over the prior year. Comparable store sales decreased $121 million, or 0.8%, as the result of a 1.4% decrease in the number of transactions per store, partially offset by a 0.6% increase in average transaction value. From a line of business perspective, Accessories reported the strongest comparable store sales in 2007 with strength in beauty and jewelry. Mens and Footwear outperformed the company for the year, while Womens and Home trailed the company. The Northeast region led our comparable store sales for 2007. E commerce revenues increased 31% to $241 million for 2007 as we continued to expand the selections offered on line. As reflected in the table below, our merchandise mix has remained relatively constant over the last three years: 2008 2007 2006 Womens 32 % 33 % 33 % Mens 19 19 19 Home 18 18 18 Childrens 13 13 13 Accessories 10 9 9 Footwear 8 8 8 20 Table of Contents Gross margin. 2008 2007 2006 (Dollars in millions) Gross margin $ 6,055 $ 6,014 $ 5,675 As a percent of net sales 36.9 % 36.5 % 36.4 % Gross margin includes the total cost of products sold, including product development costs, net of vendor payments other than reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs; inventory shrink; markdowns; freight expenses associated with moving merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers; shipping and handling expenses of e commerce sales; and terms cash discount. Our gross margin may not be comparable with that of other retailers because we include distribution center costs in selling, general and administrative expenses while other retailers may include these expenses in cost of merchandise sold. The net $41 million, or 0.7%, increase in gross margin dollars for 2008 compared to 2007 reflects incremental sales at newly opened stores, substantially offset by decreases at comparable stores. The improvement in gross margin as a percent of net sales for 2008 compared to 2007 was driven by the continued impact of our merchandise and inventory management initiatives and increased penetration of private and exclusive brands. Sales of private and exclusive brands reached approximately 42% of net sales for 2008, an increase of over 260 basis points over 2007. Gross margin for 2007 increased $339 million, or 6.0%, over 2006. The improvement in gross margin as a percent of net sales for 2007 compared to 2006 was driven by the continued impact of our merchandise and inventory management initiatives, improved markup and shortage results, the adoption of our markdown optimization systems, and increased penetration of private and exclusive brands. Sales of private and exclusive brands were approximately 39% of net sales for 2007, an increase of over 300 basis points over 2006. Selling, general and administrative expenses. 2008 2007 2006 (Dollars in millions) Selling, general, and administrative expenses $ 3,936 $ 3,697 $ 3,422 As a percent of net sales 24.0 % 22.4 % 21.9 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) include compensation and benefit costs (including stores, headquarters, buying and merchandising and distribution centers); occupancy and operating costs of our retail, distribution and corporate facilities; freight expenses associated with moving merchandise from our distribution centers to our retail stores, and among distribution and retail facilities; advertising expenses, offset by vendor payments for reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs; net operations of servicing the Kohls credit card; and other administrative costs. Depreciation and amortization and preopening expenses are not included in SG&A. The classification of these expenses varies across the retail industry. SG&A for 2008 increased $239 million, or 6.5%, over 2007. The net increase in SG&A dollars reflects incremental costs at newly opened stores, partially offset by decreases at comparable stores reflecting our ongoing efforts to control costs in the current economic environment. As expected, SG&A increased more than sales, but less than new store growth of 8.1%. Distribution center costs, which are included in SG&A, totaled $166 million for 2008, $165 million for 2007 and $150 million for 2006. These costs reflect the benefits of investments in technology in our distribution centers that continue to generate operating efficiencies. The revenue sharing agreement related to our Kohls credit card accounts generated higher revenues in 2008 than in 2007. Even though we continue to see an increase in the number of accounts which carry balances and are ultimately charged off, these increases were more than offset by increases in finance charges and late charge fees. 21 Table of Contents Net advertising costs increased $51 million to $890 million for 2008. As a result of current market conditions, we made a conscious decision to increase advertising costs in 2008, including the most aggressive holiday marketing campaign in our history. SG&A for 2007 increased $275 million, or 8.0%, over 2006. Even though the increase in SG&A was higher than the increase in sales, it was lower than new store growth of 13.8%. We achieved leverage in credit and corporate expenses for 2007, but stores, advertising and distribution centers did not leverage primarily due to lower comparable store sales, our desire to maintain a positive customer in store experience and incremental marketing expenses associated with the launch of new brand initiatives and new store openings. These increases were partially offset by lower incentive compensation expenses. Depreciation and amortization. 2008 2007 2006 (Dollars in millions) Depreciation and amortization $ 541 $ 452 $ 388 As a percent of net sales 3.3 % 2.7 % 2.5 % The increases in depreciation and amortization are primarily due to the addition of new stores and the mix of owned compared to leased stores. Preopening expenses. 2008 2007 2006 Preopening expenses (in millions) $ 42 $ 61 $ 50 Number of stores opened 75 112 85 Average cost per store (in thousands) $ 570 $ 500 $ 580 Preopening expenses include the costs incurred prior to new store openings, such as advertising, hiring and training costs for new employees, processing and transporting initial merchandise, and rent expense. The average cost per store fluctuates based on the mix of stores opened in new markets compared to existing markets (with new markets being more expensive) and the mix of leased and owned stores (with leased stores being more expensive). The increase in the average cost per store for 2008 compared to 2007 is primarily due to an increase in the number of ground leased stores which were opened in 2008. Under GAAP, we are required to recognize rent expense when we take possession of the property, so must recognize rental expense for ground leased properties several months prior to the actual opening of the store and, in most cases, before rental payments are due. The decrease in the average cost per store for 2007 compared to 2006 is due to shifting more advertising to the post grand opening period and to an increase in the percentage of stores which were opened in existing markets rather than new markets. Operating income. 2008 2007 2006 (Dollars in millions) Operating income $ 1,536 $ 1,804 $ 1,815 As a percent of net sales 9.4 % 11.0 % 11.6 % The changes in operating income and operating income as a percent of net sales are due to the factors discussed above. Interest expense. 2008 2007 2006 (Dollars in millions) Interest expense, net $ 111 $ 62 $ 41 22 Table of Contents Net interest expense for 2008 increased $49 million, or 79%, over 2007 primarily due to the $1 billion in new debt that was issued in September 2007. Reductions in capitalized interest due to lower capital expenditures also contributed to the increase. Net interest expense for 2007 increased $21 million, or 51%, over 2006 primarily due to higher outstanding debt balances, including both advances on our short term credit facilities and $1 billion in new debt that was issued in September 2007. Lower interest income on investments also contributed to the increase as we used proceeds from the 2007 debt issuance and the 2006 sale of our credit card portfolio to fund stock repurchases. These increases were partially offset by higher capitalized interest due to increased capital expenditures. Income taxes. 2008 2007 2006 (Dollars in millions) Provision for income taxes $ 540 $ 658 $ 665 Effective tax rate 37.9 % 37.8 % 37.5 % The effective tax rate for 2008 was comparable to the 2007 rate. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to a decrease in the amount of tax exempt interest earned in 2007 compared to 2006 and a shift in the mix of new stores in certain jurisdictions. The tax rate for 2006 benefited from the tax free interest earned on investments. Inflation Although we expect that our operating results will be influenced by general economic conditions, including fluctuations in food, fuel and energy prices, we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations during the periods presented. However, there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary ongoing cash requirements are for capital expenditures in connection with our expansion and remodeling programs and seasonal and new store inventory purchases. Our working capital and inventory levels typically build throughout the fall, peaking during the November and December holiday selling season. Our primary sources of funds are cash flow provided by operations, short term trade credit and our lines of credit. Short term trade credit, in the form of extended payment terms for inventory purchases, represents a significant source of financing for merchandise inventories. Seasonal cash needs are met by the lines of credit available under our $900 million revolving credit facility. We anticipate that we will be able to satisfy our working capital requirements, planned capital expenditures and debt service requirements with available cash and short term investments, proceeds from cash flows from operations, short term trade credit, seasonal borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other sources of financing. We expect to generate adequate cash flow from operating activities to sustain current levels of operations. 2008 2007 2006 (Dollars in millions) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,701 $ 1,235 $ 3,120 Investing activities (1,442 ) (1,568 ) (1,440 ) Financing activities (273 ) 325 (1,618 ) 23 Table of Contents Operating activities. Despite the decrease in net income, cash provided by operations increased 38% over 2007 to $1.7 billion in 2008. This increase in operating cash flow was primarily attributable to a $335 million reduction in cash used for inventory purchases. At January 31, 2009, total merchandise inventories decreased $57 million, or 2%, from year end 2007. On a per store basis, merchandise inventories at January 31, 2009 decreased 9.3% from year end 2007. Clearance inventory units per store are down approximately four times as much as merchandise inventories per store. These reductions are the result of our conservative sales and receipt planning. Accounts payable at January 31, 2009 increased $45 million from year end 2007. Accounts payable as a percent of inventory was 31.5% at January 31, 2009, compared to 29.3% at year end 2007, primarily due to strong inventory management, our cycle time reduction initiatives and improved vendor financing management. The $1.9 billion decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to the cash proceeds of $1.6 billion received in April 2006 in conjunction with the sale of our proprietary credit card portfolio. The primary use of operating cash flow for 2007 was an increase in merchandise inventories of $275 million. The primary source of operating cash flow for 2007 was a $149 million increase in accrued and other long term liabilities. Accounts payable was a $98 million use of operating cash flow in 2007, compared to a $104 million source of operating cash flow in 2006. Merchandise inventories used net cash of $275 million in 2007. The 11% increase in our ending inventory balance from year end 2006 to 2007 was primarily due to the increase in the number of stores. On a per store basis, merchandise inventories at year end 2007 decreased 2.6% from year end 2006, due to conservative receipt plans for Spring 2008. Accounts payable at year end 2007 decreased $98 million from year end 2006. Accounts payable as a percent of inventory was 29.3% at year end 2007, compared to 36.2% at year end 2006, reflecting reduced receipts of Spring 2008 merchandise as a result of conservative sales planning and increased vendor allowances. Investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $1.4 billion in 2008, compared to $1.6 billion in 2007 as decreases in capital expenditures were substantially offset by a comparable decrease in net investment activity. Net purchases and sales of investments used cash of $439 million in 2008 and $52 million in 2007. As of January 31, 2009, we had investments in auction rate securities (ARS) with a par value of $407 million and an estimated fair value of $332 million. ARS are long term debt instruments with interest rates reset through periodic short term auctions, which are typically held every 35 days. Beginning in February 2008, liquidity issues in the global credit markets resulted in the failure of auctions for substantially all of our ARS. A failed auction occurs when the amount of securities submitted for sale in the auction exceeds the amount of purchase bids. As a result, holders are unable to liquidate their investment through the auction. A failed auction is not a default of the debt instrument, but does set a new interest rate in accordance with the terms of the debt instrument. A failed auction limits liquidity for holders until there is a successful auction, another market for ARS develops or the debt matures. ARS are generally callable by the issuer at any time. Scheduled auctions continue to be held until the ARS matures or is called. Proceeds from the sale of ARS were $93 million in 2008, including $17 million which were called at par subsequent to February 2008. To date, we have collected all interest payable on outstanding ARS when due and expect to continue to do so in the future. At this time, we have no reason to believe that any of the underlying issuers of our ARS or their insurers are presently at risk. While the auction failures limit our ability to liquidate these investments, we believe that the ARS failures will have no significant impact on our ability to fund ongoing operations and growth initiatives. 24 Table of Contents Capital expenditures include costs for new store openings, store remodels, distribution center openings and other base capital needs. Capital expenditures totaled $1.0 billion for 2008, a $528 million decrease from 2007. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the number of new store openings in 2008 compared to 2007. We opened 75 stores in 2008 compared to 112 stores in 2007. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2009 are expected to be approximately $800 million. The actual amount of our future capital expenditures will depend primarily on the number of new stores opened, the mix of owned, leased or acquired stores, the number of stores remodeled and the timing of distribution center openings. We do not anticipate that our expansion plans will be limited by any restrictive covenants in our financing agreements. We believe that our capital structure is well positioned to support our expansion plans. We anticipate that internally generated cash flows will be the primary source of funding for future growth. Capital expenditures, including favorable lease rights, by major category were as follows: 2008 2007 2006 New stores 68 % 77 % 76 % Remodels / relocations 12 6 2 Distribution centers 4 3 6 Other 16 14 16 Acquisition of property and equipment and favorable lease rights 100 % 100 % 100 % Net cash used in investing activities increased $128 million for 2007 compared to 2006. The increase reflects higher capital expenditures, partially offset by the net impact of short term investing activities. Net short term investment activity resulted in a use of funds of $52 million in 2007 and $270 million in 2006. Net short term investment activity reflects investment funds used to purchase treasury stock and the investment of proceeds from the $1 billion of new debt issued in September 2007 and the sale of our private label credit card portfolio in 2006. Capital expenditures totaled $1.5 billion for 2007, a $379 million increase over 2006 primarily due to an increase in the number of stores opened and an increase in the number of remodels. Financing activities. Our financing activities used cash of $273 million in 2008 and provided cash of $325 million in 2007. The change reflects the proceeds from issuance of debt in 2007 and lower treasury stock repurchases in 2008. We have various facilities upon which we may draw funds, including a $900 million senior unsecured revolving facility and two demand notes with aggregate availability of $50 million. The $900 million revolving facility expires in October 2011. The co leads of this facility, The Bank of New York Mellon and Bank of America, have each committed $100 million. The remaining 12 lenders have each committed between $30 and $130 million. We had no amounts outstanding on our lines of credit at either year end 2008 or year end 2007. Average borrowings under these facilities were $40 million for 2008, $63 million for 2007 and $19 million for 2006. The decrease from 2007 to 2008 reflects decreased cash needs due to lower inventory levels, capital expenditures and stock repurchases. Our credit ratings have been unchanged since September 2007 when we issued $1 billion in debt. Our ratings are currently as follows: Moodys Standard& Poors Fitch Long term debt Baa1 BBB+ BBB+ 25 Table of Contents We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through open market cash purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved could be material. In September 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $2.5 billion share repurchase program which is intended to return excess capital to our shareholders. As a result of the current economic environment, we have temporarily discontinued repurchases under this program. We will continue to evaluate stock repurchases based on market conditions and our liquidity position, but do not currently expect any share repurchases in 2009. When share repurchases are resumed, we expect to continue executing this share repurchase program primarily in open market transactions, subject to market conditions. Total repurchases under the repurchase plans were as follows: 2008 2007 2006 Total $2.5 Billion Program: Shares (in thousands) 6,048 7,409 13,457 Cost (in millions) $ 261 $ 372 $ 633 Cost Per Share $ 43.19 $ 50.24 $ 47.07 $2 Billion Program: Shares (in thousands) 5,334 27,466 32,800 Cost (in millions) $ 373 $ 1,627 $ 2,000 Cost Per Share $ 69.97 $ 59.22 $ 60.97 Total: Shares (in thousands) 6,048 12,743 27,466 46,257 Cost (in millions) $ 261 $ 745 $ 1,627 $ 2,633 Cost Per Share $ 43.19 $ 58.50 $ 59.22 $ 56.93 We also acquire shares from employees in lieu of amounts required to satisfy minimum tax withholding requirements upon the vesting of the employees restricted stock. Such shares are then designated as treasury shares. Our financing activities generated $325 million of cash in 2007, compared to using $1.6 billion in 2006. The change is the result of proceeds from the issuance of debt in 2007 and lower treasury stock purchases in 2007. Key financial ratios. Key financial ratios that provide certain measures of our liquidity are as follows: 2008 2007 2006 Working capital (In Millions) $ 1,885 $ 1,953 $ 1,482 Current ratio 2.04:1 2.10:1 1.78:1 Debt/capitalization 23.5 % 25.3 % 15.9 % Ratio of earnings to fixed charges 4.47 5.97 7.61 The decreases in working capital and the current ratio as of year end 2008 compared to year end 2007 were primarily due to lower inventory levels and a higher accounts payable balance. The debt/capitalization ratio reflects higher capitalization at year end 2008 compared to year end 2007 due to current year earnings. The decrease in the earnings to fixed charges ratio was the result of lower income before taxes and higher interest expense on our debt due to the $1 billion in debt that was issued in September 2007. 26 Table of Contents The increase in working capital and the current ratio as of year end 2007 compared to year end 2006 was primarily due to higher inventories and short term investments and decreases in accounts payable and taxes payable. The increase in the debt/capitalization ratio represents higher debt levels, partially offset by higher capitalization. The higher debt levels reflect the $1 billion of long term notes that were issued in September 2007. The higher capitalization is the result of earnings and stock option exercises, partially offset by share repurchases. The decrease in the earnings to fixed charges ratio was the result of lower income before taxes, including higher interest expense on our debt and higher rent expense attributable to interest. Debt Covenant Compliance. Our debt agreements contain various covenants including limitations on additional indebtedness and the following leverage ratio: (Dollars inMillions) Total Debt per Balance Sheet $ 2,070 Other Debt Subtotal 2,070 Rent x 8 3,580 A Included Indebtedness $ 5,650 Net Worth $ 6,739 Investments (accounted for under equity method) Subtotal 6,739 Included Indebtedness 5,650 B Capitalization $ 12,389 Leverage Ratio (A/B) 0.46 Maximum permitted Leverage Ratio 0.70 As of January 31, 2009, we were in compliance with all debt covenants and expect to remain in compliance during fiscal 2009. Free Cash Flow. Free cash flow is a non GAAP financial measure which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Free cash flow should be evaluated in addition to, and not considered a substitute for, other financial measures such as net income and cash flow provided by operations. We believe that free cash flow represents our ability to generate additional cash flow from our business operations. The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities, a GAAP measure, to free cash flow, a non GAAP measure. 2008 2007 2006 (In Millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,701 $ 1,235 $ 3,120 Acquisition of property and equipment and favorable lease rights (1,014 ) (1,542 ) (1,163 ) Free cash flow $ 687 $ (307 ) $ 1,957 27 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations as of January 31, 2009 are as follows: Total Less Than 1Year 1 3Years 3 5Years More than 5Years) (In Millions) Recorded contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 1,900 $ $ 400 $ $ 1,500 Capital leases 177 17 27 16 117 2,077 17 427 16 1,617 Unrecorded contractual obligations: Interest payments: Long term debt 1,861 123 237 194 1,307 Capital leases 113 13 22 19 59 Operating leases (a) 11,155 444 913 890 8,908 Royalties 225 43 94 63 25 Purchase obligations (b) 2,584 2,584 Other (c) 36 36 15,974 3,243 1,266 1,166 10,299 Total $ 18,051 $ 3,260 $ 1,693 $ 1,182 $ 11,916 (a) Our leases typically require that we pay real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs in addition to the minimum rental payments included in the table above. Such costs vary from period to period and totaled $148 million for 2008, $135 million for 2007 and $123 million for 2006. (b) Our purchase obligations consist mainly of purchase orders for merchandise. Amounts committed under open purchase orders for merchandise are cancelable without penalty prior to a date that precedes the vendors scheduled shipment date. (c) Other includes primarily commitments for stores to be opened in 2009. We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on February 4, 2007. It is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax positions may change within the next 12 months, primarily as a result of ongoing audits. While it is possible that one or more of these audits may be resolved in the next year, it is not anticipated that payment of any such amounts in future periods will affect liquidity and cash flows. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not provided any financial guarantees as of year end 2008. We have not created, and are not party to, any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating our business. We do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. A discussion of the more significant estimates follows. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Retail Inventory Method and Inventory Valuation We value our inventory at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on the first in, first out (FIFO) basis using the retail inventory method (RIM). RIM is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality. Under RIM, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting 28 Table of Contents gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail value of the inventories. The use of RIM will result in inventories being valued at the lower of cost or market as markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories. Based on a review of historical clearance markdowns, current business trends, expected vendor funding and discontinued merchandise categories, an adjustment to inventory is recorded to reflect additional markdowns which are estimated to be necessary to liquidate existing clearance inventories and reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market. Management believes that our inventory valuation approximates the net realizable value of clearance inventory and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market. Vendor Allowances We record vendor allowances and discounts in the income statement when the purpose for which those monies were designated is fulfilled. Allowances provided by vendors generally relate to profitability of inventory recently sold and, accordingly, are reflected as reductions to cost of merchandise sold as negotiated. Vendor allowances will fluctuate based on the amount of promotional and clearance markdowns necessary to liquidate the inventory. Vendor allowances received for advertising or fixture programs reduce our expense or expenditure for the related advertising or fixture program when appropriate. See also Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, Business and Summary of Accounting Policies. Insurance Reserve Estimates We use a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation, general liability and employee related health care benefits, a portion of which is paid by our associates. We use a third party actuary, which considers historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions, to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks. A change in claims frequency and severity of claims from historical experience as well as changes in state statutes and the mix of states in which we operate could result in a change to the required reserve levels. We retain the initial risk of $500,000 per occurrence under our workers compensation insurance policy and $250,000 per occurrence under our general liability policy. We also have a lifetime medical payment limit of $1.5 million. Impairment of Assets and Closed Store Reserves We have a significant investment in property and equipment and favorable lease rights. The related depreciation and amortization is computed using estimated useful lives of up to 50 years. We review our long lived assets held for use (including favorable lease rights) for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances, such as decisions to close a store, indicates the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. We have historically not experienced any significant impairment of long lived assets or closed store reserves. Decisions to close a store can also result in accelerated depreciation over the revised useful life. When operations at a leased store are discontinued, a reserve is established for the discounted difference between the rent and the expected sublease rental income. A significant change in cash flows, market valuation, demand for real estate or other factors, could result in an increase or decrease in the reserve requirement or impairment charge. Income Taxes We pay income taxes based on tax statutes, regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various taxing authorities. Our effective income tax rate was 37.9% in 2008, 37.8% in 2007 and 37.5% in 2006. The effective rate is impacted by changes in law, location of new stores, level of earnings and the result of tax audits. Operating Leases As of January 31, 2009, we leased 641 of our 1,004 retail stores. Many lease agreements contain rent holidays, rent escalation clauses and or contingent rent provisions. We recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term, including cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty. We use a time period for our straight line rent expense calculation that equals or exceeds the time period used for depreciation. In addition, the commencement date of the lease term is 29 Table of Contents the earlier of the date when we become legally obligated for the rent payments or the date when we take possession of the building or land for initial setup of fixtures and merchandise or land improvements. New Accounting Pronouncements In January 2009, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) EITF 99 20 1, Amendments to the Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue No. 99 20. This standard prescribes that if the fair value of an available for sale or held to maturity debt security is less than its cost basis at the measurement date, U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires that the reporting entity assess the impaired security to determine whether the impairment is other than temporary. The adoption of this statement in the fourth quarter of 2008 had no impact on our consolidated financial statements. In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. This statement identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with GAAP. We adopted this statement in the fourth quarter of 2008 without a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. A portion of this statement was effective for 2008, while the remaining portion of the statement is effective for our fiscal 2009. In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 157 1, Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB Statement No. 13 and Other Accounting Pronouncements That Address Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease Classification or Measurement under Statement 13 and also issued FSP FAS 157 2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, which collectively remove certain leasing transactions from the scope of SFAS No. 157 and partially delay the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for one year for certain non financial assets and liabilities. In October 2008, the FASB also issued FSP FAS 157 3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active, which clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157 in an inactive market and illustrates how an entity would determine fair value when the market for a financial asset is not active. Although we will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS No. 157, we do not currently believe adoption of the remaining portions of SFAS No. 157 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115, (SFAS No. 159). This standard permits entities to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. A portion of this statement was effective for 2008, while the remaining portion of the statement is effective for our fiscal 2009. We do not expect the adoption of the remaining portions of this statement will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk All of our long term debt at year end 2008 is at fixed interest rates and, therefore, is not affected by changes in interest rates. When our long term debt instruments mature, we may refinance them at then existing market interest rates, which may be more or less than interest rates on the maturing debt. Borrowings under our revolving credit facilities are at variable rates and are affected by changes in interest rates. For 2008, average borrowings under our revolving credit facilities were $40 million. If interest rates on the average 2008 variable rate debt changed by 100 basis points, our annual interest expense would change by $400,000, assuming comparable borrowing levels. We were not a party to any derivative financial instruments in 2008, 2007 or 2006. 30 Table of Contents
