Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary The current economic slowdown has caused disruptions and significant volatility in financial markets, increased rates of mortgage loan default and personal bankruptcy, and declining consumer and business confidence, which has led to decreased levels of consumer spending, particularly on discretionary items. Though we have seen some improvement throughout 2009, as evidenced by increases in our comparable store sales, we believe that our core customer continues to face economic challenges which will result in a very competitive 2010. Total net sales for 2009 were $17.2 billion, a 4.8% increase from 2008. Comparable store sales increased 0.4% over 2008. The Southwest region and the Accessories business reported the strongest comparable store sales growth. Gross margin as a percent of net sales for the year increased approximately 88 basis points over the 2008 rate to 37.8%. Strong inventory management as well as increased penetration of private and exclusive brands contributed to the margin strength. Ending inventory per store (in dollars) decreased 0.9% compared to 2008. Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased approximately 5% compared to the prior year. SG&A as a percentage of net sales, increased, or deleveraged primarily due to increased incentive compensation and changes made to our non management compensation structure. SG&A expenses for the year increased at a rate faster than sales, but at a rate slower than new store growth of 5.5%. Our cost control initiatives are focused on sustainable productivity improvements, not one time cutting of expenses. While we will continue to look for ways to become more efficient, we intend to keep the customer experience in our stores a priority in order to provide consistency across our stores and intend to continue to invest more in store payroll to improve our customer service. Net income increased approximately 12% for 2009 to $991 million, or $3.23 per diluted share, compared to $885 million, or $2.89 per diluted share for 2008. We ended the year with 1,058 stores in 49 states, including 56 which were successfully opened in 2009. We completed 51 store remodels, compared to 36 stores last year. In fiscal 2010, we expect to open approximately 30 stores and remodel 85 stores. Remodels remain a critical part of our long term strategy as we believe it is extremely important to maintain our existing store base, even in this difficult economic environment. Our current expectations for fiscal 2010 assume that consumer spending will continue to be weak throughout 2010. We expect comparable store sales will be driven by increased market share as we expect average transaction value to remain under pressure. Our current expectations for both the first quarter and fiscal 2010 compared to comparable fiscal 2009 periods are as follows: Total sales increase of 4% to 6% Comparable store sales increase of 1% to 3% Gross margin increase of 20 to 30 basis points SG&A dollars to increase 4% to 5% Earnings per diluted share of $0.48 to $0.52 for the first quarter of 2010 and $3.40 to $3.63 for fiscal 2010. Results of Operations Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31. Unless otherwise noted, references to years in this report relate to fiscal years, rather than to calendar years. Fiscal year 2009 (2009) ended on January 30, 2010, fiscal year 2008 (2008) ended on January 31, 2009 and fiscal year 2007 (2007) ended on February 2, 2008. All three years were 52 week years. 21 Table of Contents Net sales. 2009 2008 2007 Net sales (in millions) $ 17,178 $ 16,389 $ 16,474 Number of stores: Open at end of period 1,058 1,004 929 Comparable stores (a) 929 817 732 Sales growth: All stores 4.8 % (0.5 %) 5.6 % Comparable stores (a) 0.4 % (6.9 %) (0.8 %) Net sales per selling square foot (b) $ 217 $ 222 $ 249 (a) Comparable store sales growth is based on sales for stores (including e commerce sales and relocated or expanded stores) which were open throughout both the full current and prior year periods. (b) Net sales per selling square foot is based on stores open for the full current period, excluding e commerce. Net sales for 2009 increased $789 million, or 4.8%, over 2008. New stores contributed $719 million to the increase in net sales over the prior year. Comparable store sales increased $70 million. We opened 56 new stores in 2009, 75 stores in 2008 and 112 stores in 2007. As we open new stores, especially in existing markets, sales may be transferred from existing stores. We estimate that opening new stores in existing markets negatively impacted comparable store sales by approximately 1% in 2009. Drivers of the changes in comparable stores sales were as follows: 2009 2008 2007 Selling price per unit 2.3 % 1.9 % (0.3 )% Units per transaction (4.3 ) (2.9 ) 0.9 Average transaction value (2.0 ) (1.0 ) 0.6 Number of transactions 2.4 (5.9 ) (1.4 ) Comparable store sales 0.4 % (6.9 )% (0.8 )% Net sales, especially in the Southwest region, were favorably impacted by the closure of Mervyns department stores. We continue to aggressively pursue former Mervyns customers through increased advertising efforts and targeted efforts in stores most likely to benefit from former Mervyns customers. In these stores, we have increased staffing levels and provided higher inventory levels and wider assortments in selected categories. We estimate that the Mervyns closure increased our comparable store sales by approximately 140 basis points for the year. The Southwest region reported the strongest 2009 sales growth with comparable store sales increases in the high single digits. We expect to continue to produce strong results in the Southwest in 2010, but we believe our other hot and mild regions will benefit more substantially in 2010 from the merchandising and marketing tactics we developed in 2009 in the Southwest. Lower units per transaction resulted in negative comparable store sales in all regions other than the Southwest and Northwest. By line of business, Accessories, Footwear and Home outperformed our comparable store sales for the year. Accessories was led by strength in sterling silver jewelry, fashion jewelry, and handbags. In Footwear, womens, athletic and childrens shoes performed best. Home was strong in small electrics, bedding and bath. Mens was similar to the company average and was led by active, basics and casual sportswear. Childrens and Womens were below the company average. The Childrens business had strength in toys, infants/toddlers and boys. 22 Table of Contents Womens was strongest in intimate and both classic and updated sportswear, driven by substantial improvement in key private brands such as Sonoma, Croft and Barrow and Apt 9 which achieved strong fourth quarter increases. E commerce revenues increased 38.0% to $492 million for 2009. The sales growth is primarily the result of increased style and size selections offered on line compared with our in store selection as well as the expansion of product categories not available in our stores. Net sales per selling square foot decreased 2% to $217 in 2009. The decrease is primarily due to the underperformance of stores opened in 2008. Net sales for 2008 decreased $85 million, or 0.5%, from 2007. New stores contributed $1.0 billion to the increase in net sales over the prior year. Comparable store sales decreased $1.1 billion, or 6.9% (see the table above for drivers of the change). From a line of business perspective, Accessories reported the strongest comparable store sales in 2008 with strength in sterling silver jewelry and accessories/handbags. Childrens, Mens and Footwear outperformed the comparable store sales for the year, while Womens and Home trailed the company. The Northeast, Midwest and Mid Atlantic regions reported the strongest comparable store sales for 2008. E commerce revenues increased 48% to $356 million for 2008 as we continued to expand the selections offered on line. As reflected in the table below, our merchandise mix has remained relatively constant over the last three years: 2009 2008 2007 Womens 32 % 32 % 33 % Mens 19 19 19 Home 18 18 18 Childrens 13 13 13 Accessories 10 10 9 Footwear 8 8 8 Gross margin. 2009 2008 2007 (Dollars in millions) Gross margin $ 6,498 $ 6,055 $ 6,014 As a percent of net sales 37.8 % 36.9 % 36.5 % Gross margin includes the total cost of products sold, including product development costs, net of vendor payments other than reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs; inventory shrink; markdowns; freight expenses associated with moving merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers; shipping and handling expenses of e commerce sales; and terms cash discount. Our gross margin may not be comparable with that of other retailers because we include distribution center costs in selling, general and administrative expenses while other retailers may include these expenses in cost of merchandise sold. The $443 million, or 7.3%, increase in gross margin dollars for 2009 compared to 2008 reflects higher sales volume including incremental sales at newly opened stores. Gross margin as a percentage of sales increased 88 basis points to 37.8% for 2009. Strong inventory management and increased penetration of private and exclusive brands contributed to the margin strength. In addition to carrying a lower level of inventory per store, we continue to focus on receiving merchandise in season as needed through our cycle time reduction initiatives. This strategy reduces our seasonal merchandise clearance inventories. Sales of private and exclusive brands reached 44% of net sales for 2009, an increase of 220 basis points over 2008. Additionally, our ongoing markdown and size optimization initiatives continue to develop and have favorable impacts on our gross margin as a percent of net sales. 23 Table of Contents Gross margin for 2008 increased $41 million, or 0.7%, over 2007. The improvement in gross margin as a percent of net sales for 2008 compared to 2007 was driven by the continued impact of our merchandise and inventory management initiatives and increased penetration of private and exclusive brands. Sales of private and exclusive brands were approximately 42% of net sales for 2008, an increase of over 260 basis points over 2007. Selling, general and administrative expenses. 2009 2008 2007 (Dollars in millions) Selling, general, and administrative expenses $ 4,144 $ 3,936 $ 3,697 As a percent of net sales 24.1 % 24.0 % 22.4 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) include compensation and benefit costs (including stores, headquarters, buying and merchandising and distribution centers); occupancy and operating costs of our retail, distribution and corporate facilities; freight expenses associated with moving merchandise from our distribution centers to our retail stores, and among distribution and retail facilities; advertising expenses, offset by vendor payments for reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs; net revenues from the Kohls credit card agreement with JPMorgan Chase; and other administrative costs. We do not include depreciation and amortization and preopening expenses in SG&A. The classification of these expenses varies across the retail industry. SG&A for 2009 increased $208 million, or 5.3%, over 2008. SG&A increased primarily due to store growth and increased incentive compensation and changes made to our non management compensation structure. Hourly store payroll costs as a percentage of net sales decreased, or leveraged, in 2009 as reduced inventory and clearance levels resulted in fewer hours spent on replenishment and inventory markdowns. We were able to shift some of these savings to provide additional customer assistance on the selling floor and at point of sale. This emphasis on customer service contributed to an approximately 7% improvement in our customer service scores over the prior year. Customer service scores are derived from direct customer surveys conducted by an independent research firm. Distribution center costs, which are included in SG&A, totaled $168 million for 2009, $166 million for 2008 and $165 million for 2007. Payroll costs increased as increased sales required additional processing hours to facilitate the transfer of merchandise to the stores. These increases were offset by the benefits of technology investments in our distribution centers that continue to generate operating efficiencies. Lower fuel costs also contributed to the decrease. In connection with the April 2006 sale of our proprietary credit card accounts to JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPMorgan Chase), we entered into a service and revenue sharing agreement. Pursuant to this agreement, JPMorgan Chase issues Kohls branded private label credit cards to new and existing Kohls customers. Since we do not own the receivables, the receivables and the related allowance for bad debt reserve are not reported on our balance sheets. Risk management decisions are jointly managed by JPMorgan Chase and us. We handle all customer service functions and are responsible for all advertising and marketing related to credit card customers and the majority of the associated expenses. Net revenues of the program are shared with JPMorgan Chase according to a fixed percentage and are settled monthly. Net revenues include finance charge and late fee revenues, less write offs of uncollectible accounts and other expenses. Net revenues from the credit card program increased in 2009 as growth in finance charges and late fee revenues exceeded increases in write offs of uncollectible accounts. Advertising and information services expenses, measured in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales, decreased in 2009 compared to 2008. Advertising expenses, net of vendor allowances, were $846 million for 2009 and $890 million for 2008. 24 Table of Contents Partially offsetting these expense reductions were higher fixed occupancy and variable store costs due primarily to an increase in the number of stores and higher accrued incentive expenses as a result of improved performance for 2009 and changes to our non management compensation structure. SG&A for 2008 increased $239 million, or 6.5%, over 2007. The net increase in SG&A dollars reflects incremental costs at newly opened stores, partially offset by decreases at comparable stores reflecting our commitment to control costs in a difficult economic environment. SG&A increased more than sales, but less than new store growth of 8.1%. Depreciation and amortization. 2009 2008 2007 (In millions) Depreciation and amortization $ 590 $ 541 $ 452 The increases in depreciation and amortization are primarily due to the addition of new stores and remodels. Preopening expenses. 2009 2008 2007 Preopening expenses (in millions) $ 52 $ 42 $ 61 Number of stores opened 56 75 112 Preopening expenses include the costs incurred prior to new store openings, such as advertising, hiring and training costs for new employees, processing and transporting initial merchandise, and rent expense. The average cost per store fluctuates based on the mix of stores opened in new markets compared to existing markets, with new markets being more expensive. Preopening expenses for 2009 increased despite a decrease in the number of stores opened primarily due to an increase in the number of leased stores which opened in 2009. Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), we are required to recognize rent expense when we take possession of the property, so we must recognize rental expense for ground leased properties several months prior to the actual opening of the store and, in most cases, before rental payments are due. Preopening expense for 2008 decreased compared to 2007 primarily due to a decrease in the number of stores slightly offset by an increase in cost per store due to the number of ground lease stores. Operating income. 2009 2008 2007 (Dollars in millions) Operating income $ 1,712 $ 1,536 $ 1,804 As a percent of net sales 10.0 % 9.4 % 11.0 % The changes in operating income and operating income as a percent of net sales are due to the factors discussed above. Interest expense. 2009 2008 2007 (In millions) Interest expense, net $ 124 $ 111 $ 62 25 Table of Contents Net interest expense for 2009 increased $13 million, or 12%, over 2008. The increase is attributable to lower interest income due to lower interest rates on our investments, partially offset by higher average investments. A reduction in capitalized interest due to lower capital expenditures in 2009 also contributed to the increase in interest expense. Net interest expense for 2008 increased $49 million, or 79%, over 2007 primarily due to $1 billion in new debt that was issued in September 2007. Reductions in capitalized interest due to lower capital expenditures also contributed to the increase. Income taxes. 2009 2008 2007 (Dollars in millions) Provision for income taxes $ 597 $ 540 $ 658 Effective tax rate 37.6 % 37.9 % 37.8 % The effective tax rate for 2009 was comparable to the 2008 and 2007 tax rates. Inflation Although we expect that our operating results will be influenced by general economic conditions, including fluctuations in food, fuel and energy prices, we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations during the periods presented. However, there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary ongoing cash requirements are for capital expenditures in connection with our expansion and remodeling programs and seasonal and new store inventory purchases. Our primary sources of funds are cash flow provided by operations, short term trade credit and our lines of credit. Short term trade credit, in the form of extended payment terms for inventory purchases, represents a significant source of financing for merchandise inventories. Seasonal cash needs may be met by the line of credit available under our revolving credit facility. Our working capital and inventory levels typically build throughout the fall, peaking during the November and December holiday selling season. We anticipate that we will be able to satisfy our working capital requirements, planned capital expenditures and debt service requirements with available cash and cash equivalents, proceeds from cash flows from operations, short term trade credit, seasonal borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other sources of financing. We expect to generate adequate cash flow from operating activities to sustain current levels of operations. As of January 30, 2010, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.3 billion. We generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow in 2009 and expect to generate $800 to $900 million in 2010. (See the Free Cash Flow discussion later in this Liquidity and Capital Resources section for additional discussion of free cash flow, a non GAAP financial measure.) We have no debt maturing prior to 2011. We expect to use cash and cash equivalents on hand and funds from operations to repay both the $300 million of long term debt which is due in March 2011 and the $100 million of long term debt which is due in October 2011. In the first quarter of 2006, we sold our proprietary credit card accounts and entered into a service and revenue sharing agreement with JPMorgan Chase. This agreement will expire in April 2011. We are currently 26 Table of Contents exploring various options related to the Kohls credit card, including entering into a new agreement with an alternative partner. We expect to reach a decision by Fall 2010. This timing could be impacted by the timing of the issuance of the final CARD Act regulation. We currently believe that we will be able to negotiate a new contract with a financial institution that would be similar in nature to our existing arrangement. If, however, we are unable to do so, we may repurchase the receivables from JPMorgan Chase. We would expect to use a combination of cash on hand, funds from operations and or proceeds from the issuance of debt and or stock to fund the repurchase of the receivables. If we do not repurchase the receivables, we will consider other potential uses for our cash equivalent balances after finalizing a new agreement. 2009 2008 2007 (In millions) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 2,234 $ 1,698 $ 1,205 Investing activities (640 ) (963 ) (1,596 ) Financing activities 30 (273 ) 325 Operating activities. Cash provided by operations increased 32% in 2009 to $2.2 billion. The most significant source of operating cash flow for 2009 was a $258 million increase in cash flows from accounts payable activities. Short term trade credit, in the form of extended payment terms for inventory purchases, represents a significant source of financing for merchandise inventories. At January 30, 2010, total merchandise inventories increased $124 million, or 4%, from year end 2008. On a dollars per store basis, merchandise inventories at January 30, 2010 decreased 0.9% from year end 2008. Clearance inventory units per store are down approximately 14%. These reductions are the result of inventory management initiatives, including our conservative sales and receipt planning and lower clearance levels. Accounts payable at January 30, 2010 increased $307 million from year end 2008. Accounts payable as a percent of inventory was 40.6% at January 30, 2010, compared to 31.5% at year end 2008. Our cycle time process improvements on fashion categories and a focus on replenishment of basics have allowed us to consistently receive inventory based on sales volume and to improve our inventory management by merchandise area and store location. With the cooperation of our vendor partners, we have been able to reduce our lead time by accelerating inventory receipts to support our recent sales growth. Extended payment terms have also contributed to an increase in our accounts payable balance. We provided our vendors with financing, at a rate better than market, in exchange for extended payment terms. Despite the decrease in net income in 2008, cash provided by operations increased 41% over 2007 to $1.7 billion in 2008, primarily due to a $335 million reduction in cash used for inventory purchases. Compared to year end 2007, total merchandise inventories at January 31, 2009 decreased 2% and inventory per store decreased 9.3%. Clearance inventory units per store were down approximately four times more than total inventory per store. These reductions were the result of our conservative sales and receipt planning. Accounts payable at January 31, 2009 increased $45 million from year end 2007. Accounts payable as a percent of inventory was 31.5% at January 31, 2009, compared to 29.3% at year end 2007, primarily due to strong inventory management, our cycle time reduction initiatives and improved vendor financing management. Investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $323 million to $640 million in 2009, primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures. 27 Table of Contents Capital expenditures include costs for new store openings, store remodels, distribution center openings and other base capital needs. Capital expenditures totaled $666 million for 2009, a $348 million decrease from 2008. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the number of new store openings from 75 in 2008 to 56 in 2009. Capital expenditures, including favorable lease rights, by major category were as follows: 2009 2008 2007 New stores 54 % 68 % 77 % Remodels/relocations 16 12 6 Distribution centers 4 3 Capitalized software 9 5 4 Fixtures and store improvements 9 4 3 Other 12 7 7 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % Despite a decrease in new store openings (30 expected in 2010 compared to 56 in 2009), we expect total capital expenditures to increase to approximately $900 million in fiscal 2010 due to an increase in store remodels (85 expected in 2010 compared to 51 in 2009), the purchase of a second e commerce distribution facility on the west coast, and significant investment in our website to support the rapid growth of our e commerce business. The actual amount of our future capital expenditures will depend primarily on the number of new stores opened, the mix of owned, leased or acquired stores, the number of stores remodeled and the timing of distribution center openings. We do not anticipate that our expansion plans will be limited by any restrictive covenants in our financing agreements. We believe that our capital structure is well positioned to support our expansion plans. We anticipate that internally generated cash flows will be the primary source of funding for future growth. Net purchases and sales of long term investments generated cash of $28 million in 2009 and $40 million in 2008. As of January 30, 2010, we had investments in auction rate securities (ARS) with a par value of $379 million and an estimated fair value of $320 million. ARS are long term debt instruments with interest rates reset through periodic short term auctions, which are typically held every 35 days. Beginning in February 2008, liquidity issues in the global credit markets resulted in the failure of auctions for all of our ARS. A failed auction occurs when the amount of securities submitted for sale in the auction exceeds the amount of purchase bids. As a result, holders are unable to liquidate their investment through the auction. A failed auction is not a default of the debt instrument, but does set a new interest rate in accordance with the terms of the debt instrument. A failed auction limits liquidity for holders until there is a successful auction or until such time as another market for ARS develops. ARS are generally callable by the issuer at any time. Scheduled auctions continue to be held until the ARS matures or is called. To date, we have collected all interest payable on outstanding ARS when due and expect to continue to do so in the future. In addition, all redemptions to date were made at par. At this time, we have no reason to believe that any of the underlying issuers of our ARS or their insurers are presently at risk or that the reduced liquidity has had a significant impact on the underlying credit quality of the assets backing our ARS. While the auction failures limit our ability to liquidate these investments, we believe that the ARS failures will have no significant impact on our ability to fund ongoing operations and growth initiatives. Net cash used in investing activities was $1.0 billion in 2008 compared to $1.6 billion in 2007. The decrease reflects lower capital expenditures, substantially offset by net investment activity. Capital expenditures totaled $1.0 billion for 2008, a $528 million decrease from 2007. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease of 37 store openings in 2008 compared to 2007. Net purchases and sales of long term investments generated cash of $40 million in 2008 and used cash of $80 million in 2007. 28 Table of Contents Financing activities. Our financing activities provided cash of $30 million in 2009 compared to using $273 million in 2008. The change is primarily due to treasury stock purchases in the first six months of 2008. We have no debt maturing until 2011. We expect to use cash on hand and funds from operations to repay both the $300 million of long term debt which is due in March 2011 and the $100 million of long term debt which is due in October 2011. Our credit ratings have been unchanged since September 2007 when we issued $1 billion in debt. Our ratings are currently as follows: Moodys Standard& Poors Fitch Long term debt Baa1 BBB+ BBB+ We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through open market cash purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved could be material. In September 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a $2.5 billion share repurchase program which is intended to return excess capital to our shareholders. As a result of the current economic environment, we have not purchased any shares under this program since July 2008. In 2008, we repurchased 6.0 million shares at a total cost of $261 million. The program does not have a specified termination date. Our financing activities used cash of $273 million in 2008 and provided cash of $325 million in 2007. The change reflects the proceeds from the issuance of $1 billion of debt in 2007 and lower treasury stock purchases in 2008. Key financial ratios. Key financial ratios that provide certain measures of our liquidity are as follows: 2009 2008 2007 Working capital (In Millions) $ 3,095 $ 1,884 $ 1,952 Current ratio 2.29:1 2.02:1 2.09:1 Debt/capitalization 20.8 % 23.5 % 25.3 % Ratio of earnings to fixed charges 4.42 4.47 5.97 The increase in working capital and the current ratio as of year end 2009 compared to year end 2008 was primarily due to higher cash and cash equivalents. The decrease in the debt/capitalization ratio reflects higher capitalization, primarily due to earnings. The ratio of earnings to fixed charges was comparable to 2008. See Exhibit 12.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the calculation of this ratio. The decreases in working capital and the current ratio as of year end 2008 compared to year end 2007 were primarily due to lower inventory levels and a higher accounts payable balance. The debt/capitalization ratio reflects higher capitalization at year end 2008 compared to year end 2007 due to current year earnings. The decrease in the earnings to fixed charges ratio was the result of lower income before taxes and higher interest expense on our debt due to the $1 billion in debt that was issued in September 2007. 29 Table of Contents Debt Covenant Compliance. Our debt agreements contain various covenants including limitations on additional indebtedness and the following leverage ratio: (Dollars inMillions) Total Debt per Balance Sheet $ 2,068 Other Debt Subtotal 2,068 Rent x 8 3,987 A Included Indebtedness $ 6,055 Net Worth $ 7,853 Investments (accounted for under equity method) Subtotal 7,853 Included Indebtedness 6,055 B Capitalization $ 13,908 Leverage Ratio (A/B) 0.44 Maximum permitted Leverage Ratio 0.70 As of January 30, 2010, we were in compliance with all debt covenants and expect to remain in compliance during fiscal 2010. Free Cash Flow. We generated free cash flow of $1.6 billion in 2009, more than double our 2008 free cash flow of $684 million. Free cash flow is a non GAAP financial measure which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Free cash flow should be evaluated in addition to, and not considered a substitute for, other financial measures such as net income and cash flow provided by operations. We believe that free cash flow represents our ability to generate additional cash flow from our business operations. The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities (a GAAP measure) to free cash flow (a non GAAP measure). 2009 2008 2007 (In Millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,234 $ 1,701 $ 1,235 Acquisition of property and equipment and favorable lease rights (666 ) (1,014 ) (1,542 ) Free cash flow $ 1,568 $ 687 $ (307 ) We expect to generate $800 to $900 million of free cash flow in fiscal 2010. 30 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations as of January 30, 2010 were as follows: Total Less Than 1Year 1 3Years 3 5Years More than 5Years (In Millions) Recorded contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 1,900 $ $ 400 $ $ 1,500 Capital leases 174 16 29 20 109 2,074 16 429 20 1,609 Unrecorded contractual obligations: Interest payments: Long term debt 1,738 123 211 194 1,210 Capital leases 103 12 21 18 52 Operating leases (a) 11,038 479 931 917 8,711 Royalties 255 58 105 74 18 Purchase obligations (b) 3,245 3,245 16,379 3,917 1,268 1,203 9,991 Total $ 18,453 $ 3,933 $ 1,697 $ 1,223 $ 11,600 (a) Our leases typically require that we pay real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs in addition to the minimum rental payments included in the table above. Such costs vary from period to period and totaled $157 million for 2009, $148 million for 2008 and $135 million for 2007. (b) Our purchase obligations consist mainly of purchase orders for merchandise. Amounts committed under open purchase orders for merchandise are cancelable without penalty prior to a date that precedes the vendors scheduled shipment date. It is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax positions may change within the next 12 months, primarily as a result of ongoing audits. While it is possible that one or more of these audits may be resolved in the next year, it is not anticipated that payment of any such amounts in future periods will affect liquidity and cash flows. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not provided any financial guarantees as of year end 2009. We have not created, and are not party to, any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating our business. We do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. A discussion of the more significant estimates follows. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Retail Inventory Method and Inventory Valuation We value our inventory at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on the first in, first out (FIFO) basis using the retail inventory method (RIM). RIM is an averaging method that has been widely 31 Table of Contents used in the retail industry due to its practicality. Under RIM, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail value of the inventories. The use of RIM will result in inventories being valued at the lower of cost or market as markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories. Based on a review of historical clearance markdowns, current business trends, expected vendor funding and discontinued merchandise categories, an adjustment to inventory is recorded to reflect additional markdowns which are estimated to be necessary to liquidate existing clearance inventories and reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market. Management believes that our inventory valuation approximates the net realizable value of clearance inventory and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market. Vendor Allowances We record vendor allowances and discounts in the income statement when the purpose for which those monies were designated is fulfilled. Allowances provided by vendors generally relate to profitability of inventory recently sold and, accordingly, are reflected as reductions to cost of merchandise sold as negotiated. Vendor allowances received for advertising or fixture programs reduce our expense or expenditure for the related advertising or fixture program when appropriate. Vendor allowances will fluctuate based on the amount of promotional and clearance markdowns necessary to liquidate the inventory. See also Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, Business and Summary of Accounting Policies. Insurance Reserve Estimates We use a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation, general liability and employee related health care benefits, a portion of which is paid by our associates. We use a third party actuary, which considers historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions, to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks. A change in claims frequency and severity of claims from historical experience as well as changes in state statutes and the mix of states in which we operate could result in a change to the required reserve levels. We retain the initial risk of $500,000 per occurrence under our workers compensation insurance policy and $250,000 per occurrence under our general liability policy. We also have a lifetime medical payment limit of $1.5 million per plan participant. Impairment of Assets and Closed Store Reserves We have a significant investment in property and equipment and favorable lease rights. The related depreciation and amortization is computed using estimated useful lives of up to 50 years. We review our long lived assets held for use (including favorable lease rights, goodwill and trademarks) for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances, such as decisions to close a store, indicates the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. We have historically not experienced any significant impairment of long lived assets or closed store reserves. Decisions to close a store can also result in accelerated depreciation over the revised useful life. When operations at a leased store are discontinued, a reserve is established for the discounted difference between the rent and the expected sublease rental income. A significant change in cash flows, market valuation, demand for real estate or other factors, could result in an increase or decrease in the reserve requirement or impairment charge. Income Taxes We pay income taxes based on tax statutes, regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various taxing authorities. Our effective income tax rate was 37.6% in 2009, 37.9% in 2008 and 37.8% in 2007. The effective rate is impacted by changes in law, location of new stores, level of earnings and the result of tax audits. 32 Table of Contents Operating Leases As of January 30, 2010, we leased 686 of our 1,058 retail stores. Many lease agreements contain rent holidays, rent escalation clauses and or contingent rent provisions. We recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term, including cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty. We use a time period for our straight line rent expense calculation that equals or exceeds the time period used for depreciation. In addition, the commencement date of the lease term is the earlier of the date when we become legally obligated for the rent payments or the date when we take possession of the building or land for initial setup of fixtures and merchandise or land improvements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk All of our long term debt at year end 2009 is at fixed interest rates and, therefore, is not affected by changes in interest rates. When our long term debt instruments mature, we may refinance them at then existing market interest rates, which may be more or less than interest rates on the maturing debt. Cash equivalents and long term investments earn interest at variable rates and are affected by changes in interest rates. During 2009, average investments were $1.6 billion and average yield was 0.6%. If interest rates on the average 2009 variable rate cash equivalents and long term investments increased by 100 basis points, our annual interest income would also increase by approximately $16 million assuming comparable investment levels. We were not a party to any material derivative financial instruments in 2009, 2008 or 2007.
