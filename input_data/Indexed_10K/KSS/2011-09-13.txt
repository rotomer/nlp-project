Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary Total net sales for 2010 were $18.4 billion, a 7.1% increase over 2009. Comparable store sales increased 4.4% over 2009. The Southeast region and the Footwear business reported the strongest comparable store sales growth. Gross margin as a percent of net sales for the year increased approximately 40 basis points over the 2009 rate to 38.2%. Strong inventory management as well as increased penetration of private and exclusive brands contributed to the margin strength. Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased 6% compared to the prior year. SG&A as a percentage of net sales, decreased, or leveraged primarily driven by store payroll and advertising. Net income increased 15% for 2010 to $1.1 billion, or $3.66 per diluted share, compared to $973 million, or $3.17 per diluted share for 2009. We ended the year with 1,089 stores in 49 states, including 31 which were successfully opened in 2010. We expect to open approximately 40 stores in fiscal 2011. Remodels remain a critical part of our long term strategy as we believe it is important to maintain our existing store base. We completed 85 remodels in 2010, compared to 51 in 2009, and expect to remodel approximately 100 stores in 2011. In February 2011, our Board of Directors approved our first ever dividend. The 25 cent per share quarterly dividend will be paid on March 30, 2011 to all shareholders of record as of March 9, 2011. The dividend reflects the Boards confidence in our long term cash flow. We expect to use a portion of future free cash flow to continue to pay quarterly dividends. Our Board of Directors also increased the remaining share repurchase authorization under our existing share repurchase program by $2.6 billion, from $900 million to $3.5 billion. We expect to execute the share repurchase program primarily in open market transactions, subject to market conditions and to complete the program by the end of Fiscal 2013. On November 17, 2010, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase transaction with Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated (Morgan Stanley) to repurchase $1.0 billion of Kohls common stock on an accelerated basis. This accelerated share repurchase was part of the $2.5 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in September 2007. On November 18, 2010, we paid $1.0 billion to Morgan Stanley from cash on hand. We received a total of 18.8 million shares under the program: 12.6 million shares on November 18, 2010, 3.8 million shares on December 7, 2010, 1.5 million on January 11, 2011, and a final delivery of 0.9 million shares on March 3, 2011. We installed electronic signs in approximately 100 stores in 2010. We expect to have installed the signs in all stores by Holiday 2012. In store kiosks were effectively rolled out to all stores in August 2010. The kiosks allow customers to order items which are not available in the store and have them delivered to their home with no shipping costs. Preliminary results from the kiosks have exceeded our plans and we expect to add an additional kiosk in approximately 100 stores in 2011. We believe that consumers will remain focused on value in 2011. We intend to continue to be flexible in our sales and inventory planning and in our expense management in order to react to changes in consumer demand. Additionally, merchandise costs in all apparel categories are expected to be up approximately 10% to 15% overall for Fall 2011 due to inflation in the cost of raw materials, labor and fuel. Specific increases are dependent on the category and the related fabric content. We have been preparing for these cost increases for some time and are working diligently to minimize the impact of these higher costs on a consumer that is still buying cautiously and, therefore, less open to paying higher prices for discretionary goods. 19 Table of Contents Results of Operations Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31. Unless otherwise noted, references to years in this report relate to fiscal years, rather than to calendar years. Fiscal year 2010 (2010) ended on January 29, 2011, fiscal year 2009 (2009) ended on January 30, 2010, and fiscal year 2008 (2008) ended on January 31, 2009. All three years were 52 week years. Net sales. 2010 2009 2008 Net sales (in millions) $ 18,391 $ 17,178 $ 16,389 Number of stores: Opened during the year 31 56 75 Open at end of year 1,089 1,058 1,004 Comparable stores (a) 1,003 929 817 Sales growth: Total 7.1 % 4.8 % (0.5 %) Comparable stores (a) 4.4 % 0.4 % (6.9 %) Net sales per selling square foot (b) $ 222 $ 217 $ 222 (a) Comparable store sales growth is based on sales for stores (including E Commerce sales and relocated or remodeled stores) which were open throughout both the full current and prior year periods (b) Net sales per selling square foot is based on stores open for the full current period, excluding E Commerce. The changes in net sales were due to the following: 2010 2009 2008 (Dollars in millions) Comparable store sales: $ % $ % $ % Stores $ 500 3.1 % $ (62 ) (0.4 )% $ (1,209 ) (7.8 )% E commerce 244 51.7 132 38.7 116 51.8 Total 744 4.4 70 0.4 (1,093 ) (6.9 ) Sales from new stores 469 719 1,008 Total net sales increase (decrease) $ 1,213 7.1 % $ 789 4.8 % $ (85 ) (0.5 )% Drivers of the changes in comparable store sales were as follows: 2010 2009 2008 Selling price per unit (1.5 )% 2.3 % 1.9 % Units per transaction (1.5 ) (4.3 ) (2.9 ) Average transaction value (3.0 ) (2.0 ) (1.0 ) Number of transactions 7.4 2.4 (5.9 ) Comparable store sales 4.4 % 0.4 % (6.9 )% The Southeast region reported the strongest 2010 sales growth with comparable store sales increases in the mid single digits. In 2010, the Southeast region benefited from implementing merchandising and marketing tactics similar to those that were implemented in the West region in 2009. All other regions reported comparable store sales increases of two to three percent for the year. By line of business, Footwear, Mens and Home outperformed our total company comparable store sales growth for the year. Footwear was led by strength in womens and juniors shoes. Mens was led by active and basics. Home was strong in electronics and small electrics. Womens was similar to the company average and was led by Sonoma, juniors, active and updated sportswear. Accessories and Childrens were below the company average. Accessories was strongest in watches, fashion jewelry and sterling silver jewelry. The Childrens business had strength in toys. 20 Table of Contents E Commerce sales, which exclude shipping and other revenues, increased 51.7% to $717 million for 2010. The number of E Commerce transactions increased almost 60% due to increased customer traffic, increased style and size selections offered on line compared with our in store selection and the expansion of product categories not available in our stores. Net sales per selling square foot increased $5 to $222 in 2010. The increase is primarily due to higher comparable store sales. Net sales for 2009 increased 4.8% over 2008 and comparable store sales increased 0.4%. From a line of business perspective, Accessories reported the strongest comparable store sales in 2009 with strength in sterling silver jewelry, fashion jewelry and handbags. Footwear and Home outperformed the comparable store sales for the year, while Womens and Childrens trailed the company. Mens was similar to the company average. The West region, which was favorably impacted by the closure of Mervyns department stores, reported the strongest comparable store sales for 2009. E Commerce sales increased approximately 40% to $473 million for 2009. Our merchandise mix over the last three years is reflected in the table below: Womens 32 % Mens 19 Home 18 Childrens 12 13 Accessories 10 Footwear 8 9 Gross margin. 2010 2009 2008 (Dollars in millions) Gross margin $ 7,032 $ 6,498 $ 6,055 As a percent of net sales 38.2 % 37.8 % 36.9 % Gross margin includes the total cost of products sold, including product development costs, net of vendor payments other than reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs; inventory shrink; markdowns; freight expenses associated with moving merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers; shipping and handling expenses of E Commerce sales; and terms cash discount. Our gross margin may not be comparable with that of other retailers because we include distribution center costs in selling, general and administrative expenses while other retailers may include these expenses in cost of merchandise sold. Gross margin increased $534 million, or 8.2%, in 2010 compared to 2009. Gross margin as a percentage of sales increased 41 basis points to 38.2% for 2010. Strong inventory management and increased penetration of private and exclusive brands contributed to the margin strength. Average inventory per store at year end 2010 is approximately one percent higher than 2009. Clearance inventory units per store are approximately 12% lower this year than in 2009. Sales of private and exclusive brands reached 48% of net sales for 2010, an increase of approximately 290 basis points over 2009. Approximately 80 percent of our merchandise receipts are now subject to our size optimization programs which has also had a positive impact on our gross margin rate. Merchandise costs across all apparel categories are expected to be up approximately 10 to 15% overall for Fall 2011 due to inflation in the cost of raw materials, labor and fuel. Specific increases are dependent on the category and the related fabric content. We have been preparing for these cost increases for some time and are working diligently to minimize the impact of these higher costs on a consumer that is still buying cautiously and, therefore, less open to paying higher prices for discretionary goods. Gross margin for 2009 increased $443 million, or 7.3%, over 2008. The improvement in gross margin as a percent of net sales for 2009 compared to 2008 was driven by strong merchandise and inventory management and increased penetration of private and exclusive brands. Sales of private and exclusive brands reached 44% of net sales in 2009, an increase of 220 basis points over 2008. 21 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expenses. 2010 2009 2008 (Dollars in millions) (Restated) Selling, general, and administrative expenses $ 4,190 $ 3,951 $ 3,769 As a percent of net sales 22.8 % 23.0 % 23.0 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) include compensation and benefit costs (including stores, headquarters, buying and merchandising and distribution centers); rent expense and other occupancy and operating costs of our retail, distribution and corporate facilities; freight expenses associated with moving merchandise from our distribution centers to our retail stores and among distribution and retail facilities; advertising expenses, offset by vendor payments for reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs; net revenues from our Kohls credit card operations; and other administrative costs. SG&A also includes the costs incurred prior to new store openings, such as advertising, hiring and training costs for new employees, processing and transporting initial merchandise, and rent expense. We do not include depreciation and amortization in SG&A. The classification of these expenses varies across the retail industry. SG&A for 2010 increased $239 million, or 6%, over 2009, but decreased as a percentage of net sales, or leveraged. SG&A increased primarily due to store growth, higher sales, and investments in technology and infrastructure related to our E Commerce business. Hourly store payroll costs leveraged in 2010 and continue to be driven by sustainable productivity improvements, such as the rollout of electronic signs. Advertising leveraged in 2010 as we intentionally grew this expense less than sales. We continue to modify our media mix to utilize the most cost effective methods. In 2010, we increased direct mail and digital marketing efforts and decreased print media. Preopening expenses leveraged in 2010 as we opened fewer stores. Information services expenses increased as a percentage of net sales, or deleveraged, in 2010, primarily due to planned incremental investments in technology and infrastructure related to our E Commerce business. Distribution costs, which are included in SG&A, totaled $187 million for 2010, $168 million for 2009 and $166 million for 2008. Net revenues from the credit card program also deleveraged in 2010 due to reductions in late fee revenue as a result of legislative changes. In connection with the April 2006 sale of our proprietary credit card accounts to JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPMorgan Chase), we entered into a service and revenue sharing agreement. Pursuant to this agreement, JPMorgan Chase issues Kohls branded private label credit cards to new and existing Kohls customers. Since we do not own the receivables, the receivables and the related allowance for bad debt reserve are not reported on our balance sheets. Risk management decisions are jointly managed by JPMorgan Chase and us. We handle all customer service functions and are responsible for all advertising and marketing related to credit card customers and the majority of the associated expenses. Net revenues of the program are shared with JPMorgan Chase according to a fixed percentage and are settled monthly. Net revenues include finance charge and late fee revenues, less write offs of uncollectible accounts and other expenses. In August 2010, we entered into a Private Label Credit Card Program Agreement with Capital One, National Association (Capital One), which will be effective upon transition of the outstanding receivables from JPMorgan Chase to Capital One. We currently expect this transition to happen in the first fiscal quarter of 2011. Kohls and Capital One will share in the net risk adjusted revenue of the portfolio as defined by the sum of finance charges, late fees and other revenue less write offs of uncollectible accounts. Changes in funding costs related to interest rate fluctuations will be shared similar to the revenue. Though management currently believes that increases in funding costs will be largely offset by increases in finance charge revenue, increases in funding costs could adversely impact the profitability of this program. SG&A for 2009 increased $182 million, or 5%, over 2008. SG&A increased primarily due to store growth and increased incentive compensation and changes made to our non management compensation structure. Depreciation and amortization. 2010 2009 2008 (Dollars in millions) (Restated) Depreciation and amortization $ 750 $ 688 $ 632 The increases in depreciation and amortization are primarily due to the addition of new stores and remodels. 22 Table of Contents Operating income. 2010 2009 2008 (Dollars in millions) (Restated) Operating income $ 2,092 $ 1,859 $ 1,654 As a percent of net sales 11.4 % 10.8 % 10.1 % The changes in operating income and operating income as a percent of net sales are due to the factors discussed above. Interest expense. 2010 2009 2008 (Dollars in millions) (Restated) Interest expense, net $ 304 $ 301 $ 275 Net interest expense for 2010 increased $3 million over 2009. Net interest expense for 2009 increased $26 million over 2008. The increases are primarily attributable to interest on new financing obligations related to new stores. The increase in 2009 was also attributable to lower interest income due to lower interest rates on our investments which were partially offset by higher average investments and a reduction in capitalized interest due to lower capital expenditures in 2009. Income taxes. 2010 2009 2008 (Dollars in millions) (Restated) Provision for income taxes $ 668 $ 585 $ 522 Effective tax rate 37.4 % 37.5 % 37.8 % The effective tax rate for 2010 was comparable to the 2009 and 2008 tax rates. Inflation Although we expect that our operations will be influenced by general economic conditions, including rising food, fuel and energy prices, we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations. However, there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by such factors in the future. We are beginning to experience inflation in our merchandise, raw material, labor and fuel costs. Such cost increases were not significant in 2010, but we do expect to see low to mid single digit cost increases in the first six months of 2011 and low double digit increases in the last six months of 2011. In our private and exclusive brands, where we have more control over the production and manufacture of the merchandise, we have historically been able to minimize inflationary pressures through measures such as committing earlier for fabric and certain other raw materials and shifting production to lower cost markets. Our third party brand vendors are also facing the same inflationary pressures. We will continue to work with these vendors in our efforts to minimize the impact of inflation on our merchandise costs and our selling prices. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary ongoing cash requirements are for capital expenditures in connection with our expansion and remodeling programs and seasonal and new store inventory purchases. Our primary sources of funds are cash flow provided by operations, short term trade credit and our lines of credit. Short term trade credit, in the form of extended payment terms for inventory purchases, often represents a significant source of financing for merchandise inventories. Seasonal cash needs may be met by cash on hand and or the line of credit available under our revolving credit facility. Our working capital and inventory levels typically build throughout the fall, peaking during the November and December holiday selling season. We anticipate that we will be able to satisfy our working capital requirements, planned capital expenditures, dividend payments and debt service requirements with available cash and cash equivalents, proceeds from cash flows from operations, short term trade credit, seasonal borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other sources of financing. We expect to generate adequate cash flow from operating activities to sustain current levels of operations. 23 Table of Contents As of January 29, 2011, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.3 billion. We generated $900 million of free cash flow in 2010 and expect to generate $1 billion in 2011. (See the Free Cash Flow discussion later in this Liquidity and Capital Resources section for additional discussion of free cash flow, a non GAAP financial measure.) 2010 2009 2008 (Dollars in millions) (Restated) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,756 $ 2,286 $ 1,752 Investing activities (757 ) (649 ) (1,015 ) Financing activities (989 ) (13 ) (275 ) Operating activities. Cash provided by operations decreased 23% in 2010 to $1.8 billion. At January 29, 2011, total merchandise inventories increased $113 million, or 4%, from year end 2009. On a dollars per store basis, merchandise inventories at January 29, 2011 increased 0.9% from year end 2009. Clearance inventory units per store are down approximately 12%. These changes reflect our various inventory management initiatives, including our conservative sales and receipt planning and lower clearance levels. Accounts payable at January 29, 2011 decreased $50 million from year end 2009, compared to increasing $306 million from year end 2008 to 2009. The change is primarily due to vendor finance initiatives which are now fully implemented. In prior years, we rolled out a receivable financing program whereby a financial institution provides our vendors with financing, at a rate which is below what the vendors could normally obtain on their own. We offer this program to vendors in exchange for extended payment terms. We do not incur any costs or expenses or forfeit any portion of our receivables in connection with this program. Timing of inventory purchases also contributed to the change. Accounts payable as a percent of inventory was 37.5% at January 29, 2011, compared to 40.6% at year end 2009. It has been more than a year since we implemented our vendor finance initiatives, so we no longer expect to see the significant improvement in this metric that we have seen in the past. Lower inventory turn also contributed to the decrease. Cash provided by operations increased 30% over 2008 to $2.3 billion in 2009, primarily due to a $258 million increase in cash flows from accounts payable activities. Accounts payable at January 30, 2010 increased $306 million from year end 2008. Accounts payable as a percent of inventory was 40.6% at January 30, 2010, compared to 31.5% at year end 2008, primarily due to strong inventory management, our cycle time reduction initiatives and improved vendor financing management. Short term trade credit, in the form of extended payment terms for inventory purchases, represents a significant source of financing for merchandise inventories. Compared to year end 2008, total merchandise inventories at January 30, 2010 increased 4% and inventory per store decreased 0.9%. Clearance inventory units per store were down approximately 14%. These reductions were the result of inventory management initiatives, including our conservative sales and receipt planning and lower clearance levels. Investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities increased $108 million to $757 million in 2010, primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures. Capital expenditures totaled $801 million for 2010, a $126 million increase over 2009. This increase is primarily due to higher capital spending as a result of increased remodels, the opening of our second E Commerce fulfillment center and planned incremental IT investments to support our E Commerce business. These increases were partially offset by reductions in capital spending for new stores. 24 Table of Contents Capital expenditures by major category were as follows: (Restated) 2011Estimate 2010 2009 2008 New stores 29 % 28 % 55 % 69 % Remodels/relocations 25 30 15 11 Distribution centers 13 10 4 Capitalized software 15 12 8 5 Fixtures and store improvements 12 12 9 4 Other 6 8 13 7 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % We expect total capital expenditures of approximately $1 billion in fiscal 2011 due primarily to an increase in new store openings (40 expected in 2011 compared to 31 in 2010). An increase in store remodels (approximately 100 expected in 2011 compared to 85 in 2010), construction of a third fulfillment center to support our E Commerce business and the roll out of electronic signs to additional stores will also contribute to the increase. The actual amount of our future capital expenditures will depend primarily on the number of new stores opened, the mix of owned, leased or acquired stores, the number of stores remodeled and the timing of distribution center openings. We do not anticipate that our expansion plans will be limited by any restrictive covenants in our financing agreements. We believe that our capital structure is well positioned to support our expansion plans. We anticipate that internally generated cash flows will be the primary source of funding for future growth. Sales of long term investments generated cash of $42 million in 2010 and $28 million in 2009. As of January 29, 2011, we had investments in auction rate securities (ARS) with a par value of $337 million and an estimated fair value of $276 million. ARS are long term debt instruments with interest rates reset through periodic short term auctions, which are typically held every 35 days. Beginning in February 2008, liquidity issues in the global credit markets resulted in the failure of auctions for all of our ARS. A failed auction occurs when the amount of securities submitted for sale in the auction exceeds the amount of purchase bids. As a result, holders are unable to liquidate their investment through the auction. A failed auction is not a default of the debt instrument, but does set a new interest rate in accordance with the terms of the debt instrument. A failed auction limits liquidity for holders until there is a successful auction or until such time as another market for ARS develops. ARS are generally callable by the issuer at any time. Scheduled auctions continue to be held until the ARS matures or is called. To date, we have collected all interest payable on outstanding ARS when due and expect to continue to do so in the future. Substantially all redemptions to date were made at par. At this time, we have no reason to believe that any of the underlying issuers of our ARS or their insurers are presently at risk or that the reduced liquidity has had a significant impact on the underlying credit quality of the assets backing our ARS. While the auction failures limit our ability to liquidate these investments, we believe that the ARS failures will have no significant impact on our ability to fund ongoing operations and growth initiatives. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $366 million to $649 million in 2009, primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures. Capital expenditures totaled $675 million for 2009, a $391 million decrease from 2008. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the number of new store openings from 75 in 2008 to 56 in 2009. Financing activities. Our financing activities used cash of $989 million in 2010 and $13 million in 2009. The change is primarily due to treasury stock purchases in the fourth quarter of 2010. On November 17, 2010, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase transaction with Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated (Morgan Stanley) to repurchase $1.0 billion of Kohls common stock on an accelerated basis. This accelerated share repurchase was part of the $2.5 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in September 2007. On November 18, 2010, we paid $1.0 billion to Morgan Stanley from cash on hand. We received a total of 18.8 million shares under the program: 12.6 million shares on November 18, 2010, 3.8 million shares on December 7, 2010, 1.5 million on January 11, 2011, and a final delivery of 0.9 million shares on March 3, 2011. The total number of shares received was generally determined by the discounted average of the daily volume weighted average price of shares traded during the relevant pricing periods. We have $300 million of long term debt which was due in March 2011 and $100 million of long term debt which is due in October 2011. We expect to replace this debt in the second half of 2011. In anticipation of the debt refinancing, we entered into an interest rate swap in December 2010 to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk on the first $200 million of debt issued. Amounts related to this financial instrument were not material. We also expect to refinance our $900 million senior unsecured revolving facility which will expire in October 2011. 25 Table of Contents In February 2011, our Board of Directors approved our first ever dividend. The 25 cent per share quarterly dividend will be paid on March 30, 2011 to all shareholders of record as of March 9, 2011. The dividend reflects the Boards confidence in our long term cash flow. We expect to use a portion of future free cash flow to continue to pay quarterly dividends. Our Board of Directors also increased the remaining share repurchase authorization under our existing share repurchase program by $2.6 billion, from $900 million to $3.5 billion. We expect to execute the share repurchase program primarily in open market transactions, subject to market conditions and to complete the program by the end of Fiscal 2013. Our credit ratings have been unchanged since September 2007 when we issued $1 billion in debt. Our ratings are currently as follows: Moodys Standard & Poors Fitch Long term debt Baa1 BBB+ BBB+ We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through open market cash purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved could be material. Our financing activities used cash of $13 million in 2009 and $275 million in 2008. The change is primarily due to treasury stock purchases in the first six months of 2008. Key financial ratios. Key financial ratios that provide certain measures of our liquidity are as follows: 2010 2009 2008 (Restated) Working capital (In Millions) $ 2,861 $ 3,030 $ 1,828 Current ratio 2.03:1 2.23:1 1.96:1 Debt/capitalization 33.7 % 34.2 % 36.9 % Ratio of earnings to fixed charges 4.6 4.2 4.1 Return on gross investment* 19.2 % 18.2 % 17.3 % * Return on gross investment is a non GAAP financial measure. The decrease in working capital and the current ratio as of year end 2010 compared to year end 2009 was primarily due to the reclassification of $400 million of debt maturing in 2011 from long term to short term and the $1.0 billion purchase of Kohls common stock pursuant to the accelerated stock repurchase program. The debt/capitalization ratio was comparable to 2009, as share repurchases offset earnings in equity. The increase in the 2010 ratio of earnings to fixed charges was primarily due to higher earnings. See Exhibit 12.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10 K/A for the calculation of this ratio. The increase in working capital and the current ratio as of year end 2009 compared to year end 2008 was primarily due to higher cash and cash equivalents. The decrease in the debt/capitalization ratio reflects higher capitalization, primarily due to earnings. The increase in the 2009 ratio of earnings to fixed charges over 2008 was primarily due to higher earnings. The increases in our Return on Gross Investment (ROI) were primarily due to higher earnings. ROI is a non GAAP financial measure which we define as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent (EBITDAR) divided by average gross investment. Our ROI calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. ROI should be evaluated in addition to, and not considered a substitute for, other financial measures such as return on assets. We believe that ROI measures how effectively we utilize our assets, excluding cash equivalents and long term investments, to generate earnings. 26 Table of Contents The following table includes our ROI and return on assets (the most comparable GAAP measure) calculations: 2010 2009 2008 (Dollar in millions) (Restated) Net income $ 1,120 $ 973 $ 857 Rent expense 264 253 240 Depreciation and amortization 750 688 632 Net interest 304 301 275 Provision for income taxes 668 585 522 EBITDAR $ 3,106 $ 2,800 $ 2,526 Average: Total assets (1) $ 14,989 $ 13,527 $ 12,192 Cash equivalents and long term investments(2,3) (2,472 ) (1,434 ) (513 ) Deferred tax assets (2) (86 ) (72 ) (71 ) Accumulated depreciation (1) 3,948 3,367 2,852 Capitalized rent (4) 2,546 2,451 2,318 Accounts payable (2) (1,441 ) (1,259 ) (1,066 ) Accrued liabilities (1) (973 ) (924 ) (829 ) Other long term liabilities (1) (357 ) (313 ) (267 ) Gross Investment (AGI) $ 16,154 $ 15,343 $ 14,616 Return on Assets (ROA) (5) 7.5 % 7.2 % 7.0 % Return on Gross Investment (ROI) (6) 19.2 % 18.2 % 17.3 % (1) Represents average of 5 most recent quarter end balances for 2010 and 2 most recent year end balances for 2009 and 2008 (2) Represents average of 5 most recent quarter end balances for all periods (3) Represents excess cash not required for operations (4) Represents 10 times store rent expense and 5 times equipment/other rent (5) Net income divided by Average total assets (6) EBITDAR divided by Gross Investment 27 Table of Contents Debt Covenant Compliance.

Free Cash Flow. We generated free cash flow of approximately $900 million in 2010 and $1.6 billion in 2009. The decrease in free cash flow is primarily a result of lower cash provided by operating activities, as discussed above. Free cash flow is a non GAAP financial measure which we define as net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from financing obligations (which generally represent landlord reimbursements of construction costs) less capital expenditures and capital lease and financing obligation payments. Free cash flow should be evaluated in addition to, and not considered a substitute for, other financial measures such as net income and cash flow provided by operations. We believe that free cash flow represents our ability to generate additional cash flow from our business operations. The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities (a GAAP measure) to free cash flow (a non GAAP measure). 2010 2009 2008 (Dollars in millions) (Restated) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,756 $ 2,286 $ 1,752 Acquisition of property and equipment (801 ) (675 ) (1,066 ) Capital lease and financing obligation payments (84 ) (70 ) (62 ) Proceeds from financing obligations 27 10 44 Free cash flow $ 898 $ 1,551 $ 668 We expect to generate $1 billion of free cash flow in fiscal 2011. 28 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations as of January 29, 2011 were as follows: (Restated) Total LessThan 1Year 1 3Years 3 5Years Morethan 5Years (In Millions) Recorded contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 1,900 $ 400 $ $ $ 1,500 Capital lease and financing obligations 1,678 86 164 158 1,270 3,578 486 164 158 2,770 Unrecorded contractual obligations: Interest payments: Long term debt 1,615 114 194 194 1,113 Capital lease and financing obligations 3,185 195 373 345 2,272 Operating leases (a) 6,346 233 458 457 5,198 Maintenance contracts 25 13 11 1 Royalties 429 67 143 129 90 Purchase obligations (b) 4,088 4,058 30 15,688 4,680 1,209 1,126 8,673 Total $ 19,266 $ 5,166 $ 1,373 $ 1,284 $ 11,443 (a) Our leases typically require that we pay real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs in addition to the minimum rental payments included in the table above. Such costs vary from period to period and totaled $168 million for 2010, $157 million for 2009 and $148 million for 2008. The lease term includes cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty. (b) Our purchase obligations consist mainly of purchase orders for merchandise. Amounts committed under open purchase orders for merchandise are cancelable without penalty prior to a date that precedes the vendors scheduled shipment date. It is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax positions may change within the next 12 months, primarily as a result of ongoing audits. While it is possible that one or more of these audits may be resolved in the next year, it is not anticipated that payment of any such amounts in future periods will materially affect liquidity and cash flows. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not provided any financial guarantees as of year end 2010. We have not created, and are not party to, any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating our business. We do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. A discussion of the more significant estimates follows. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Retail Inventory Method and Inventory Valuation We value our inventory at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on the first in, first out (FIFO) basis using the retail inventory method (RIM). RIM is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality. Under RIM, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail value of the inventories. The use of RIM will result in inventories being valued at the lower of cost or market as markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories. Based on a review of historical clearance markdowns, current business trends, expected vendor funding and discontinued merchandise categories, an adjustment to inventory is recorded to reflect additional markdowns which are estimated to be necessary to liquidate existing clearance inventories and reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market. Management believes that our inventory valuation approximates the net realizable value of clearance inventory and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market. 29 Table of Contents Vendor Allowances We record vendor allowances and discounts in the income statement when the purpose for which those monies were designated is fulfilled. Allowances provided by vendors generally relate to profitability of inventory recently sold and, accordingly, are reflected as reductions to cost of merchandise sold as negotiated. Vendor allowances received for advertising or fixture programs reduce our expense or expenditure for the related advertising or fixture program when appropriate. Vendor allowances will fluctuate based on the amount of promotional and clearance markdowns necessary to liquidate the inventory. See also Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, Business and Summary of Accounting Policies. Insurance Reserve Estimates We use a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation, general liability and employee related health care benefits, a portion of which is paid by our associates. We use a third party actuary, which considers historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions, to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks. A change in claims frequency and severity of claims from historical experience as well as changes in state statutes and the mix of states in which we operate could result in a change to the required reserve levels. We retain the initial risk of $500,000 per occurrence under our workers compensation insurance policy and $250,000 per occurrence under our general liability policy. The lifetime medical payment limit of $1.5 million per plan participant was eliminated on December 31, 2010. Impairment of Assets and Closed Store Reserves We have a significant investment in property and equipment. The related depreciation and amortization is computed using estimated useful lives of up to 40 years. We review our long lived assets held for use for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances, such as decisions to close a store, indicates the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. We have historically not experienced any significant impairment of long lived assets or closed store reserves. Decisions to close a store can also result in accelerated depreciation over the revised useful life. When operations at a leased store are discontinued, a reserve is established for the discounted difference between the rent and the expected sublease rental income. A significant change in cash flows, market valuation, demand for real estate or other factors, could result in an increase or decrease in the reserve requirement or impairment charge. Income Taxes We pay income taxes based on tax statutes, regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various taxing authorities. Our effective income tax rate was 37.4% in 2010, 37.5% in 2009 and 37.8% in 2008. The effective rate is impacted by changes in law, location of new stores, level of earnings and the result of tax audits. Property Leases As of January 29, 2011, 707 of our 1,089 retail stores were subject to either a ground or building lease. Accounting for leased properties requires compliance with technical accounting rules and significant judgment by management. Application of these accounting rules and assumptions made by management will determine whether we are considered the owner for accounting purposes or whether the lease is accounted for as a capital or operating lease in accordance with ASC 840, Leases. If we are considered the owner for accounting purposes or the lease is considered a capital lease, we record the property and a related financing or capital lease obligation on our balance sheet. The asset is then depreciated over its expected lease term. Rent payments for these properties are recognized as interest expense and a reduction of the financing or capital lease obligation. If the lease is considered an operating lease, it is not recorded on our balance sheet and rent expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the expected lease term. The most significant estimates used by management in accounting for property leases and the impact of these estimates are as follows: Expected lease term Our expected lease term includes both contractual lease periods and cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty. The expected lease term is used in determining whether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or a capital lease. A lease is considered a capital lease if the lease term exceeds 75% of the leased assets useful life. The expected lease term is also used in determining the depreciable life of the asset or the straight line rent recognition period. Increasing the expected lease term will increase the probability that a lease will be considered a capital lease and will generally result in higher rent expense for an operating lease and higher interest and depreciation expenses for a leased property recorded on our balance sheet. 30 Table of Contents Incremental borrowing rate We estimate our incremental borrowing rate using treasury rates for debt with maturities comparable to the expected lease term and our credit spread. The incremental borrowing rate is primarily used in determining whether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or a capital lease. A lease is considered a capital lease if the net present value of the lease payments is greater than 90% of the fair market value of the property. Increasing the incremental borrowing rate decreases the net present value of the lease payments and reduces the probability that a lease will be considered a capital lease. For leases which are recorded on our balance sheet with a related capital lease or financing obligation, the incremental borrowing rate is also used in allocating our rental payments between interest expense and a reduction of the outstanding obligation. Fair market value of leased asset The fair market value of leased retail property is generally estimated based on comparable market data or consideration received from the landlord. Fair market value is used in determining whether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or a capital lease. A lease is considered a capital lease if the net present value of the lease payments is greater than 90% of the fair market value of the property. Increasing the fair market value reduces the probability that a lease will be considered a capital lease. Fair market value is also used in determining the amount of property and related financing obligation to be recognized on our balance sheet for certain leased properties which are considered owned for accounting purposes. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk All of our long term debt at year end 2010 is at fixed interest rates and, therefore, is not affected by changes in interest rates. When our long term debt instruments mature, we may refinance them at then existing market interest rates, which may be more or less than interest rates on the maturing debt. Cash equivalents and long term investments earn interest at variable rates and are affected by changes in interest rates. During 2010, average investments were $2.7 billion and average yield was 0.3%. If interest rates on the average 2010 variable rate cash equivalents and long term investments increased by 100 basis points, our annual interest income would also increase by approximately $27 million assuming comparable investment levels. We entered into an interest rate swap in December 2010 to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk on the first $200 million of debt that we expect to issue in 2011. Amounts related to this financial instrument were not material and we were not a party to any other material derivative financial instruments in 2010, 2009 or 2008.
