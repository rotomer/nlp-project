Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary Total net sales for 2011 were $18.8 billion, a 2.2% increase over 2010. Comparable store sales increased 0.5% over 2010. Comparable sales were driven by a 6.6% increase in average unit retail price, which was largely offset by decreases in units per transaction and number of transactions. Our E Commerce business met its $1 billion revenue goal for the year and contributed 150 basis points to the comparable store sales increase. The Northeast region and the Accessories and Home businesses reported the strongest comparable store sales growth. Gross margin was essentially flat to 2010 at 38.2% of sales for 2011. We successfully managed apparel cost inflation throughout the year, but saw lower margins during the fourth quarter holiday season due to the extremely competitive landscape and sales which were below our expectations. Expense management contributed to a 4% increase in net income and a 17% increase in diluted earnings per share. For 2011, net income was $1.2 billion, or $4.30 per diluted share, compared to $1.1 billion, or $3.66 per diluted share for 2010. We increased our free cash flow (a non GAAP financial measure which is defined in Liquidity and Capital Resources) by 27% to $1.1 billion and returned approximately $2.6 billion to shareholders in 2011 with our first ever quarterly dividends and with share repurchases. We ended the year with 1,127 stores in 49 states, including 40 which were successfully opened in 2011. We also completed 100 remodels in 2011. As of year end, approximately one half of our stores were either new or remodeled in the last five years. We believe this is a critical element in creating a positive shopping experience and driving increased sales. 2012 Outlook During 2011, we experienced 10 15% increases in apparel costs and were aggressive in passing these higher costs to our customers. In 2012, we expect to see modest cost increases in the first six months of the year, but to see decreases in the last six months of the year. We currently plan to be less aggressive about passing higher costs on to our customer in 2012. We expect this change to have a positive impact on our sales, but a negative impact on our gross margin rate. Our current expectations for fiscal 2012 compared to 2011 are as follows: Total sales Increase 4.5% Comparable store sales Increase 2% Gross margin as a percent of sales Decrease 70 bp SG&A Increase 3% Earnings per diluted share $4.75 Fiscal 2012 is a 53 week year. Excluding the impact of the 53rd week, we expect total sales to increase 3.5%, SG&A to increase 2% and earnings per diluted share to be $4.65. Our guidance assumes share repurchases of $1 billion at an average price of $55 per share. 19 We expect to open approximately 20 new stores in 2012. Substantially all of the stores will be small stores with less than 64,000 square feet of retail space. We are temporarily reducing the number of remodels to approximately 50 stores in 2012 as we look at potential changes to our store layout to increase sales productivity and operational efficiency. Results of Operations Net sales. 2011 2010 2009 Net sales (In Millions) $ 18,804 $ 18,391 $ 17,178 Sales growth: Total 2.2 % 7.1 % 4.8 % Comparable stores (a) 0.5 % 4.4 % 0.4 % Net sales per selling square foot (b) $ 220 $ 222 $ 217 (a) Includes sales for stores (including relocated or remodeled stores) which were open throughout both the full current and prior year periods and E Commerce. (b) Net sales per selling square foot is based on stores open for the full current period, excluding E Commerce. The changes in net sales were due to the following: 2011 2010 2009 (Dollars in Millions) Comparable store sales: $ % $ % $ % Stores $ (175 ) (1.0 )% $ 500 3.1 % $ (62 ) (0.4 )% E Commerce (a) 267 37.2 244 51.7 132 38.7 Total 92 0.5 744 4.4 70 0.4 Sales from new stores and other revenues 321 469 719 Increase in net sales $ 413 2.2 % $ 1,213 7.1 % $ 789 4.8% (a) Excludes shipping and other revenues Drivers of the changes in comparable store sales were as follows: 2011 2010 2009 Selling price per unit 6.6 % (1.5 )% 2.3% Units per transaction (4.9 ) (1.5 ) (4.3) Average transaction value 1.7 (3.0 ) (2.0) Number of transactions (1.2 ) 7.4 2.4 Comparable store sales 0.5 % 4.4 % 0.4% The increase in selling price per unit reflects higher sales prices as we were more aggressive in passing higher apparel costs on to our customers. As a result of these price increases there was some resistance from our customers in both units per transaction and number of transactions per store. 20 The Northeast region reported the strongest 2011 sales growth with comparable store sales increases in the low single digits. All other regions reported comparable store sales decreases of one to three percent for the year. E Commerce revenue, which includes shipping and other revenues, reached $1 billion in 2011. This represents a $269 million increase over 2010 E commerce revenue of $743 million. The number of E Commerce transactions increased almost 42% due to increased customer traffic, increased style and size selections offered on line compared with our in store selection and the expansion of product categories not available in our stores. By line of business, Accessories and Home provided the strongest comparable store sales growth for the year. Accessories was led by strength in watches and Home was led by electrics. Childrens and Mens both outperformed the Company average. Mens saw growth in dress shirts and basics and Childrens was led by toys. Womens had positive comparable store growth on strength in active and updated sportswear. Footwear recorded a low single digit comparable store decrease for the year. Womens shoes performed well with low double digit comparable store sales growth, however, athletic shoes reported a low double digit comparable store sales decline. Net sales per selling square foot, which is based on stores open for the full current period, excluding E Commerce, decreased $2 to $220 in 2011. The decrease is primarily due to a one percent decrease in sales at our comparable stores. Net sales for 2010 increased 7.1% over 2009 and comparable store sales increased 4.4%. From a line of business perspective, Footwear reported the strongest comparable store sales in 2010 with strength in womens and juniors shoes. Mens and Home outperformed the Company average for the year, while Accessories and Childrens trailed the Company average. Womens was similar to the Company average. The Southeast region reported the strongest comparable store sales for 2010. In 2010, the Southeast region benefited from implementing merchandising and marketing tactics similar to those that were implemented in the West region in 2009. E Commerce revenue, which includes shipping and other revenues, increased $252 million to $743 million for 2010. Gross margin. 2011 2010 2009 (Dollars in Millions) Gross margin $ 7,179 $ 7,032 $ 6,498 As a percent of net sales 38.2 % 38.2 % 37.8 % Gross margin includes the total cost of products sold, including product development costs, net of vendor payments other than reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs; inventory shrink; markdowns; freight expenses associated with moving merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers; shipping and handling expenses of E Commerce sales; and terms cash discount. Our gross margin may not be comparable with that of other retailers because we include distribution center costs in selling, general and administrative expenses while other retailers may include these expenses in cost of merchandise sold. Gross margin increased $147 million, or 2%, in 2011 compared to 2010. Gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased 6 basis points to 38.2 % for 2011. Inventory management, increased penetration of private and exclusive brands (which have a higher gross margin rate than national brands) and ongoing markdown and size optimization initiatives all had a favorable impact on our gross margin rate. During 2011, we successfully managed apparel cost inflation throughout the year, but saw lower gross margin during the fourth quarter holiday season due to the extremely competitive landscape and sales which were below our expectations. Our E Commerce business decreased our gross margin rate by approximately 70 basis points. This business currently has a lower gross margin than our stores due to the mix of products sold on line and free or reduced cost shipping promotions. 21 Gross margin for 2010 increased $534 million, or 8%, over 2009. The 41 basis point improvement in gross margin as a percent of net sales for 2010 compared to 2009 was driven by strong inventory management and increased penetration of private and exclusive brands. Sales of private and exclusive brands reached 48% of net sales in 2010, an increase of approximately 290 basis points over 2009. Selling, general and administrative expenses. 2011 2010 2009 (Dollars in Millions) Selling, general, and administrative expenses $ 4,243 $ 4,190 $ 3,951 As a percent of net sales 22.6 % 22.8 % 23.0 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) include compensation and benefit costs (including stores, headquarters, buying and merchandising and distribution centers); occupancy and operating costs of our retail, distribution and corporate facilities; freight expenses associated with moving merchandise from our distribution centers to our retail stores and among distribution and retail facilities; advertising expenses, offset by vendor payments for reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs; net revenues from our Kohls credit card operations; and other administrative costs. SG&A also includes the costs incurred prior to new store openings, such as advertising, hiring and training costs for new employees, processing and transporting initial merchandise, and rent expense. We do not include depreciation and amortization in SG&A. The classification of these expenses varies across the retail industry. SG&A for 2011 increased $53 million, or 1%, over 2010, but decreased as a percentage of net sales, or leveraged. SG&A increased primarily due to store growth, increased advertising, and investments in technology and infrastructure related to our E Commerce business. Hourly store payroll costs leveraged in 2011 and continues to be driven by sustainable productivity improvements, such as the continued rollout of electronic signs. As of year end, 475 stores were equipped with electronic signs. Advertising increased as a percentage of net sales, or deleveraged, in 2011, primarily due to increased spending during a very promotional holiday season and incremental spending to support the Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony brand launches. Distribution costs, which are included in SG&A, totaled $202 million for 2011, $187 million for 2010 and $168 million for 2009. The increase in 2011 is primarily due to growth in our E Commerce business. On April 1, 2011, we commenced a seven year private label credit card program agreement with Capital One, National Association (Capital One). Pursuant to this agreement, Capital One offers private label credit cards to new and existing customers of Kohls. We handle all customer service functions, including processing billings, collecting on accounts, responding to customer inquiries, and maintaining data systems. We are also responsible for all advertising and marketing related to our credit card customers. Kohls and Capital One share in the net risk adjusted revenue of the portfolio as defined by the sum of finance charges, late fees and other revenue less write offs of uncollectible accounts. Unlike the previous program agreement, we also share the costs of funding the outstanding receivables if interest rates were to exceed defined rates. While we currently believe that increases in funding costs would be largely offset by increases in finance charge revenue, the profitability of our credit card program may be impacted by changes in interest rates. Revenues from our credit card operations, net of the expenses to provide the functions detailed above, were $347 million in 2011, $180 million in 2010 and $252 million in 2009. The increase in 2011 compared to 2010 represents higher revenues as a result of higher finance charges due to receivable growth, higher late fees due to regulatory changes which reduced late fees in 2010, and lower receivable write offs due to improved delinquency rates. A more favorable revenue sharing percentage under the current Capital One agreement also contributed to the increase. The decrease in 2010 compared to 2009 reflects lower late fees due to regulatory changes and higher receivable write offs due to higher delinquency rates, partially offset by higher finance charges due to receivable growth. 22 SG&A for 2010 increased $239 million, or 6%, over 2009, but decreased as a percentage of net sales. SG&A increased primarily due to store growth, higher sales, and investments in technology and infrastructure related to our E Commerce business. Depreciation and amortization. 2011 2010 2009 (In Millions) Depreciation and amortization $ 778 $ 750 $ 688 The increases in depreciation and amortization are primarily due to the addition of new stores, remodels and the opening of our third E Commerce fulfillment center in Edgewood, Maryland. Operating income. 2011 2010 2009 (Dollars in Millions) Operating income $ 2,158 $ 2,092 $ 1,859 As a percent of net sales 11.5 % 11.4 % 10.8 % The changes in operating income and operating income as a percent of net sales are due to the factors discussed above. Interest expense. 2011 2010 2009 (In Millions) Interest expense, net $ 299 $ 304 $ 301 Net interest expense for 2011 decreased $5 million, or 2%, from 2010. The decrease is attributable to the repayment of debt totaling $400 million in March and October 2011 and the subsequent issuance of $650 million of debt in October 2011 at a lower interest rate. Net interest expense for 2010 increased $3 million over 2009. The increase was primarily attributed to interest on new financing obligations related to new stores. Income taxes. 2011 2010 2009 (Dollars in Millions) Provision for income taxes $ 692 $ 668 $ 585 Effective tax rate 37.2 % 37.4 % 37.5 % The effective tax rate for 2011 was comparable to the 2010 and 2009 tax rates. Inflation Although we expect that our operations will be influenced by general economic conditions, including rising food, fuel and energy prices, we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations. However, there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by such factors in the future. We experienced 10 15% increases in apparel costs in 2011. We expect to see modest increases in the first six months of 2012, but to see decreases in the last six months of the year. 23 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary ongoing cash requirements are for capital expenditures in connection with our expansion and remodeling programs and seasonal and new store inventory purchases. Share repurchases and dividend payments to shareholders are currently another significant usage of cash. These payments are discretionary and can be discontinued at any time should we require cash for other uses. Our primary sources of funds are cash flow provided by operations, short term trade credit and our lines of credit. Short term trade credit, in the form of extended payment terms for inventory purchases, often represents a significant source of financing for merchandise inventories. Seasonal cash needs may be met by cash on hand and or the line of credit available under our revolving credit facility. Our working capital and inventory levels typically build throughout the fall, peaking during the November and December holiday selling season. As of January 28, 2012, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.2 billion. We generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow in 2011. (See the Free Cash Flow discussion later in this Liquidity and Capital Resources section for additional discussion of this non GAAP financial measure.) 2011 2010 2009 (Dollars in Millions) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 2,143 $ 1,756 $ 2,286 Investing activities (802 ) (757 ) (649 ) Financing activities (2,413 ) (989 ) (13 ) Operating activities. Cash provided by operations increased 22% in 2011 to $2.1 billion. Total merchandise inventories at January 28, 2012 were $163 million, or 5%, higher than year end 2010. On a per store basis, merchandise inventories at January 28, 2012 increased 2% in dollars over year end 2010, but decreased 7% in units. The decrease in units per store reflects our various inventory management initiatives, including our conservative sales and receipt planning and lower clearance levels. The increase in dollars per store reflects higher merchandise costs over 2010. Accounts payable at January 28, 2012 increased $95 million over year end 2010. The increase is primarily due to expiration of vendor financing initiatives. Timing of inventory purchases also contributed to the change. Accounts payable as a percent of inventory was 38.5% at January 28, 2012, compared to 37.5% at year end 2010. The increase is primarily due to higher accounts payable balances with some vendors over year end 2010, due to timing of when these vendors required payment. Cash provided by operations decreased $530 million from $2.3 billion in 2009 to $1.8 billion in 2010. The decrease was primarily due to a $356 million decrease in cash flows from accounts payable activities. Accounts payable at January 29, 2011 decreased $50 million from year end 2009. Accounts payable as a percent of inventory was 37.5% at January 29, 2011, compared to 40.6% at year end 2009. The change is primarily due to vendor finance initiatives which were fully implemented at year end 2010. In prior years, we rolled out a receivable financing program whereby a financial institution provides our vendors with financing, at a rate which is below what the vendors could normally obtain on their own. We offer this program to vendors in exchange for extended payment terms. We do not incur any costs or expenses or forfeit any portion of our receivables in connection with this program. Timing of inventory purchases also contributed to the change. 24 Investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities increased $45 million to $802 million in 2011, primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures. Capital expenditures totaled $927 million for 2011, a $126 million increase over 2010. This increase is primarily due to higher capital spending for new stores, remodels, our third E Commerce fulfillment center and a call center in Texas. Capital expenditures by major category were as follows: 2012Estimate 2011 2010 2009 New stores 21 % 27 % 28 % 55 % Remodels/relocations 17 26 30 15 Distribution centers 16 15 10 Computer hardware and software 24 18 17 11 Fixtures and store improvements 14 7 12 9 Other 8 7 3 10 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % We expect total capital expenditures of approximately $825 million in fiscal 2012. The decrease from 2011 is primarily due to a decrease in new store openings (approximately 20 expected in 2012 compared to 40 in 2011) and a decrease in store remodels (approximately 50 expected in 2012 compared to 100 in 2011). We expect to incur capital expenditures for construction of a fourth fulfillment center to support our E Commerce business in fiscal 2012. The spending on this project should be consistent with what was incurred in fiscal 2011 for the construction of our third fulfillment center. The actual amount of our future capital expenditures will depend primarily on the number and timing of new stores, distribution centers and E Commerce fulfillment centers opened; the mix of owned, leased or acquired stores; and the number of stores remodeled. We do not anticipate that our expansion plans will be limited by any restrictive covenants in our financing agreements. Sales of long term investments generated cash of $145 million in 2011 and $42 million in 2010. As of January 28, 2012, we had investments in auction rate securities (ARS) with a par value of $192 million and an estimated fair value of $152 million. Since 2008, the market for ARS has diminished. This has limited our ability to liquidate these investments, but we do not believe that it will have a significant impact on our ability to fund ongoing operations and growth initiatives. To date, we have collected all interest payable on outstanding ARS when due and expect to continue to do so in the future. Substantially all redemptions to date were made at par. Net cash used in investing activities increased $108 million to $757 million in 2010, primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures. Capital expenditures totaled $801 million for 2010, a $126 million increase over 2009. This increase is primarily due to higher capital spending as a result of increased remodels, the opening of our second E Commerce fulfillment center and planned incremental IT investments to support our E Commerce business. These increases were partially offset by reductions in capital spending for new stores. Financing activities. Our financing activities used cash of $2.4 billion in 2011 and $989 million in 2010. The increase is primarily due to increased treasury stock purchases in 2011. We repurchased 46 million shares of our common stock for approximately $2.3 billion in 2011. The shares were purchased as part of our $3.5 billion share repurchase program. Pursuant to this program, we may repurchase shares from time to time in open market transactions, accelerated stock repurchase programs, tender offers, privately negotiated transactions or by other means. Subject to market conditions, we expect to complete the program by the end of Fiscal 2013. 25 We repaid long term debt of $300 million in March 2011 and $100 million in October 2011. In October 2011, we issued $650 million of 4.00% notes with semi annual interest payments beginning May 2012. The notes mature on November 1, 2021 and have an effective interest rate of 4.8%. In conjunction with the debt issuance, we paid $48 million to settle interest rate hedges which were entered into in December 2010 and May 2011 in anticipation of the October debt issuance. We have various facilities upon which we may draw funds, including a 5 year, $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility which we entered into in June 2011. The co leads of this facility, Bank of America, U.S. Bank, and Wells Fargo Bank, have each committed $110 million. The remaining 13 lenders have each committed between $30 and $85 million. The $1 billion facility replaced a $900 million facility which was scheduled to expire in October 2011. We also have a demand note with availability of $30 million. There were no draws on these facilities during 2011 or 2010. Our credit ratings have been unchanged since September 2007 when we issued $1 billion in debt. As of January 28, 2012, our ratings were as follows: Moodys Standard & Poors Fitch Long term debt Baa1 BBB+ BBB+ We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through open market cash purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved could be material. During 2011, we paid cash dividends of $271 million as detailed in the following table: First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Declaration date February 23, 2011 May 11, 2011 August 11, 2011 November 9, 2011 Record date March 9, 2011 June 8, 2011 September 7, 2011 December 7, 2011 Payment date March 30, 2011 June 29, 2011 September 28, 2011 December 28, 2011 Amount $0.25 per commonshare $0.25 per commonshare $0.25 per commonshare $0.25 per commonshare On February 22, 2012, our Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.32 per common share which will be paid on March 28, 2012 to shareholders of record as of March 7, 2012. Our financing activities used cash of $989 million in 2010 and $13 million in 2009. The increase is primarily due to treasury stock purchases in the fourth quarter of 2010. Key financial ratios. Key financial ratios that provide certain measures of our liquidity are as follows: 2011 2010 2009 Working capital (In Millions) $ 2,185 $ 2,861 $ 3,030 Current ratio 1.84:1 2.03:1 2.23:1 Debt/capitalization 39.5 % 33.7 % 34.2 % Ratio of earnings to fixed charges 4.8 4.6 4.2 Return on Gross Investment* 18.8 % 19.2 % 18.2 % * Return on Gross Investment is a non GAAP financial measure. 26 The decrease in working capital and the current ratio and the increase in the debt/capitalization ratio as of year end 2011 compared to year end 2010 were primarily due to the repurchase of $2.3 billion of our common stock in 2011. The net increase in our outstanding debt balances also contributed to the increase in the debt/capitalization ratio. The ratio of earnings to fixed charges was generally consistent with prior years. See Exhibit 12.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the calculation of this ratio. The decrease in working capital and the current ratio as of year end 2010 compared to year end 2009 was primarily due to the reclassification of $400 million of debt maturing in 2011 from long term to short term and the repurchase of $1.0 billion of Kohls common stock. The debt/capitalization ratio was comparable to 2009, as share repurchases offset earnings in equity. The increase in the 2010 ratio of earnings to fixed charges was primarily due to higher earnings. Our Return on Gross Investment (ROI) was 18.8% for 2011, 19.2% for 2010 and 18.2% for 2009. ROI decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 as investments in stores, distribution centers and technology increased more than profitability. The increase in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to higher earnings. ROI is a non GAAP financial measure which we define as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent (EBITDAR) divided by average gross investment. Our ROI calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. ROI should be evaluated in addition to, and not considered a substitute for, other financial measures such as return on assets. We believe that ROI measures how effectively we utilize our assets, excluding cash equivalents and long term investments, to generate earnings. The following table includes our ROI and return on assets (the most comparable GAAP measure) calculations: 2011 2010 2009 (Dollar in Millions) Net income $ 1,167 $ 1,120 $ 973 Rent expense 265 264 253 Depreciation and amortization 778 750 688 Net interest 299 304 301 Provision for income taxes 692 668 585 EBITDAR $ 3,201 $ 3,106 $ 2,800 Average: Total assets (1) $ 14,358 $ 14,989 $ 13,527 Cash equivalents and long term investments (2,3) (1,416 ) (2,472 ) (1,434 ) Deferred tax assets (2) (83 ) (86 ) (72 ) Accumulated depreciation (1) 4,440 3,948 3,367 Capitalized rent (4) 2,598 2,546 2,451 Accounts payable (2) (1,439 ) (1,441 ) (1,259 ) Accrued liabilities (1) (1,044 ) (973 ) (924 ) Other long term liabilities (1) (429 ) (370 ) (313 ) Gross Investment (AGI) $ 16,985 $ 16,141 $ 15,343 Return on Assets (ROA) (5) 8.1 % 7.5 % 7.2 % Return on Gross Investment (ROI) (6) 18.8 % 19.2 % 18.2 % (1) Represents average of 5 most recent quarter end balances for 2011 and 2010 and the 2 most recent year end balances for 2009 (2) Represents average of 5 most recent quarter end balances for all periods (3) Represents excess cash not required for operations (4) Represents 10 times store rent expense and 5 times equipment/other rent (5) Net income divided by Average total assets (6) EBITDAR divided by Gross Investment 27 Debt Covenant Compliance. Our debt agreements contain various covenants including limitations on additional indebtedness and the following leverage ratio as of January 28, 2012: (Dollars in Millions) Total Debt $ 4,253 Permitted Exclusions (9 ) Subtotal 4,244 Rent x 8 2,117 A Included Indebtedness (A) $ 6,361 Net Worth $ 6,508 Investments (accounted for under equity method) Subtotal 6,508 Included Indebtedness 6,361 B Capitalization (B) $ 12,869 Leverage Ratio (A/B) 0.49 Maximum permitted Leverage Ratio 0.70 As of January 28, 2012, we were in compliance with all debt covenants and expect to remain in compliance during fiscal 2012. Free Cash Flow. We generated free cash flow of $1.1 billion in 2011 and approximately $900 million in 2010. The increase in free cash flow is primarily a result of higher cash provided by operating activities, as discussed above. Free cash flow is a non GAAP financial measure which we define as net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from financing obligations (which generally represent landlord reimbursements of construction costs) less acquisition of property & equipment and capital lease & financing obligation payments. Free cash flow should be evaluated in addition to, and not considered a substitute for, other financial measures such as net income and cash flow provided by operating activities. We believe that free cash flow represents our ability to generate additional cash flow from our business operations. The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities (a GAAP measure) to free cash flow (a non GAAP measure). 2011 2010 2009 (Dollars in Millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,143 $ 1,756 $ 2,286 Acquisition of property & equipment (927 ) (801 ) (675 ) Capital lease & financing obligation payments (91 ) (84 ) (70 ) Proceeds from financing obligations 14 27 10 Free cash flow $ 1,139 $ 898 $ 1,551 We expect to generate $1 billion of free cash flow in fiscal 2012. 28 Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations as of January 28, 2012 were as follows: Total LessThan 1Year 1 3Years 3 5Years Morethan 5Years (In Millions) Recorded contractual obligations: Long term debt $ 2,150 $ $ $ $ 2,150 Capital lease and financing obligations 1,645 94 179 167 1,205 3,795 94 179 167 3,355 Unrecorded contractual obligations: Interest payments: Long term debt 1,762 124 246 246 1,146 Capital lease and financing obligations 3,057 193 366 338 2,160 Operating leases (a) 6,237 235 465 460 5,077 Royalties 387 72 145 110 60 Purchase obligations (b) 3,562 3,562 Other (c) 418 37 66 44 271 15,423 4,223 1,288 1,198 8,714 Total $ 19,218 $ 4,317 $ 1,467 $ 1,365 $ 12,069 (a) Our leases typically require that we pay real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs in addition to the minimum rental payments included in the table above. Such costs vary from period to period and totaled $161 million for 2011, $168 million for 2010 and $157 million for 2009. The lease term includes cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in economic penalty. (b) Our purchase obligations consist mainly of purchase orders for merchandise. Amounts committed under open purchase orders for merchandise are cancelable without penalty prior to a date that precedes the vendors scheduled shipment date. (c) Our other commitments include legally binding minimum lease and interest payments for stores opening in 2012 or later, as well as payments associated with technology agreements. We have not included $118 million of long term liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and the related interest and penalties in the contractual obligations table because we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of cash settlements. It is reasonably possible that such tax positions may change within the next 12 months, primarily as a result of ongoing audits. While it is possible that one or more of these audits may be resolved in the next year, it is not anticipated that payment of any such amounts in future periods will materially affect liquidity and cash flows. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not provided any financial guarantees as of year end 2011. We have not created, and are not party to, any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating our business. We do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or capital resources. 29 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. A discussion of the more significant estimates follows. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Retail Inventory Method and Inventory Valuation We value our inventory at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on the first in, first out (FIFO) basis using the retail inventory method (RIM). Under RIM, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail value of the inventories. Inherent in the retail inventory method are certain management estimates that may affect the ending inventory valuation as well as gross margin. The use of RIM will generally result in inventories being valued at the lower of cost or market as markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories. Management estimates the need for an additional markdown reserve based on a review of historical clearance markdowns, current business trends, expected vendor funding and discontinued merchandise categories. We also record a reserve for estimated inventory shrink between the last physical inventory count and the balance sheet date. Shrink is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory. Shrink may occur due to theft, loss, inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods, among other things. We generally perform an annual physical inventory count at each of our stores, distribution centers and E Commerce fulfillment centers. The shrink reserve is based on sales and actual shrink results from previous inventories. We did not make any material changes in the methodologies used to value our inventory or to estimate the markdown and shrink reserves during 2011, 2010 or 2009. We believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for our inventory reserves. Though historical reserves have approximated actual markdowns and shrink adjustments, it is possible that future results could differ from current recorded reserves. Because we routinely record permanent markdowns for potentially obsolete merchandise, we do not believe that a markdown reserve was required as of January 28, 2012. Changes in the assumptions used to estimate our markdown reserve requirement would not have had a material impact on our financial statements. A 10 basis point change in estimated inventory shrink would also have had an immaterial impact on our financial statements. Vendor Allowances We receive allowances from many of our merchandise vendors. These allowances often are reimbursements for markdowns that we have taken in order to sell the merchandise and or to support the gross margins earned in connection with the sales of merchandise. The allowances generally relate to sold inventory or permanent markdowns and, accordingly, are reflected as reductions to cost of merchandise sold. Allowances related to merchandise that has not yet been sold are recorded in inventory. We also receive vendor allowances which represent reimbursements of costs (primarily advertising) that we have incurred to promote the vendors merchandise. These allowances are generally netted against advertising or the other related costs as the costs are incurred. Advertising allowances in excess of costs incurred are recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs. 30 Most of our vendor allowance agreements are supported by signed contracts which are binding, but informal in nature. The terms and conditions of these arrangements vary significantly from vendor to vendor and are influenced by, among other things, the type of merchandise to be supported. Vendor allowances will fluctuate based on the amount of promotional and clearance markdowns necessary to liquidate the inventory as well as advertising and other reimbursed costs. Insurance Reserve Estimates We use a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks. We retain the initial risk of $500,000 per occurrence in workers compensation claims and $250,000 per occurrence in general liability claims. We record reserves for workers compensation and general liability claims which include the total amounts that we expect to pay for a fully developed loss and related expenses, such as fees paid to attorneys, experts and investigators. The fully developed loss includes amounts for both reported claims and incurred, but not reported losses. We use a third party actuary to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks. The actuary considers historical claims experience, demographic and severity factors and actuarial assumptions to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks. As of January 28, 2012, estimated liabilities for workers compensation and general liability claims, excluding administrative expenses and before pre funding, were approximately $80 million. A change in claims frequency and severity of claims from historical experience as well as changes in state statutes and the mix of states in which we operate could result in a change to the required reserve levels. Changes in actuarial assumptions could also have an impact on estimated reserves. Historically, our actuarial estimates have not been materially different from actual results. We are fully self insured for employee related health care benefits, a portion of which is paid by our associates. We use a third party actuary to estimate the liability for incurred, but not reported, health care claims. This estimate uses historical claims information as well as estimated health care trends. As of January 28, 2012, we had recorded approximately $14 million for medical, pharmacy and dental claims which were incurred in 2011 and expected to be paid in 2012. Historically, our actuarial estimates have not been materially different from actual results. Effective January 1, 2012, we are self insured for a portion of our property losses. As there were no significant property losses in January 2012, we had no related reserves as of January 28, 2012. Impairment of Assets As of January 28, 2012, our investment in buildings and improvements, before accumulated depreciation, was $9 billion. We review these buildings and improvements for impairment when an event or changes in circumstances, such as decisions to close a store or significant operating losses, indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. For operating stores, a potential impairment has occurred if projected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the store assets are less than the net carrying amount of the assets. If required, we would record an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. We estimate fair value as the net present value of cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets. When determining the stream of projected future cash flows associated with an individual store, management estimates future store performance including sales growth rates, gross margin and controllable 31 expenses, such as store payroll and occupancy expense. Projected cash flows must be estimated for future periods throughout the remaining life of the property, which may be as many as 40 years in the future. The accuracy of these estimates will be impacted by a number of factors including general economic conditions, changes in competitive landscape and our ability to effectively manage the operations of the store. We have not historically experienced any significant impairment of long lived assets. Additionally, impairment of an individual building and related improvements, net of accumulated depreciation, would not generally be material to our financial results. Income Taxes We regularly evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit for income tax positions we have taken in various federal and state filings by considering all relevant facts, circumstances and information available to us. If we believe it is more likely than not that our position will be sustained, we recognize a benefit at the largest amount which we believe is cumulatively greater than 50% likely to be realized. Our unrecognized tax benefit, excluding accrued interest and penalties, was $101 million as of January 28, 2012 and $96 million as of January 29, 2011. Unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances. Also, as audits are completed or statutes of limitations lapse, it may be necessary to record adjustments to our taxes payable, deferred tax assets, tax reserves or income tax expense. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. Operating Leases As of January 28, 2012, 724 of our 1,127 retail stores were subject to either a ground or building lease. Accounting for leased properties requires compliance with technical accounting rules and significant judgment by management. Application of these accounting rules and assumptions made by management will determine whether we are considered the owner for accounting purposes or whether the lease is accounted for as a capital or operating lease in accordance with ASC 840, Leases. If we are considered the owner for accounting purposes or the lease is considered a capital lease, we record the property and a related financing or capital lease obligation on our balance sheet. The asset is then depreciated over its expected lease term. Rent payments for these properties are recognized as interest expense and a reduction of the financing or capital lease obligation. If the lease is considered an operating lease, it is not recorded on our balance sheet and rent expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the expected lease term. The most significant estimates used by management in accounting for property leases and the impact of these estimates are as follows: Expected lease term Our expected lease term includes both contractual lease periods and cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty. The expected lease term is used in determining whether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or a capital lease. A lease is considered a capital lease if the lease term exceeds 75% of the leased assets useful life. The expected lease term is also used in determining the depreciable life of the asset or the straight line rent recognition period. Increasing the expected lease term will increase the probability that a lease will be considered a capital lease and will generally result in higher rent expense for an operating lease and higher interest and depreciation expenses for a leased property recorded on our balance sheet. 32 Incremental borrowing rate We estimate our incremental borrowing rate using treasury rates for debt with maturities comparable to the expected lease term and our credit spread. The incremental borrowing rate is primarily used in determining whether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or a capital lease. A lease is considered a capital lease if the net present value of the lease payments is greater than 90% of the fair market value of the property. Increasing the incremental borrowing rate decreases the net present value of the lease payments and reduces the probability that a lease will be considered a capital lease. For leases which are recorded on our balance sheet with a related capital lease or financing obligation, the incremental borrowing rate is also used in allocating our rental payments between interest expense and a reduction of the outstanding obligation. Fair market value of leased asset The fair market value of leased retail property is generally estimated based on comparable market data or consideration received from the landlord. Fair market value is used in determining whether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or a capital lease. A lease is considered a capital lease if the net present value of the lease payments is greater than 90% of the fair market value of the property. Increasing the fair market value reduces the probability that a lease will be considered a capital lease. Fair market value is also used in determining the amount of property and related financing obligation to be recognized on our balance sheet for certain leased properties which are considered owned for accounting purposes. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk All of our long term debt at year end 2011 is at fixed interest rates and, therefore, is not affected by changes in interest rates. When our long term debt instruments mature, we may refinance them at then existing market interest rates, which may be more or less than interest rates on the maturing debt. Cash equivalents and long term investments earn interest at variable rates and are affected by changes in interest rates. During 2011, average investments were $1.6 billion and average yield was 0.3%. If interest rates on the average 2011 variable rate cash equivalents and long term investments increased by 100 basis points, our annual interest income would also increase by approximately $16 million assuming comparable investment levels. We share in the net risk adjusted revenue of the Kohls credit card portfolio as defined by the sum of finance charges, late fees and other revenue less write offs of uncollectible accounts. We also share the costs of funding the outstanding receivables if interest rates were to exceed defined rates. As a result, our share of profits from the credit card portfolio may be negatively impacted by increases in interest rates. The reduced profitability, if any, will be impacted by various factors, including our ability to pass higher funding costs on to the credit card holders and the outstanding receivable balance, and can not be reasonably estimated at this time.
