Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. OVERVIEW Loews Corporation reported a loss for the year ended 2001 of $589.1 million or $3.02 per share, compared to net income of $1,876.7 million or $9.44 per share in 2000. The net loss was primarily attributable to CNAs second quarter reserve charge of $1.8 billion and losses of $264.6 million at CNA related to the World Trade Center attack and related events, as well as the fourth quarter restructuring and other charges at CNA, and a charge of $121.0 million after taxes at Lorillard in the second quarter related to the agreement with the Engle class. The net loss in 2001 includes net investment gains of $792.2 million or $4.06 per share compared to gains of $577.1 million or $2.90 per share in the prior year. The net loss also includes a charge for an accounting change of $53.3 million or $.27 per share, related to the adoption by CNA of a new accounting standard for derivative instruments. Net operating income (loss) is calculated by deducting net investment gains or losses (investment gains or losses after deduction of related income taxes and minority interests) and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax and minority interest, from net income (loss). Analysts following our stock have advised us that such information is meaningful in assisting them in measuring the performance of our insurance subsidiaries. In addition, it is used in managements discussion of the results of operations for the insurance related segments due to the significance of the amount of net investment gains or losses. Net operating income (loss) is also a common measure throughout the insurance industry. Net realized investment gains are excluded from this operating measure because investment gains or losses related to CNAs available for sale investment portfolio are largely discretionary, are generally driven by economic factors that are not necessarily consistent with key drivers of underwriting performance, and are therefore not an indication of trends in operations. Net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2001 was $188.1 million or $.98 per share, compared to $502.9 million or $2.55 per share in 2000. Net investment gains amounted to $236.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2001, compared to gains of $172.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2000. Net operating loss, which excludes net investment gains and losses, for the fourth quarter was $48.6 million or $.26 per share, compared to net operating income of $330.3 million or $1.67 per share in 2000. The lower results in the current quarter are primarily due to charges of $110.8, $46.1 and $61.2 million, after taxes and minority interest, at CNA related to restructuring and other related charges, Enron related losses, and reserve strengthening primarily for the current accident year, respectively. Revenues for the year ended 2001 were $19.4 billion, compared to $21.3 billion in 2000. Revenues for the year ended 2001 declined due primarily to lower earned premiums for CNAs Property Casualty business. At year end 2001, Loews Corporation had a book value of $50.39 per share compared to $56.74 per share in 2000. Issuance Of Carolina Group Tracking Stock On January 4, 2002 the shareholders of Loews Corporation authorized and approved the creation of a new class of common stock of the Company, called Carolina Group stock and on February 6, 2002 in an initial public offering the Company issued 40.3 million shares of Carolina Group stock. The Carolina Group stock, commonly called a tracking stock, is intended to reflect the economic performance of a defined group of assets and liabilities of the Company referred to as the Carolina Group. The Company has attributed the following assets and liabilities to the Carolina Group: (a) The Companys 100% stock ownership interest in Lorillard, Inc.; (b) $2.5 billion of notional, intergroup debt owed by the Carolina Group to the Loews Group, bearing interest at the annual rate of 8.0% and, subject to optional prepayment, due December 31, 2021; (c) any and all liabilities, costs and expenses of the Company and Lorillard, Inc. and the subsidiaries and predecessors of Lorillard, Inc., arising out of or related to tobacco or otherwise arising out of the past, present or future business of Lorillard, Inc. or its subsidiaries or predecessors, or claims arising out of or related to the sale of any businesses previously sold by Lorillard, Inc. or its subsidiaries or predecessors, in each case, whether grounded in tort, contract, statute or otherwise, whether pending or asserted in the future; (d) all net income or net losses arising from the assets and liabilities that are reflected in the Carolina Group and all net proceeds from any disposition of those assets, in each case, after deductions to reflect dividends paid to holders of Carolina Group stock or credited to the Loews Group in respect of its intergroup interest; and (e) any acquisitions or investments made from assets reflected in the Carolina Group. Holders of Carolina Group stock have an approximately 23.17% economic interest in the Carolina Group. The Loews Group consists of all of the Companys assets and liabilities other than the 23.17% economic interest in the Carolina Group represented by the outstanding Carolina Group stock, and includes as an asset the notional intergroup debt of the Carolina Group referred to above. The creation of the Carolina Group and the issuance of Carolina Group stock does not change the Companys ownership of Lorillard, Inc. or Lorillard, Inc.s status as a separate legal entity. The Carolina Group and the Loews Group are notional groups that are intended to reflect the performance of the defined sets of assets and liabilities 39 of each such group as described above. The Carolina Group and the Loews Group are not separate legal entities and the attribution of assets and liabilities to the Loews Group or the Carolina Group does not affect title to the assets or responsibility for the liabilities. Holders of the Companys common stock and of Carolina Group stock are shareholders of Loews Corporation and are subject to the risks related to an equity investment in Loews Corporation. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT CNA Insurance operations are conducted by subsidiaries of CNA Financial Corporation ("CNA"). CNA is an 89% owned subsidiary of the Company. CNA underwent significant management changes, strategic realignment and restructuring in the second half of 2001. These management changes as well as the strategic realignment and restructuring have changed the way CNA manages its operations and makes business decisions; and therefore, necessitated a change in CNAs reportable segments. The changes made to CNAs reportable segments were as follows: (i) Commercial Insurance and CNA Excess & Select (formerly included in Agency Market Operations) and Risk Management Operations, were combined into Standard Lines; (ii) CNA Pro, CNA HealthPro, CNA Guaranty and Credit (formerly included in Specialty Operations) and Global Operations were combined into Specialty Lines; (iii) losses and expenses related to the centralized adjusting and settlement of environmental pollution and other mass tort and asbestos ("APMT") claims previously included in Commercial Insurance, CNA Excess & Select, Risk Management and Global Operations are now included in the Other Insurance segment; and (iv) Personal Insurance, CNA UniSource, agriculture insurance, entertainment insurance and other financial lines were moved from the various property casualty segments to the Other Insurance segment. CNA Re, Group Operations and Life Operations are unchanged from the prior segment presentation. CNA now conducts its operations through five operating groups: Standard Lines, Specialty Lines and CNA Re (these groups comprise the Companys Property Casualty segment); Group Operations and Life Operations. In addition to these five operating segments, certain other activities are reported in the Other Insurance segment. These segments reflect the way CNA manages its operations and makes business decisions. Segment disclosures of prior periods have been modified to conform with the current year presentation. World Trade Center Event During the third quarter of 2001, CNA experienced a severe catastrophe loss estimated at $468.0 million pretax, net of reinsurance, related to the September 11, 2001 World Trade Center disaster and related events ("WTC event"). The loss estimate is based on a total industry loss of $50.0 billion and includes all lines of insurance. The current estimate takes into account CNAs substantial reinsurance agreements, including its catastrophe reinsurance program and corporate reinsurance programs. These loss estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty. Subsequent developments on claims arising out of the WTC event, as well as the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables, could result in an increase in the total estimated net loss, which could be material to CNAs results of operations. The following table provides managements estimate of losses related to the WTC event on a gross basis (before reinsurance) and a net basis (after reinsurance) on CNAs operating segments: Net of Tax Pretax Aggregate Total and Gross Net Reinsurance Pretax Minority Year Ended December 31, 2001 Losses Impact (a) Benefit Impact Interest (In millions) Standard Lines $ 375.0 $ 185.0 $108.0 $ 77.0 $ 44.0 Specialty Lines 214.0 30.0 12.0 18.0 11.0 CNA Re 662.0 410.0 139.0 271.0 154.0 Total Property and Casualty 1,251.0 625.0 259.0 366.0 209.0 Group Operations 322.0 80.0 80.0 46.0 Life Operations 75.0 22.0 22.0 12.0 Total $1,648.0 $ 727.0 $259.0 $468.0 $267.0 (a) Pretax impact of the WTC event before the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties. The net impact includes $85.0 of reinstatement and additional premiums. 40 Second Quarter 2001 Prior Year Reserve Strengthening During the second quarter of 2001, CNA noted the continued emergence of adverse loss experience across several lines of business related to prior years that are discussed in further detail below. CNA completed a number of reserve studies during the second quarter of 2001 for many of its lines of business, including those in which these adverse trends were noted. With respect to APMT reserves, CNA reviewed internal claims data as well as studies generated by external parties, including a significant industry analysis of asbestos and environmental pollution exposures by an international rating agency. As a result of these various reviews, management concluded that ultimate losses, including losses for APMT claims, would be higher in the range of possible outcomes than previously estimated. CNA recorded charges of $2.6 billion ($1.5 billion after tax and minority interest), net of the related corporate aggregate reinsurance treaty benefit, to strengthen reserves associated with a change in estimate of prior year net loss reserves, including $1.2 billion pretax ($.7 billion after tax and minority interest) related to APMT. The second quarter 2001 reserve strengthening and related items comprising the amounts noted above are detailed by segment in the following table: Standard Specialty Other Year Ended December 31, 2001 Lines Lines CNA Re Insurance Total (In millions) Net reserve strengthening excluding the impact of the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaty: APMT $ 57.0 $ 1,140.0 $1,197.0 Non APMT $ 523.0 $407.0 574.0 90.0 1,594.0 Total 523.0 407.0 631.0 1,230.0 2,791.0 Pretax benefit from corporate aggregate reinsurance treaty on accident year 1999 (197.0) (26.0) (223.0)* Accrual for insurance related assessments 48.0 48.0 Net reserve strengthening and related accruals 374.0 407.0 605.0 1,230.0 2,616.0 Change in estimate of premium accruals 629.0 3.0 (13.0) (3.0) 616.0 Reduction of related commission accruals (50.0) (50.0) Net premium and related accrual reductions 579.0 3.0 (13.0) (3.0) 566.0 Total pretax second quarter 2001 reserve strengthening and other related accruals $ 953.0 $410.0 $ 592.0 $ 1,227.0 $3,182.0 Total after tax and minority interest second quarter 2001 reserve strengthening and other related accruals $ 539.0 $241.0 $ 334.0 $ 695.0 $1,809.0 * $500.0 of ceded losses reduced by $230.0 of ceded premiums and $47.0 of interest charges. The non APMT adverse loss development was the result of recent analyses of several lines of business. This development related principally to commercial insurance coverages including automobile liability and multiple peril, as well as assumed reinsurance and health care related coverages. A brief summary of these lines of business and the associated reserve development is discussed below and in more detail in the discussion of CNAs segments. Approximately $600.0 million of the adverse loss development, excluding the impact of the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaty, is a result of analyses of several coverages provided to commercial entities written by various segments of CNA. These analyses showed unexpected increases in the size of claims for several lines, including commercial automobile liability, general liability and the liability portion of commercial multiple peril. In addition, the number of commercial automobile liability claims was higher than expected. Finally, several state specific factors resulted in higher than anticipated losses, including developments associated with commercial automobile liability coverage in Ohio and general liability coverage provided to contractors in New York. An analysis of CNA Res assumed reinsurance business showed that the paid and reported losses for recent accident years were higher than expectations and resulted in an increase of net reserves of approximately $560.0 million, excluding the impact of the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaty. The estimated ultimate loss ratios for these recent accident years have been revised to reflect the paid and reported losses. Approximately $320.0 million of adverse loss development, excluding the impact of the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaty, occurred in 41 Specialty Lines and was caused by coverages provided to health care related entities. The level of paid and reported losses associated with coverages provided to national long term care facilities was higher than expected. In addition, the average size of claims resulting from coverages provided to physicians and institutions providing health care related services increased more than expected. Concurrent with CNAs review of loss reserves, CNA completed comprehensive studies of estimated premium receivable accruals on retrospectively rated insurance policies and involuntary market facilities. As a result, CNA recorded a $.6 billion pretax ($.3 billion after tax and minority interest) charge related to retrospective premium and other premium accruals ("premium accruals"). The studies included the review of all such retrospectively rated insurance policies and the current estimate of ultimate losses. As a result of this review and changes in premiums associated with the change in estimates for loss reserves, CNA recorded a pretax reduction in premium accruals of $566.0 million. The effect on net earned premiums was $616.0 million offset by a reduction of accrued commissions of $50.0 million. Approximately $188.0 million of this amount resulted from a change in estimate in premiums related to involuntary market facilities, which had an offsetting impact on net losses and therefore had no impact on the net operating results for the year. Accruals for ceded premiums related to other reinsurance treaties increased $83.0 million due to the reserve strengthening. The remainder of the decrease in premium accruals relates to the change in estimate of the amount of retrospective premium receivables as discussed above. Aggregate Reinsurance Treaties In 1999, CNA entered into an aggregate reinsurance treaty related to the 1999 through 2001 accident years covering substantially all of CNAs property casualty lines of business (the "Aggregate Cover"). CNA has two sections of coverage under the terms of the Aggregate Cover. These coverages attach at defined loss and allocated loss adjustment expense (collectively, "losses") ratios for each accident year. Coverage under the first section of the Aggregate Cover, which is available for all accident years covered by the contract, has annual limits of $500.0 million of ceded losses with an aggregate limit of $1.0 billion of ceded losses for the three year period. The ceded premiums are a percentage of ceded losses and for each $500.0 million of limit the premium is $230.0 million. The second section of the Aggregate Cover, which is only available for accident year 2001, provides additional coverage of up to $510.0 million of ceded losses for a maximum ceded premium of $310.0 million. Under the Aggregate Cover, interest charges on the funds withheld accrue at 8.0% per annum. If the aggregate loss ratio for the three year period exceeds certain thresholds, additional premiums may be payable and the rate at which interest charges are accrued would increase to 8.3% per annum. The coverage under the second section of the Aggregate Cover was triggered for the 2001 accident year. As a result of losses related to the WTC event, the limit under this section was exhausted. Additionally, as a result of the significant reserve additions recorded during 2001, the $500.0 million limit on the 1999 accident year under the first section was also fully utilized. No losses have been ceded to the remaining $500.0 million of limit on accident years 2000 and 2001 under the first section. In 2001, CNA entered into a one year aggregate reinsurance treaty related to the 2001 accident year covering substantially all property casualty lines of business in the Continental Casualty Company pool (the "CCC Cover"). The loss protection provided by the CCC Cover has an aggregate limit of approximately $760.0 million of ceded losses. The CCC Cover provides continuous coverage in excess of the second section of the Aggregate Cover discussed above. Under the CCC Cover, interest charges on the funds withheld generally accrue at 8.0% per annum. The interest rate increases to 10.0% per annum if the aggregate loss ratio exceeds certain thresholds. The impact of the Aggregate and CCC Cover on pretax operating results for the year ended December 31, 2001, was as follows: Aggregate CCC Cover Cover Total (In millions) Ceded earned premiums $ (543.0) $(260.0) $ (803.0) Ceded losses 1,010.0 470.0 1,480.0 Interest charges (81.0) (20.0) (101.0) Pretax benefit on operating results $ 386.0 $ 190.0 $ 576.0 42 The pretax benefit from the Aggregate Cover and CCC Cover by operating segment on estimated losses related to the second quarter 2001 reserve strengthening, the WTC event and Core operations for the year ended December 31, 2001, was as follows: Second Quarter 2001 Reserve WTC Core Strengthening Event Operations Total (Amounts in millions) Standard Lines $197.0 $108.0 $76.0 $381.0 Specialty Lines 12.0 21.0 33.0 CNA Re 26.0 139.0 (3.0) 162.0 Pretax benefit on operating results $223.0 $259.0 $94.0 $576.0 2001 Restructuring In 2001, CNA finalized and approved two separate restructuring plans. The first plan, which related to CNAs Information Technology operations (the "IT Plan"), was approved in June of 2001. The second plan, which principally relates to restructuring the Property Casualty segments and Life Operations, discontinuation of variable life and annuity business and consolidation of real estate locations (the "2001 Plan"), was approved in December of 2001. IT Plan The overall goal of the IT Plan was to improve technology for the underwriting function throughout CNA and to eliminate inefficiencies in the deployment of IT resources. The changes facilitate a strong focus on enterprise wide system initiatives. The IT Plan had two main components, which include the reorganization of IT resources into the Technology and Operations Group with a structure based on centralized, functional roles and the implementation of an integrated technology roadmap that includes common architecture and platform standards that directly support CNAs strategies. As summarized in the following table, CNA incurred $62.0 million, pretax, of restructuring and other related charges in 2001 for the IT Plan. CNA does not expect to incur significant amounts of additional charges with respect to the IT Plan in any future period and, as a result, does not intend to separately classify such expenses as restructuring and other related charges when they occur. IT Plan charges by segment for the year ended December 31, 2001, are as follows: Employee Termination Impaired and Related Asset Other Benefit Costs Charges Costs Total (In millions) Standard Lines $ 5.0 $ 1.0 $ 6.0 Specialty Lines 2.0 2.0 Total Property Casualty 7.0 1.0 8.0 Life Operations 17.0 17.0 Other Insurance 22.0 14.0 $1.0 37.0 Total $29.0 $32.0 $1.0 $62.0 43 In connection with the IT Plan after the write off of impaired assets, CNA accrued $30.0 million of restructuring and other related charges in 2001 (the "IT Plan Initial Accrual"). These charges primarily related to $29.0 million of workforce reductions of approximately 260 positions gross and 249 positions net and $1.0 million of other costs. The following table summarizes the IT Plan Initial Accrual and the activity in that accrual during 2001. Approximately $8.0 million of the remaining accrual is expected to be paid out during 2002. Employee Termination Impaired and Related Asset Other Benefit Costs Charges Costs Total (In millions) Initial accrual $29.0 $ 32.0 $1.0 $ 62.0 Cost that did not require cash (32.0) (32.0) Payments charged against liability (19.0) (19.0) Accrued costs $10.0 $1.0 $11.0 Through December 31, 2001, approximately 249 employees were released due to the IT Plan, nearly all of whom were technology support staff. The IT Plan is not expected to result in decreased operating expense in the foreseeable future. This is because savings from the workforce reduction will be offset by new technology related initiatives. 2001 Plan The overall goal of the 2001 Plan is to create a simplified and leaner organization for customers and business partners. The major components of the plan include a reduction in the number of strategic business units ("SBUs") in the property casualty operations, changes in the strategic focus of the Life Operations and consolidation of real estate locations. The reduction in the number of property casualty SBUs resulted in consolidation of SBU functions, including underwriting, claims, marketing and finance. The strategic changes in Life Operations include a decision to discontinue the variable life and annuity business. As summarized in the following table, CNA incurred $189.0 million, pretax, of restructuring and other related charges for the 2001 Plan. CNA does not expect to incur significant amounts of additional charges with respect to the 2001 Plan in any future period and, as a result, does not intend to separately classify such expenses as restructuring and other related charges when they occur. 2001 Plan charges by segment for the year ended December 31, 2001, are as follows: Employee Termination Lease Impaired and Related Termination Asset Other Benefit Costs Costs Charges Costs Total (In millions) Standard Lines $40.0 $ 40.0 Specialty Lines 7.0 $ 4.0 7.0 CNA Re 2.0 6.0 Total Property Casualty 49.0 4.0 53.0 Group Operations 1.0 1.0 Life Operations 9.0 $ 9.0 $35.0 53.0 Other Insurance 9.0 52.0 21.0 82.0 Total $68.0 $56.0 $30.0 $35.0 $189.0 44 All lease termination costs and impaired asset charges, except lease termination costs incurred by operations in the United Kingdom and software write offs incurred by Life Operations, were charged to the Other Insurance segment because office closure and consolidation decisions were not within the control of the other segments affected. Lease termination costs incurred in the United Kingdom relate solely to the operations of CNA Re. All other charges were recorded in the segment benefiting from the services or existence of the employee or asset. The 2001 Plan charges incurred by Standard Lines were $40.0 million, related entirely to employee termination and related benefit costs for planned reductions in the workforce of 1,063 positions, gross and net, of which $27.0 million related to severance and outplacement costs and $13.0 million related to other salary costs. Through December 31, 2001, approximately 510 employees were released due to the 2001 Plan. Approximately 272 of these employees were administrative, technology or financial support staff; approximately 164 of these employees were underwriters, claim adjusters and related insurance services staff; and approximately 74 of these employees were in various other positions. The 2001 Plan charges incurred by Specialty Lines were $7.0 million, related entirely to employee termination and related benefit costs for planned reductions in the workforce of 177 positions, gross and net, of which $5.0 million related to severance and outplacement costs and $2.0 million related to other salary costs. Through December 31, 2001, approximately 107 employees were released due to the 2001 Plan. Approximately 47 of these employees were administrative, technology or financial support staff; approximately 45 of these employees were underwriters, claim adjusters, and related insurance services staff; and approximately 15 of these employees were in various positions. The 2001 Plan charges incurred by CNA Re were $6.0 million. Costs related to employee termination and related benefit costs for planned reductions in the workforce of 33 positions, gross and net, amounted to $2.0 million, all of which related to severance and outplacement costs. Through December 31, 2001 no employees in CNA Re were released due to the 2001 Plan. The remaining $4.0 million of charges incurred by CNA Re related to lease termination costs. The 2001 Plan charges incurred by Group Operations were $1.0 million, related entirely to employee termination and related benefit costs for planned reductions in the workforce of 38 positions, gross and net. Through December 31, 2001 no employees in Group Operations were released due to the 2001 Plan. The 2001 Plan charges incurred by Life Operations were $53.0 million. Costs related to employee termination and related benefit costs for planned reductions in the workforce of 356 positions, gross and net, amounted to $9.0 million, of which $8.0 million related to severance and outplacement costs and $1.0 million related to other salary costs. Through December 31, 2001, approximately seven positions were released due to the 2001 Plan which were primarily administrative, technology and financial support staff positions. Life Operations incurred $9.0 million of impaired asset charges related to software. Other costs of $35.0 million in Life Operations relate to a write off of deferred acquisition costs on in force variable life and annuity contracts as CNA believes that the decision to discontinue these products will negatively impact the persistency of the business. The 2001 Plan charges incurred by the Other Insurance segment were $82.0 million. Costs related to employee termination and related benefit costs for planned reductions in the workforce of 194 positions, gross and net, amounted to $9.0 million, of which $6.0 million related to severance and outplacement costs and $3.0 million related to other salary costs. Through December 31, 2001, 129 employees were released due to the 2001 Plan. Approximately 114 of these employees were administrative, technology or financial support staff; and approximately 15 of these employees were in various other positions. The Other Insurance segment also incurred $73.0 million of lease termination and asset impairment charges related to office closure and consolidation decisions not within the control of the other segments affected. In connection with the 2001 Plan, CNA accrued $189.0 million of these restructuring and other related charges (the "2001 Plan Initial Accrual"). These charges include employee termination and related benefit costs, lease termination costs, impaired asset charges and other costs. The following table summarizes the 2001 Plan Initial Accrual and the activity in that accrual during 2001. Approximately $94.0 million of the remaining accrual is expected to be paid out during 2002. 45 Employee Termination Lease Impaired and Related Termination Asset Other Benefit Costs Costs Charges Costs Total (In millions) Initial accrual $68.0 $ 56.0 $ 30.0 $ 35.0 $ 189.0 Cost that did not require cash (35.0) (35.0) Payments charged against liability (2.0) (2.0) Accrued costs $66.0 $56.0 $ 30.0 $ 152.0 The majority of the positions impacted by the restructuring that were not released by December 31, 2001 are expected to be released in the first quarter of 2002. The real estate consolidation will occur throughout 2002, however the full level of savings from the consolidation will not be realized until the fourth quarter. Management anticipates that the restructuring activities in 2001 will result in cost savings of approximately $100.0 million in 2002. Additionally, at December 31, 2000, an accrual of $7.0 million for lease termination costs remained related to the August 1998 restructuring ("1998 Plan"). Approximately $6.0 million of these costs were paid in 2001, resulting in a remaining accrual of $1.0 million at December 31, 2001. No restructuring and other related charges related to the 1998 Plan were incurred during 2001 or 2000. Restructuring and other related charges for the 1998 Plan amounted to $83.0 million in 1999. Terrorism Exposure CNA and the insurance industry incurred substantial losses related to the tragic events of September 11, 2001. For the most part, CNA believes the industry was able to absorb the loss of capital from these losses, but the capacity to withstand the effect of any additional terrorism events was significantly diminished. The public debate following September 11 centered on the role, if any, the U.S. federal government should play in providing a "terrorism backstop" for the industry. Several legislative proposals were introduced, but as yet, Congress has not enacted any of the proposed solutions. Without any federal backstop in place, CNAs businesses are exposed to losses arising from terrorism events. CNA is attempting to mitigate this exposure through its underwriting practices, policy terms and conditions, and use of reinsurance. While the unexpired portion of CNAs current reinsurance program generally provides coverage for terrorism events, CNA expects that future property casualty and certain group life and accident reinsurance renewals will either exclude coverage or be significantly limited with respect to terrorism events. CNA does not expect any terrorism exclusion to be included in future individual life reinsurance renewals. CNA is generally including a terrorism exclusion or sub limit in its primary and reinsurance assumed policy forms and contracts for large property risks in selected geographic areas. General liability and commercial auto policies for large commercial customers also generally exclude terrorism where permissible by law. The primary property and casualty policy forms applicable to new and renewal policies for small and middle market commercial customers will generally include a terrorism exclusion; however, these policy forms have not yet been approved in all states. CNA is generally prohibited, from excluding terrorism exposure from its primary workers compensation, individual life and group life and health policies. 2002 Reinsurance Considerations In addition to the terrorism coverage issues discussed, CNA expects other significant changes related to the reinsurance environment in 2002. Due to the significant increase in reinsurance costs for several lines of insurance, CNA expects to purchase less reinsurance protection in 2002 than in 2001. The amount of reinsurance purchased has a direct impact on the level of gross and net exposure that CNA is willing to underwrite in certain lines. For example, the net retention on a substantial portion of Standard Lines workers compensation exposure will generally increase from $500,000 per each loss occurrence in 2001 to $10.0 million per each loss occurrence in 2002. CNA expects to retain approximately $60.0 million more premium in 2002 as a result of this increase in retention in workers compensation exposure. Other property casualty exposures expected to be significantly impacted by changes in the level, cost and availability of reinsurance purchased in 2002 include, but are not limited to, surety, workers compensation, catastrophe and professional liability. CNA has purchased less finite reinsurance in 2002 than in prior years. The reduced level of reinsurance purchased in 2002 will likely increase the volatility of reported losses; however, CNA will also retain more premium than in prior years. CNA is currently finalizing its aggregate reinsurance protection for 2002 for a substantial portion of its property casualty business. The reinsurance protection will be handled on a funds withheld basis. 46 Property Casualty CNA conducts its property casualty operations through the following operating segments: Standard Lines, Specialty Lines, and CNA Re. The following table summarizes key components of the Property Casualty segment operating results for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999. Year Ended December 31 2001 2000 1999 (In millions) Net earned premiums $ 5,010.0 $6,927.0 $ 7,359.0 Underwriting loss (3,122.0) (672.0) (1,147.0) Net operating (loss) income (1,249.1) 412.6 111.3 Ratios: Loss and loss adjustment expense ratio 114.6% 77.0% 83.0% Expense ratio 45.4 31.5 32.2 Dividend ratio 2.3 1.2 .4 Combined ratio 162.3% 109.7% 115.6% 2001 adjusted ratios* Loss and loss adjustment expense ratio 77.8% Expense ratio 35.3 Dividend ratio 1.8 Combined ratio 114.9% Adjusted underwriting loss* $ (946.0) *The adjusted results exclude the impact of the second quarter 2001 reserve strengthening, the WTC event, corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties and restructuring and other related charges. 2001 Compared with 2000 The net operating loss for the Property Casualty segment was $1,249.1 million in 2001 as compared with net operating income of $412.6 million in 2000. The decline in net operating results was principally due to prior year reserve strengthening of $1,113.7 million recorded in the second quarter of 2001 related to a change in estimate of prior year net loss reserves and retrospective premium accruals, net of the related corporate aggregate reinsurance treaty benefit; estimated losses related to the WTC event of $209.0 million, net of the related corporate aggregate reinsurance treaty benefit, and restructuring and other related charges of $36.8 million recorded in 2001. In addition, net operating results for 2001 decreased $97.1 million due to a decline in investment income from limited partnerships and $61.2 million for reserve strengthening primarily for the current accident year, in the London based primary commercial and marine operations. Net operating income also decreased $46.1 million related to the recent bankruptcy filing by certain Enron entities recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001. These declines were partially offset by lower prior year adverse loss reserve development (excluding the second quarter 2001 reserve development) and a $52.5 million benefit related to corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties for core operations. Net operating results in 2000 benefited from a change in estimate for certain insurance related assessments of $52.0 million in 2000. Net operating results also decreased due to a $141.8 million after tax charge to strengthen prior underwriting year loss reserves for CNA Reinsurance Company Limited ("CNA Re U.K."). There was no tax benefit related to this charge due to the inability to recover further tax benefits related to the underwriting losses of CNA Re U.K. During the fourth quarter, CNA updated its impairment analysis of subsidiaries held for sale, including the United Kingdom subsidiaries of CNA Re. The updated impairment analysis indicated that the $248.0 million after tax and minority interest realized loss recorded in the second quarter of 2001 should be reduced by $141.8 million, primarily because the net assets of CNA Re U.K. had been significantly diminished by its operating losses in the second half of 2001. In addition, CNA updated its estimate of disposal costs, including anticipated capital contributions, to reflect changes in the planned structure of the anticipated sale. The sale of the United Kingdom insurance subsidiaries will be subject to regulatory approval and all sales are expected to be completed in 2002. Based upon the significance of the charges related to the second quarter 2001 reserve strengthening, WTC event, corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties, and restructuring and other related charges, these items are discussed in the aggregate in the preceding sections. The following discussion compares underwriting results and ratios excluding the effect of these items. The adjusted combined ratio increased 5.2 points in 2001 as compared with 2000 and the adjusted underwriting results for the Property Casualty segment declined $274.0 million. The adjusted loss ratio increased 0.8 points as a result of the reduced net earned premiums base, losses related to Enron, favorable loss development recorded in 2000 for the architects and engineers business not present in 2001, declined underwriting results in global and marine lines related to current accident year reserve strengthening as discussed above, and the prior underwriting year reserve strengthening of CNA Re U.K. These declines were partially offset by improved underwriting results across most standard lines, 47 particularly the automobile and packages lines, due to earned rate achievement and re underwriting efforts undertaken last year, and lower prior year adverse loss development (excluding the second quarter 2001 reserve strengthening). The increase in the adjusted expense ratio of 3.8 points was primarily attributable to the decrease in the net earned premium base, the write off of unrecoverable deferred acquisition costs in the vehicle warranty line of business, an increase in the accrual for guaranty fund assessments related to the Reliance insolvency, and the decreased impact of the change in estimate for certain insurance related assessments. The adjusted dividend ratio increased 0.6 points primarily due to adverse development in dividend reserves in Standard Lines in 2001 compared with favorable development taken in 2000. Net earned premiums for the Property Casualty segment decreased $1,917.0 million for 2001 compared with 2000. This decline was comprised of decreases in Standard Lines of $1,516.0 million and CNA Re of $448.0 million, partially offset by increased net earned premiums for Specialty Lines of $47.0 million. Net earned premiums for Standard Lines decreased primarily as a result of $564.0 million of ceded premiums related to the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties, additional ceded premiums other than the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties, increased adverse premium development excluding the second quarter 2001 reserve strengthening, a change in estimate for involuntary market premium accruals and additional adverse experience in retrospective premium accruals. The change in estimate related to retrospective premium receivables was based upon CNAs completion of comprehensive studies related to estimated premium receivable accruals on retrospectively rated insurance policies and involuntary market facilities. The studies included the review of all such retrospectively rated insurance policies and the current estimate of ultimate losses. Net earned premiums for CNA Re decreased as a result of $161.0 million of ceded premiums related to the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties. In addition, premiums decreased as a result of the announced intention to sell the United Kingdom insurance subsidiaries. These declines were partially offset by reinstatement and additional premiums of $89.0 million related to the WTC event. Net earned premiums for Specialty Lines increased due to increases in the law firms, the long term care and architects and engineers products as well as increased rate achievement in Europe, primarily in property lines, the reserve for retrospective premium increase recorded in 2000 and decreased ceded premiums related to reinsurance for the medical professional liability line of business. Partially offsetting these improvements was $77.0 million in additional ceded premiums related to the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties, declines in the warranty line of business and adverse experience in retrospective premium accruals recorded in the second quarter of 2001 reserve strengthening. 2000 Compared with 1999 Net operating income improved $301.3 million for 2000 as compared with 1999. The net operating income improvements were primarily driven by improved underwriting results partially offset by decreased investment income. In addition, net operating income in both 2000 and 1999 benefited from a change in estimate for certain insurance related assessments resulting from regulatory changes in the basis on which certain of these assessments are calculated. The after tax impact of this change was $52.0 million in 2000 and $43.7 million in 1999. Underwriting results improved $475.0 million for 2000 as compared with 1999. The combined ratio decreased 5.9 points for the Property Casualty segment for 2000 as compared with 1999. This decrease reflects an improvement in the loss ratio of 6.0 points which is primarily attributable to significant rate increases across the entire book of business, favorable catastrophe experience, reduced prior year reserve strengthening and the increased use of reinsurance. Catastrophe losses for 2000 improved by $195.0 million for the Property Casualty segment. In addition to the decrease in the loss ratio, there was a decrease of 0.7 points in the expense ratio to 31.5% due principally to the absence of restructuring related charges that occurred in 1999 but did not recur in 2000. The dividend ratio increased 0.8 points relating to reduced favorable development in dividend reserves for Standard Lines in 2000 as compared to 1999. Net earned premiums for the Property Casualty segment decreased $432.0 million in 2000 as compared with 1999. This decline in net earned premiums was comprised of decreases in Standard Lines of $271.0 million, Specialty Lines of $74.0 million and CNA Re of $87.0 million. The decrease in net earned premiums in Standard Lines was primarily attributable to continued efforts to re underwrite business and obtain adequate rates for exposure underwritten and increased use of reinsurance. The net earned premiums decline for Specialty Lines was related principally to (i) active decisions to renew only those accounts which meet current underwriting guidelines supporting the ongoing commitment to underwriting discipline, (ii) an increase in the retrospective return premium relating to favorable loss experience in the retrospectively rated architects and engineers business, and (iii) a $30.0 million decline due to the increased use of reinsurance for the medical professional liability lines of CNA HealthPro. These declines were partially offset by growth in the commercial casualty and property lines in the European operations, as well as growth in the commercial warranty and surety lines. CNA Re experienced a decrease in net earned premiums that reflects decisions not to renew contracts that management believed did not meet profitability targets, partially offset by modest rate increases. 48 Group Group Operations provides group life and health insurance products and services to employers, affinity groups and other entities that purchase insurance as a group. Group Operations also provides health insurance to federal employees, as well as life and health reinsurance. 2001 Compared with 2000 Net operating income decreased by $32.0 million in 2001 as compared with 2000. This decrease is related primarily to estimated losses of $45.3 million after tax and minority interest as a result of the WTC event. Net operating income also declined $20.1 million as a result of the sale of Life Reinsurance and $11.4 million due to a decline in limited partnership income. Life Reinsurance contributed net operating income of $19.0 million in 2000. Partially offsetting these declines were improvements as a result of exiting unprofitable lines of approximately $35.0 million, and increased income in other product lines, primarily the disability and group long term care lines of $10.0 million. Net earned premiums for Group Operations decreased $217.0 million in 2001 as compared with 2000. Net earned premiums declined $228.0 million as a result of the sale of Life Reinsurance and $163.0 million in Group Reinsurance primarily as a result of terminating unprofitable contracts with independent underwriting agencies in 2000. These declines were partially offset by increases in Federal Markets of $116.0 million due to increased medical cost trends and growth in Group Benefits of $58.0 million, particularly in the disability and group long term care lines of business. Group Operations achieved rate increases in 2001 that averaged approximately 4.0% for the disability line of business. Premium persistency rates were in the mid 80 percent range. For the group life line of business, rate increases averaged 1.0% to 2.0%. Premium persistency rates were in the lower 80% range. 2000 Compared with 1999 Net operating income increased $44.5 million in 2000 as compared with 1999. This increase relates to a $20.9 million improvement in Federal Markets due to the 1999 exit of unprofitable medical lines, a $29.5 million improvement in Group Reinsurance, a $3.5 million improvement in Life Reinsurance and a $6.1 million increase in limited partnership income. These improvements were partially offset by a $15.7 million decline in Group Benefits due to favorable 1999 loss experience in the group life line of business. The improvement associated with Group Reinsurance relates to adverse experience and loss development for the personal accident business recorded in 1999, which exceeded $6.0 million of exit costs incurred from the Management Services Organization ("MSO") business and $11.0 million of adverse development on the medical stop loss business in 2000. The decision to shut down the MSO business was based on lack of demand as providers were backing away from risk contracting. Net earned premiums for Group Operations in 2000 increased $104.0 million as compared with 1999. This increase was principally a result of a $41.0 million increase in Group Benefits, primarily related to the group life line of business; a $35.0 million increase in Life Reinsurance; an $18.0 million increase in Group Reinsurance, and a $10.0 million increase in Federal Markets. The increases in Group Benefits and Life Reinsurance relate to new business production. Life Life Operations provides financial protection to individuals through a full product line of term life insurance, universal life insurance, long term care insurance, annuities and other products. Life Operations also provides retirement services products to institutions in the form of various investment products and administration services. 2001 Compared with 2000 Net operating income decreased by $98.5 million in 2001 as compared with 2000. This decrease relates primarily to restructuring and other related charges of $39.4 million, decreased net investment income from limited partnerships of $19.3 million, estimated losses related to the WTC event of $12.3 million and adverse mortality in the viatical settlement business of $8.8 million. Included in the restructuring and other related charges was a $20.1 million write off of deferred acquisition costs on in force variable life and annuity contracts, as CNA believes that its decision to discontinue these products will negatively impact the persistency of the business. Sales volume for Life Operations decreased by $167.0 million in 2001 as compared with 2000. This decline was driven primarily by declines in the sales of variable annuities and as a result of the decision to cease purchasing new viatical policies. These declines were partially offset by increased renewals and increased new sales in Long Term Care products. Net earned premiums increased $78.0 million in 2001 as compared with 2000. This improvement is attributable primarily to improved sales of structured settlements because of favorable pricing conditions and Long Term Care products, partially offset by a decrease in new Individual Life business. 2000 Compared with 1999 Net operating income increased $31.1 million in 2000 as compared with 1999. The increase was attributable principally to increased earnings in the Index 500 product, the continued growth of Individual Life insurance in force, favorable investment results in Individual Life and the Retirement Services and increased income from limited partnerships of $7.8 million. Sales volume for Life Operations declined $478.0 million in 2000 as compared with 1999. Sales volume decreased because of a reduction in Retirement Services products sold to institutions. These products tend to be "large case" institutional markets sales, which can be sporadic, opportunistic and sensitive to independent agency ratings. Despite the overall decline, Life Operations competitively priced product portfolio enabled most of its businesses to experience growth in 2000. Individual Life and Long Term Care products had an increasing base of direct premiums, and variable investment contracts experienced growth of $270.0 million to reach an annual sales level of $380.0 million in 2000. Net earned premiums declined $60.0 million in 2000 as compared with 1999. This decline was attributable primarily to sales declines in structured settlements and single premium group annuities due to a competitive pricing environment. 49 These declines were partially offset by a growing in force block of Long Term Care and annuity products. Other Insurance The Other insurance segment contains CNAs corporate interest expense, certain run off insurance operations, including Personal Insurance, losses and expenses related to the centralized adjusting and settlement of APMT claims, direct financial guarantee business underwritten by CNAs insurance affiliates, certain non insurance operations, including eBusiness initiatives and CNA UniSource, and eliminations. 2001 Compared with 2000 Net operating results declined $777.5 million in 2001 as compared with 2000. The after tax impact of the second quarter 2001 reserve strengthening on the Other Insurance segment was $695.2 million, including $644.7 million for APMT. See the following Environmental Pollution and Other Mass Tort and Asbestos Reserves section for a discussion of this charge. Net operating income for 2001 also decreased by $67.4 million for restructuring and other related charges, $39.0 million for the non recurring ceding commission included in 2000 results related to the transfer of the Personal Insurance business to Allstate in 1999, $30.6 million related to increased eBusiness initiatives in 2001, and $12.3 million due to decreased limited partnership income. These declines were partially offset by lower interest expense on corporate borrowings in 2001 as compared with 2000 and a non recurring favorable adjustment of expense recoveries under a service contract related to Personal Insurance. Total operating revenues, excluding eliminations, decreased $104.0 million in 2001 as compared with 2000. This decline was due to a decrease in net investment income and net earned premiums from run off insurance operations, particularly the entertainment and agriculture insurance lines. 2000 Compared with 1999 Net operating results improved $165.9 million for 2000 as compared with 1999. This improvement is due to lower adverse development related to asbestos claims in 2000 as compared with 1999 and improvements in Personal Insurance, including $45.0 million for non recurring ceding commission in 2000 as compared with $33.0 million in 1999, partially offset by expenses for CNAs eBusiness initiatives. Total operating revenues, excluding eliminations, decreased $1,578.0 million in 2000 as compared with 1999. This decline is driven primarily by a $1,421.0 million decrease in net earned premiums attributable primarily to the sale of Personal Insurance to Allstate in 1999. Net earned premiums for 1999 included $1,354.0 million of premiums related to Personal Insurance. The remaining decline in net earned premiums was primarily a result of CNA exiting the entertainment insurance and other financial lines of business. Additionally, operating revenues declined as a result of decreased net investment income. Environmental Pollution and Other Mass Tort and Asbestos Reserves CNAs property casualty insurance subsidiaries have potential exposures related to APMT claims. Environmental pollution cleanup is the subject of both federal and state regulation. By some estimates, there are thousands of potential waste sites subject to cleanup. The insurance industry is involved in extensive litigation regarding coverage issues. Judicial interpretations in many cases have expanded the scope of coverage and liability beyond the original intent of the policies. The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ("Superfund") and comparable state statutes ("mini Superfunds") govern the cleanup and restoration of toxic waste sites and formalize the concept of legal liability for cleanup and restoration by "Potentially Responsible Parties" ("PRPs"). Superfund and the mini Superfunds establish mechanisms to pay for cleanup of waste sites if PRPs fail to do so, and to assign liability to PRPs. The extent of liability to be allocated to a PRP is dependent upon a variety of factors. Further, the number of waste sites subject to cleanup is unknown. To date, approximately 1,500 cleanup sites have been identified by the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and included on its National Priorities List ("NPL"). State authorities have designated many cleanup sites as well. Many policyholders have made claims against various CNA insurance subsidiaries for defense costs and indemnification in connection with environmental pollution matters. These claims relate to accident years 1989 and prior, which coincides with CNAs adoption of the Simplified Commercial General Liability coverage form, which includes what is referred to in the industry as an "absolute pollution exclusion." CNA and the insurance industry are disputing coverage for many such claims. Key coverage issues include whether cleanup costs are considered damages under the policies, trigger of coverage, allocation of liability among triggered policies, applicability of pollution exclusions and owned property exclusions, the potential for joint and several liability and the definition of an occurrence. To date, courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues. A number of proposals to reform Superfund have been made by various parties. However, no reforms were enacted by Congress during 2001, and it is unclear what positions Congress or the administration will take and what legislation, if any, will result in the future. If there is legislation, and in some circumstances even if there is no legislation, the federal role in environmental cleanup may be significantly reduced in favor of state action. Substantial changes in the federal statute or the activity of the EPA may cause states to reconsider their environmental cleanup statutes and regulations. There can be no meaningful prediction of the pattern of regulation that would result or the effect upon CNAs results of operations and or financial position. Due to the inherent uncertainties described above, including the inconsistency of court decisions, the number of waste sites subject to cleanup, and the standards for cleanup and liability, the ultimate liability of CNA for environmental pollution claims may vary substantially from the amount currently recorded. 50 As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, CNA carried approximately $617.0 and $347.0 million of claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, net of reinsurance recoverables, for reported and unreported environmental pollution and other mass tort claims. Unfavorable environmental pollution and other mass tort net claim and claim adjustment expense reserve development for the year ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 amounted to $473.0 and $17.0 million. Favorable environmental pollution and other mass tort net claim and claim adjustment expense reserve development for the year ended December 31, 1999 amounted to $84.0 million. The Company made environmental pollution related claim payments and other mass tort related claim payments, net of reinsurance recoveries, of $203.0, $135.0 and $236.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The reserve development during 2001 for environmental pollution and other mass tort reserves was due to reviews completed during the year, which indicated that paid and reported losses were higher than expectations based on prior reviews. Factors that have led to this development include a number of declaratory judgments filed this year due to an increasingly favorable legal environment for policyholders in certain courts and other unfavorable decisions regarding cleanup issues. CNAs property casualty insurance subsidiaries also have exposure to asbestos related claims. Estimation of asbestos related claim and claim adjustment expense reserves involves many of the same limitations discussed above for environmental pollution claims, such as inconsistency of court decisions, specific policy provisions, allocation of liability among insurers and insureds, and additional factors such as missing policies and proof of coverage. Furthermore, estimation of asbestos related claims is difficult due to, among other reasons, the proliferation of bankruptcy proceedings and attendant uncertainties, the targeting of a broader range of businesses and entities as defendants, the uncertainty as to which other insureds may be targeted in the future and the uncertainties inherent in predicting the number of future claims. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, CNA carried approximately $1,204.0 and $603.0 million of net claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, net of reinsurance recoverables, for reported and unreported asbestos related claims. Unfavorable asbestos related net claim and claim adjustment expense reserve development for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 amounted to $772.0, $65.0 and $560.0 million, respectively. CNA made asbestos related claim payments, net of reinsurance, of $171.0, $126.0 and $161.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, excluding payments made in connection with the 1993 settlement of litigation related to Fibreboard Corporation. CNA has attempted to manage its asbestos related exposures by aggressively resolving old accounts. The reserve development during 2001 for asbestos related claims was based on a management review of developments with respect to these exposures conducted during the year. This analysis indicated a significant increase in claim counts for asbestos related claims. The factors that have led to the deterioration in claim counts include, among other things, intensive advertising campaigns by lawyers for asbestos claimants and the addition of new defendants such as the distributors and installers of products containing asbestos. New claim filings increased significantly in 2000 over 1999 and that trend continued during 2001. The volume of new claims has caused the bankruptcies of numerous asbestos defendants. Those bankruptcies also may result in increased liability for remaining defendants under principles of joint and several liability. In addition, some asbestos related defendants have asserted that their claims for insurance are not subject to aggregate limits on coverage. CNA currently has such claims from a number of insureds. Some of these claims involve insureds facing exhaustion of products liability aggregate limits in their policies, who have asserted that their asbestos related claims fall within so called "non products" liability coverage contained within their policies rather than products liability coverage, and that the claimed "non products" coverage is not subject to any aggregate limit. It is difficult to predict the ultimate size of any of the claims for coverage not subject to aggregate limits or predict to what extent, if any, the attempts to assert "non products" claims outside the products liability aggregate will succeed. Due to the uncertainties created by volatility in claim numbers and settlement demands, the effect of bankruptcies, the extent to which non impaired claimants can be precluded from making claims and the efforts by insureds to obtain coverage not subject to aggregate limits, the ultimate liability of CNA for asbestos related claims may vary substantially from the amount currently recorded. Other variables that will influence CNAs ultimate exposure to asbestos related claims include medical inflation trends, jury attitudes, the strategies of plaintiff attorneys to broaden the scope of defendants, the mix of asbestos related diseases presented and the possibility of legislative reform. Adverse developments with respect to such matters discussed herein could have a material adverse effect on CNAs results of operations and or financial condition. The results of operations and financial condition of CNA in future years may continue to be adversely affected by environmental pollution and other mass tort and asbestos claim and claim adjustment expenses. Management will continue to review and monitor these liabilities and make further adjustments, including further reserve strengthening as warranted. 51 Lorillard Lorillard, Inc. and subsidiaries ("Lorillard"). Lorillard, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. 2001 Compared with 2000 Revenues increased by $186.1 million, or 4.3% and net income decreased $81.7 million, or 10.8%, respectively, in 2001 as compared to 2000. Net sales increased due to higher average unit prices which would have resulted in an aggregate increase of approximately $543.5 million, or 12.8%, partially offset by a decrease of approximately $336.0 million, or 7.9%, reflecting lower unit sales volume for 2001 as compared to 2000. During 2001, Lorillard increased its net wholesale price of cigarettes by an average of $13.58 per thousand cigarettes ($.27 per pack of 20 cigarettes), or 12.8%. Federal excise taxes are included in the price of cigarettes and have remained constant at $17.00 per thousand units, or $.34 per pack of 20 cigarettes. On January 1, 2002, the federal excise tax on cigarettes increased by $2.50 per thousand cigarettes ($0.05 per pack of 20 cigarettes). All of the states also levy excise taxes on cigarettes. Various states have proposed, and certain states have recently passed, increases in their state tobacco excise taxes. Such actions may adversely affect Lorillards volume, operating revenues and operating income. Lorillards overall unit sales volume decreased by 6.5% in 2001, as compared to 2000. Newports unit sales volume increased by .04% for 2001, primarily as a result of the introduction of the Newport Medium line extension and strengthened promotional support, as compared to 2000. The decrease in Lorillards overall unit sales volume reflects lower unit sales of its Maverick and Old Gold brands in the discount market segment due primarily to increased competition in the discount segment and continued limitations imposed by Philip Morriss merchandising arrangements and general competitive conditions. Overall, industry unit sales volume decreased by 3.2% for the year ended December 31, 2001. Lorillards share of wholesale cigarette shipments was 9.5% in 2001, as compared to 9.8% for 2000. Newport, a premium brand, accounted for approximately 85% of Lorillards unit sales for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to 79% in 2000. Newports market share of the premium segment was 10.9% for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to 10.5% in 2000. Lorillard recorded pretax charges of $1,140.4 and $1,076.5 million ($694.2 and $642.3 million after taxes), for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, to accrue its obligations under various settlement agreements. Lorillards portion of ongoing adjusted payments and legal fees is based on its share of domestic cigarette shipments in the year preceding that in which the payment is due. Accordingly, Lorillard records its portions of ongoing settlement payments as part of cost of manufactured products sold as the related sales occur. Funds required for the industry payment obligations have been provided by Lorillards operating activities. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The State Settlement Agreements impose a stream of future payment obligations on Lorillard and the other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers and the Master Settlement Agreement places significant restrictions on their ability to market and sell cigarettes. The Company believes that the implementation of the State Settlement Agreements will materially adversely affect its consolidated results of operations and cash flows in future periods. The degree of the adverse impact will depend, among other things, on the rates of decline in U.S. cigarette sales in the premium and discount segments, Lorillards share of the domestic premium and discount segments, and the effect of any resulting cost advantage of manufacturers not subject to the State Settlement Agreements. Net income declined for the year ended December 31, 2001, due to a charge of $121.0 million (net of taxes) to record the effect of the Engle agreement discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources. Excluding this charge, net income would have increased by $39.3 million, or 5.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2001, as compared to 2000. This increase in net income was primarily due to the impact of wholesale price increases, partially offset by lower unit sales volume and increased sales promotional expenses, mostly in the form of coupons and other discounts provided to retailers and passed through to the consumer. In accordance with industry practice, promotional support in the form of coupons and other discounts is recorded as an expense under "Other operating expenses" rather than reducing net sales. In the first quarter of 2002, Lorillard will be required to adopt the provisions of the FASBs Emerging Issues Task Force Issues No. 00 14, "Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives," and No. 00 25, "Vendor Income Statement Characterization of Consideration from a Vendor to a Retailer." As a result of both issues, promotional expenses historically included in other operating expenses will be reclassified to cost of manufactured products sold, or as reductions of net sales. Beginning with the first quarter of 2002, prior period amounts will be reclassified for comparative purposes. 2000 Compared with 1999 Revenues and net income increased by $277.9 and $102.0 million, or 6.8% and 15.6%, respectively, in 2000 as compared to 1999. Net sales increased as compared to 1999, by approximately $550.3 million, or 13.8%, due to higher average unit prices, including $200.1 million from the increase in federal excise tax, partially offset by a decrease of approximately $307.8 million, or 7.7%, reflecting lower unit sales volume in 2000. Net investment income contributed $35.9 million to the increased revenues. During 2000, Lorillard increased the wholesale price of its cigarettes by an aggregate of $16.50 per thousand cigarettes ($0.33 per pack of 20 cigarettes). Federal excise taxes included in the price of cigarettes are $17.00 per thousand cigarettes ($0.34 per pack of 20 cigarettes). Net income increased due primarily to the increased revenues discussed above, partially offset by the charges for tobacco litigation settlements and higher legal expenses. Net income for the years ended 52 December 31, 2000 and 1999 includes pretax charges of $1,076.5 and $1,065.8 million ($642.3 and $637.3 million after taxes), respectively, related to the settlement of tobacco litigation. Lorillards portion of ongoing adjusted payments and legal fees is based on its share of domestic cigarette shipments in the year preceding that in which the payment is due. Accordingly, Lorillard records its portions of ongoing settlement payments as part of cost of manufactured products sold as the related sales occur. Funds required to meet the industry payment obligations have been provided by Lorillards operating activities. Lorillards overall unit sales volume decreased by 7.0% as compared to 1999. Newport, a full price brand, which accounted for approximately 79% of Lorillards unit sales in 2000, increased by 1.5% as compared to 1999. Newports increase in unit sales volume reflects increased promotional activities to the extent practicable in light of existing limitations due to competitive conditions. The decrease in Lorillards overall unit sales volume reflects lower unit sales of its Maverick and Old Gold brands in the discount market segment. Discount brand sales have remained relatively constant at 26.3%, 26.4% and 26.2% as a percentage of industry sales for 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Newports market share increased 0.1% to 7.7% in 2000, as compared to 7.6% in 1999. Overall industry unit sales volume is up by .02% in 2000, as compared to 1999. Loews Hotels Loews Hotels Holding Corporation and subsidiaries ("Loews Hotels"). Loews Hotels Holding Corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. 2001 Compared with 2000 Revenues and net income decreased by $16.7 and $7.3 million, or 4.9% and 27.2%, respectively, in 2001 compared to 2000. Revenues decreased primarily due to lower occupancy rates and lower average room rates, partially offset by the addition of the Philadelphia hotel, which commenced operations in spring of 2000. The decline in revenues reflects the continued economic weakness and the impact that the September 11, 2001 World Trade Center attack had on the travel industry. Net income decreased due primarily to lower revenues and increased depreciation expenses related to the Philadelphia hotel, partially offset by lower advertising and administrative expenses and lower pre opening costs. 2000 Compared with 1999 Revenues and income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles decreased by $13.4 and $43.7 million, or 3.8% and 62.0%, respectively, in 2000 as compared to 1999. Included in 1999 is a gain of $85.1 million ($52.0 million after taxes) from the sale of two franchised properties. Excluding this gain, revenues and income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles increased by $71.7 and $8.3 million, respectively. Revenues and income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles increased due primarily to increased overall average room rates and the addition of two luxury properties to the Loews Hotels portfolio, offsetting the 1999 sale of the two franchised properties. Overall occupancy rates remained at approximately 78%, essentially unchanged from 1999. Income also benefited from improved operating results of an unconsolidated joint venture whose operations commenced in 1999. Diamond Offshore Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and subsidiaries ("Diamond Offshore"). Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. is a 53% owned subsidiary of the Company. 2001 Compared with 2000 Revenues increased by $218.7 million, or 30.2%, and net income increased by $39.0 million, in 2001 as compared to 2000. Revenues and net income included a gain from the sale of a drilling rig of $13.9 and $4.7 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2000. Revenues from high specification floaters and other semisubmersible rigs increased by $179.3 million, or 24.8%, in 2001 as compared to 2000. These increases reflect higher utilization ($23.6 million) and dayrates ($94.2 million) for 2001 as compared 2000. Revenue generated by the Ocean Confidence, which began a five year drilling program in the Gulf of Mexico on January 5, 2001 after completion of a conversion to a high specification semisubmersible drilling unit ($61.5 million), also contributed to the increase in revenues. Revenues from jack up rigs increased by $55.6 million, or 7.7%, due primarily to increased dayrates ($63.6 million) for 2001, partially offset by lower utilization in 2001. 53 Net income increased due primarily to the increased revenues discussed above, partially offset by increased interest and depreciation expenses. Depreciation expenses increased in 2001 primarily due to the Ocean Confidence, which completed its conversion from an accommodation vessel to a high specification semisubmersible drilling unit and commenced operations in January 2001. Interest expense increased due also to the Ocean Confidence as a result of less interest capitalized. 2000 Compared with 1999 Revenues and net income decreased by $123.3 and $40.7 million, or 14.6% and 56.0%, respectively, in 2000 as compared to 1999. Revenues decreased due principally to lower operating dayrates ($143.9 million) and reduced utilization ($50.6 million) for Diamond Offshores semisubmersible rigs, partially offset by increased utilization ($35.1 million) and higher dayrates ($26.4 million) for jack up rigs during 2000, as compared to 1999. Revenues also declined by $17.1 million due to the sale of a jack up rig and $6.0 million due to the mobilization of rigs to new markets during 2000. These declines were partially offset by increased investment income ($14.5 million) and a gain from the sale of a drilling rig of $13.9 million ($4.7 million after taxes and minority interest) in 2000. Net income declined due primarily to the lower revenues discussed above and the fact that contract drilling costs remained relatively unchanged. Operating expenses generally are not affected by changes in dayrates, nor are they significantly affected by fluctuations in utilization. For instance, if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time, Diamond Offshore realizes few decreases in operating expenses since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared state with a full crew. In addition, when a rig is idle, Diamond Offshore is responsible for certain operating expenses such as rig fuel and supply boat costs, which are typically charged to the operator under drilling contracts. However, if the rig is to be idle for an extended period of time, Diamond Offshore may reduce the size of a rigs crew and take steps to "cold stack" the rig, which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating income. Bulova Bulova Corporation and subsidiaries ("Bulova"). Bulova Corporation is a 97% owned subsidiary of the Company. 2001 Compared with 2000 Revenues and net income decreased by $14.0 and $4.9 million, or 8.7% and 32.7%, respectively, in 2001 compared to 2000. Revenues and net income decreased due primarily to royalty income of $5.5 and $3.0 million, respectively, reported in 2000 related to the settlement of a contract dispute. The remaining decline in revenues for 2001 reflects lower watch and clock unit sales volume due primarily to the continued economic downturn, partially offset by higher watch unit prices. Net income decreased due to the lower revenues and costs incurred during business process reengineering of Bulovas information systems, partially offset by improved gross margins attributable to Bulovas product sales mix. 2000 Compared with 1999 Revenues and net income increased by $21.4 and $.9 million, or 15.4% and 6.4%, respectively, in 2000 as compared to 1999. Revenues increased due to an increase in royalty income of $5.5 million from the settlement of a contract dispute, and higher watch unit sales volume. These increases were partially offset by lower watch prices and lower clock unit sales in 2000, as compared to 1999. Watch prices declined due primarily to a change in sales mix. Net income increased due primarily to the higher revenues discussed above, partially offset by increased brand support and advertising expenses, and a lower effective income tax rate in 1999 due to a valuation allowance adjustment related to prior years. Corporate Corporate operations consist primarily of investment income, including investment gains (losses) from non insurance subsidiaries, as well as equity earnings from a shipping joint venture, corporate interest expenses and other corporate administrative costs. The components of investment gains (losses) included in Corporate operations are as follows: Year ended December 31 2001 2000 1999 (In millions) Derivative instruments (a) $18.2 $(146.5) $(424.1) Equity securities, including short positions (a) 69.1 125.1 (56.5) Short term investments 28.5 (3.3) 9.4 Other 12.6 17.3 (1.6) 128.4 (7.4) (472.8) Income tax (expense) benefit (45.0) 2.6 172.1 Minority interest (8.3) Net gain (loss) $75.1 $ (4.8) $(300.7) (a) Includes losses on short sales, equity index futures and options aggregating $533.6 for the year ended December 31, 1999. Substantially all of the index short positions were closed during the second quarter of 2000. See "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." 2001 Compared with 2000 Exclusive of investment gains (losses), revenues decreased $19.1 million and net loss increased $3.0 million, or 11.5% and 21.1%, respectively, in 2001 compared to 2000, due primarily to lower investment income. This change was partially offset by increased operating results from a shipping joint venture reflecting increased demand and charter rates in the crude oil tanker markets. 2000 Compared with 1999 Exclusive of investment gains (losses), revenues increased by $42.7 million and net loss decreased by $15.9 million, or 34.7% and 52.0%, respectively, due to higher investment income reflecting an increased base of invested assets, and improved results from a shipping joint venture, partially offset by increased administrative and interest expenses. 54 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CNA The principal operating cash flow sources of CNAs property casualty and life insurance subsidiaries are premiums and investment income. The primary operating cash flow uses are payments for claims, policy benefits and operating expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2001, net cash used for operating activities was $599.0 million as compared with net cash used of $1,345.5 and $2,823.0 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively. The improvement related primarily to decreased paid claims. The improvement in 2000 relates primarily to significant payments in 1999 for (i) $1.1 billion in cash to Allstate in connection with the transaction involving CNAs Personal Insurance business and (ii) $1.1 billion of claim payments from escrow pursuant to the Fibreboard settlement. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the Personal Insurance transaction. Excluding these significant, non recurring transactions from 1999, CNAs 2000 cash outflow from operations declined by approximately $600.0 million to an outflow of approximately $1.4 billion. The operating cash flows forgone in 2000 due to the transfer of Personal Insurance in 1999 was approximately $250.0 million. The remainder of the decline related primarily to increased payments of claims and decreased receipts of premiums. Cash flows from investing activities include purchases and sales of financial instruments, as well as the purchase and sale of land, buildings, equipment and other assets not generally held for resale. For the year ended December 31, 2001, net cash used for investment activities was $205.1 million as compared with net cash inflows of $1,842.0 million in 2000. Cash flows for investing activities were related principally to increased net purchases of invested assets related to investing $1.0 billion of proceeds from the common stock rights offering completed in the third quarter of 2001. For the year ended December 31, 2000, net cash inflows from investment activities were $1,842.0 million as compared with $3,317.0 million in 1999. Cash flows from investing activities were particularly high in 1999 due to sales of investments to fund the outflows related to the Personal Insurance transaction and Fibreboard claim payments. Cash flows from financing activities include proceeds from the issuance of debt or equity securities, outflows for dividends or repayment of debt and outlays to reacquire equity instruments. For the year ended December 31, 2001, net cash provided from financing activities was $783.0 million as compared with $487.0 million of net cash used in 2000. CNA completed a common stock rights offering on September 26, 2001, successfully raising $1.0 billion (40.3 million shares sold at $25 per share). Loews purchased 38.3 million shares issued in connection with the rights offering for $957.1 million, and an additional .8 million shares in the open market, increasing its ownership percentage of CNA to 89%. Additionally, CNA borrowed $500.0 million against its bank credit facility. Partially offsetting these cash inflows were reductions to CNAs commercial paper borrowings of $627.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2000, net cash used for financing activities was $487.0 million as compared with $558.0 million in 1999. During 2000 and 1999, cash flows for financing activities included the repurchase of preferred and common equity instruments, the retirement or repurchase of senior debt securities and mortgages, the repayment of bank loans and the payment of preferred dividends. CNA is closely managing the cash flows related to claims and reinsurance recoverables from the WTC event. It is anticipated that significant claim payments will be made prior to receipt of the corresponding reinsurance recoverables. CNA does not anticipate any liquidity problems resulting from these payments. As of March 1, 2002, CNA has paid $273.0 million in claims and recovered $90.0 million from reinsurers. CNAs estimated gross pretax losses for the WTC event were $1,648.0 million, ($937.2 million after tax and minority interest). Net pretax losses before the effect of the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties were $727.0 million. Approximately 41.0%, 40.0% and 17.0% of the reinsurance recoverables on the estimated losses related to the WTC event are from companies with S&P ratings of AAA, AA or A, respectively. Effective January 30, 2001, CNA sold the 180 Maiden Lane, New York, facility. The sale of this property provided additional liquidity to CNA with net sale proceeds of $264.0 million. During 2001, CNA discontinued its commercial paper program and repaid all loans outstanding under the program. The funds used to retire the outstanding commercial paper debt were obtained through the draw down of the full amount available under CNAs $500.0 million revolving credit facility. The facility is composed of two parts: a $250.0 million component with a 364 day expiration date (with an option to convert into a one year term loan) and a $250.0 million component with a three year expiration date. CNA pays a facility fee to the lenders for having funds available for loans under both components of the facility; the fee varies based on the long term debt ratings of CNA. At December 31, 2001 the facility fee on the 364 day component was 15 basis points and the facility fee on the three year component was 17.5 basis points. In addition to the facility fees, CNA pays interest on outstanding debt/borrowings under the facility based on a rate determined using the long term debt ratings of CNA. The current interest rate is equal to the London Interbank Offering Rate ("LIBOR") plus 60 basis points for the 364 day component and LIBOR plus 57.5 basis points for the 55 three year component. Further, if CNA has outstanding loans greater than 50% of the amounts available under the facility, CNA also pays a utilization fee of 12.5 basis points on such loans. A Moodys downgrade of the CNA senior debt rating from Baa2 to Baa3 would increase the facility fee on the 364 day component of the facility from 15 basis points to 20 basis points, and the facility fee on the three year component would increase from 17.5 basis points to 25 basis points. The applicable interest rate on the 364 day component would increase from LIBOR plus 60 basis points to LIBOR plus 80 basis points and the applicable interest rate on the three year component would increase from LIBOR plus 57.5 basis points to LIBOR plus 75 basis points. The utilization fee would remain unchanged on both components at 12.5 basis points. The $500.0 million revolving credit facility replaced CNAs $750.0 million revolving credit facility (the "Prior Facility"), which was scheduled to expire on May 10, 2001. No loans were outstanding under the Prior Facility anytime during 2001. To offset the variable rate characteristics of the Prior Facility and the interest rate risk associated with periodically reissuing commercial paper, in 1999 and 2000 CNA entered into interest rate swap agreements with several banks. These agreements required CNA to pay interest at a fixed rate in exchange for the receipt of the three month LIBOR. The effect of the interest rate swap agreements was to decrease interest expense by approximately $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 and increase interest expense by $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. The terms of CNAs credit facility requires CNA to maintain certain financial ratios and combined property casualty company statutory surplus levels. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, CNA was in compliance with all restrictive debt covenants. Following the announcement of second quarter 2001 earnings, CNAs commercial paper rating was placed under review by S&P. During the review period, CNA, through an affiliated company held varying amounts of its commercial paper with the intent to put it back into the market after the review was completed. On October 10, 2001, S&P lowered CNAs commercial paper rating from A2 to A3, and maintained the CreditWatch Negative status. On December 28, 2001, Moodys lowered the long term debt rating from Baa1 to Baa2 and affirmed the P2 short term debt rating. The commercial paper rating downgrade, the impacts of the WTC event and an overall decline in the market made it difficult to maintain a commercial paper program. Following consultation with CNAs commercial and investment bankers, management determined that the most economical way to replace the commercial paper was to draw on the revolving bank credit facility. In the normal course of business, CNA has obtained letters of credit in favor of various unaffiliated insurance companies, regulatory authorities and other entities. At December 31, 2001 there were approximately $270.0 million of outstanding letters of credit, of which approximately $30.0 million are collateralized with cash and securities. CNA has committed approximately $152.0 million to future capital calls from various third party limited partnership investments in exchange for an ownership interest in the related partnerships. CNA has a commitment to purchase a $100.0 million floating rate note issued by the Californian Earthquake Authority in the event California earthquake related insurance losses exceed $4.9 billion prior to December 31, 2002. CNA has entered into a limited number of guaranteed payment contracts. These relate primarily to telecom service contracts and amount to payments of approximately $41.0 million guaranteed for 2002 through 2005. Additionally, CNA is obligated to future payments totaling $596.0 million for non cancelable operating leases expiring from 2002 through 2014 primarily for office space, data processing, office and transportation equipment. Ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. CNAs insurance company subsidiaries are rated by major rating agencies, and these ratings reflect the rating agencys opinion of the insurance companys financial strength, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization. Each agencys rating should be evaluated independently of any other agencys rating. The table below reflects ratings issued by A.M. Best, S&P, Moodys and Fitch as of February 13, 2002 for the Continental Casualty Company ("CCC") Pool, the Continental Insurance Company ("CIC") Pool and the Continental Assurance Company ("CAC") Pool. Also rated were CNAs senior debt and commercial paper and The Continental Corporations ("Continental") senior debt. Debt Ratings Insurance Ratings CNA Continental Financial Strength Senior Commercial Senior CCC Pool CAC Pool CIC Pool Debt Paper Debt A.M. Best A A A BBB AMB 2 BBB Fitch A AA NR BBB NR NR Moodys A3 A2 (Negative)* A3 Baa2 P2 Baa3 S&P A A+ A BBB A3 BBB NR Not Rated * CAC and Valley Forge Life Insurance Company ("VFL") are rated separately by Moodys and both have an A2 rating. 56 On February 13, 2002, Fitch removed the rating watch negative status and affirmed the insurance financial strength rating of CCC and the senior debt rating of CNA. On September 24, 2001, following the WTC event, Fitch affirmed the ratings of CAC and placed CCC under review. On February 1, 2002 S&P affirmed the debt and financial strength ratings of CNA and the CNA insurance companies. The outlook was changed from CreditWatch Negative to stable. This action occurred after managements discussions with S&P in early January of 2002, and upon completion of their evaluation of additional information provided to them with respect to the WTC event reserve estimate (including additional sensitivity analyses of the reserve estimates) and other capital adequacy analyses. Additionally, CNA and S&P London have agreed to a guarantee of the Continental Insurance Company of Europe ("CIE")/Maritime Insurance Co., Ltd. liabilities by CCC in order to maintain their present rating of "A ". This matter is expected to be concluded by the second quarter of 2002, as the guarantee requires the approval of the Illinois Department of Insurance (the "Department"). On December 28, 2001, Moodys lowered the insurance financial strength rating of the CCC Pool to A3 (stable). In addition, Moodys lowered the CNA long term debt and preferred stock ratings to Baa2 and Ba1, and the Continental senior debt rating to Baa3. The previously affirmed ratings of CIC, CAC and commercial paper remained unchanged with the rating action. These rating actions concluded the review begun on August 2, 2001 in connection with the second quarter 2001 reserve strengthening. In light of subsequent events, management further discussed with Moodys the WTC event and the fourth quarter restructuring charge. All of these items were contemplated in their current rating opinion and outlook. CNA held $275.0 million of Continental preferred shares. The $29.0 million annual Continental preferred share dividend was funded by CIC. Although the capital position of the CIC Pool remains strong, CICs ability to dividend funds to its parent, Continental, is limited by regulatory constraints. In order to alleviate intercompany dividend requirements, the Continental preferred stock has been converted to Continental common stock in the fourth quarter of 2001. CNAs ability to pay dividends and other credit obligations is significantly dependent on receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries. The payment of dividends to CNA by its insurance subsidiaries without prior approval of the insurance department of each subsidiarys domiciliary jurisdiction is limited by formula. Dividends in excess of these amounts are subject to prior approval of the respective state insurance departments. Dividends from the CCC Pool are subject to the insurance holding company laws of the State of Illinois, the domiciliary state of CCC. Under these laws, ordinary dividends, or dividends that do not require prior approval of the Department, may be paid only from earned surplus, which is calculated by removing unrealized gains (which under statutory accounting includes cumulative earnings of CCCs subsidiaries) from unassigned surplus. As of December 31, 2001, CCC is in a negative earned surplus position. In February of 2002, the Department approved an extraordinary dividend in the amount of $117.0 million to be used to fund CNAs 2002 debt service requirements. Until CCC is in a positive earned surplus position, all dividends require prior approval of the Department. In addition, by agreement with the New Hampshire Insurance Department, as well as certain other state insurance departments, dividend payments for the CIC Pool are restricted to internal and external debt service requirements through September 2003 up to a maximum of $85.0 million annually, without the prior approval of the New Hampshire Insurance Department. Lorillard Lorillard and other cigarette manufacturers continue to be confronted with substantial litigation and regulatory issues. Lawsuits continue to be filed against Lorillard and other manufacturers of tobacco products. Approximately 4,675 product liability cases are pending against cigarette manufacturers in the United States. Of these, approximately 1,250 cases are pending in a West Virginia court, and approximately 2,850 cases are brought by flight attendants alleging injury from exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the cabins of aircraft. Lorillard is a defendant in all of the flight attendant suits served to date and is a defendant in most of the cases pending in West Virginia. On July 14, 2000, the jury in Engle v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., et al. awarded a total of $145.0 billion in punitive damages against all defendants, including $16.3 billion against Lorillard. The judgment also provides that the jurys awards bear interest at the rate of 10% per year. Lorillard remains of the view that the Engle case should not have been certified as a class action. That certification is inconsistent with the majority of federal and state court decisions which have held that mass smoking and health claims are inappropriate for class treatment. Lorillard has challenged class certification, as well as other numerous legal errors that it believes occurred during the trial. The Company and Lorillard believe that an appeal of these issues on the merits should prevail. Lorillard noticed an appeal from the final judgment to the Third District of the Florida Court of Appeal and posted its appellate bond in the amount of $100.0 million pursuant to Florida legislation limiting the amount of an appellate bond required to be posted in order to stay execution of a judgment for punitive damages in a certified class action. While Lorillard believes this legislation is valid and that any challenges to the possible application or constitutionality of this legislation would fail, during May of 2001, Lorillard and two other defendants jointly contributed a total of $709.0 million to a fund that will not be recoverable by them even if challenges to the judgment are resolved in favor of the defendants. As a result, the class has agreed to a stay of execution on its punitive damages judgment until appellate review is completed, including any review by the U.S. Supreme Court. However, if Lorillard, Inc.s balance sheet net worth (as determined in accordance 57 with generally accepted accounting principles in effect as of July 14, 2000) falls below $921.2 million, the stay pursuant to the agreement would terminate and the class would be free to challenge the separate stay granted in favor of Lorillard pursuant to Florida legislation. The Florida legislation limits to $100.0 million the amount of an appellate bond required to be posted in order to stay execution of a judgment for punitive damages in a certified class action. Lorillard contributed a total of $200.0 million to this fund, which included the $100.0 million that was initially posted as its appellate bond. Accordingly, results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2001, include Lorillards second quarter pretax charge of $200.0 million. The terms of the State Settlement Agreements (see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) require significant payments to be made to the Settling States which began in 1998 and continue in perpetuity. Lorillard expects the cash payment to be made under the State Settlement Agreements in 2001 to be approximately $1.1 billion. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding this settlement and other litigation matters. The principal source of liquidity for Lorillards business and operating needs is internally generated funds from its operations. Lorillard generated net cash flow from operations of approximately $709.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $550.4 million for the prior year. The increased cash flow in 2001 reflects timing differences related to the cash payments for estimated taxes partially offset by the lower net income and additional cash payments related to the Engle agreement. Lorillard believes that cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient for the foreseeable future to enable it to meet its obligations under the State Settlement Agreements and to fund its capital expenditures. Lorillard cannot predict its cash requirements related to any future settlements or judgments, including cash required to bond any appeals, if necessary, and can make no assurance that it will be able to meet all of those requirements. Loews Hotels In 2001, Loews Hotels, with its partners, opened a second hotel at Universal Orlando in Florida and is developing a third hotel which is scheduled to open in 2002. Capital expenditures in relation to these hotel projects are being funded by a combination of equity from Loews Hotels and its partners, and mortgages. Funds from operations continue to exceed operating requirements. Funds for other capital expenditures and working capital requirements are expected to be provided from existing cash balances and operations. Diamond Offshore There has historically been a strong correlation between the price of oil and natural gas and the demand for offshore drilling services. As natural gas prices started to decline during the third quarter of 2001, demand for Diamond Offshores jack up fleet in the Gulf of Mexico began to soften. Although Diamond Offshore has maintained jack up fleet utilization higher than the industry average, operating dayrates earned by the fleet have deteriorated. Utilization of Diamond Offshores intermediate semisubmersible fleet in the Gulf of Mexico, which had begun to improve during mid year 2001, declined again during the fourth quarter. Contract renewal dayrates for these rigs have also been lower. Utilization for Diamond Offshores high specification floaters has remained strong throughout 2001. However, towards the end of the year, some deep water capacity has become available in the market, and dayrates have declined slightly. In the international markets, demand has been strong and dayrates have remained at high levels. Diamond Offshore believes that continued strength in both high specification and international markets will depend, in large part, on product prices remaining at current levels. Significant relocations of drilling rigs from the weaker Gulf of Mexico to international markets could also lower dayrates in non U.S. markets. At December 31, 2001, cash and marketable securities totaled $1.1 billion, up from $862.1 million at December 31, 2000. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased by $177.5 million to $374.0 million, as compared to 2000. The increase in cash flow was primarily due to improved results of operations in 2001. On April 6, 2001, Diamond Offshore redeemed all of its outstanding 3.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes (the "Notes") in accordance with the indenture under which the Notes were issued. Prior to April 6, 2001, $12.4 million principal amount of the Notes had been converted into 307,071 shares of Diamond Offshores common stock at the stated conversion price of $40.50 per share. The remaining $387.6 million principal amount of the Notes was redeemed at 102.08% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest, for a total cash payment of $397.7 million. On April 11, 2001, Diamond Offshore issued $460.0 million principal amount of 1.5% convertible senior debentures (the "1.5% Debentures") due April 15, 2031. The 1.5% Debentures are convertible into shares of Diamond Offshores common stock at an initial conversion rate of 20.3978 shares per each $1,000 principal amount, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Upon conversion, Diamond Offshore has the right to deliver cash in lieu of shares of its common stock. The transaction resulted in net proceeds of approximately $449.1 million. During 2001, Diamond Offshore purchased 1,403,900 shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $37.8 million. Depending on market conditions, Diamond Offshore may, from time to time, purchase shares of its common stock in the open market. During the year ended December 31, 2001, Diamond Offshore expended $160.4 million, including capitalized interest expense, for rig upgrades. These expenditures were primarily for the deepwater upgrades of the Ocean Baroness ($114.3 million) and the Ocean 58 Rover ($20.7 million). Included in this amount was $12.6 million for accommodation and stability enhancement upgrades of the Ocean Nomad which were completed in April 2001. In addition, the pre fabrication of equipment required for the upgrade of six of Diamond Offshores jack up rigs accounted for $7.2 million of 2001 rig upgrade expenditures. Diamond Offshore expects to spend approximately $275.0 million for rig upgrade capital expenditures during 2002 which are primarily costs associated with upgrades of the Ocean Rover and six jack up rigs. Approximately $34.0 million of this amount is expected to be used for the completion of the Ocean Baroness upgrade. The significant upgrade of Diamond Offshores semisubmersible, the Ocean Baroness, to high specification capabilities will be completed in early 2002. The approximate cost of the upgrade was $170.0 million. In January 2002, the Ocean Rover arrived at a shipyard in Singapore for a major upgrade to water depths and specifications similar to the enhanced Ocean Baroness. The estimated cost of this upgrade is approximately $200.0 million with approximately $140.0 million to be spent in 2002. The upgrade is expected to take approximately 19 months to complete with delivery estimated to occur in the third quarter of 2003. Diamond Offshore also plans to spend approximately $93.0 million over the next two years to upgrade six of its jack up rigs. The equipment necessary for these upgrades will be pre fabricated and installation is planned to occur during idle time or scheduled surveys to minimize downtime. Diamond Offshore expects to finance these upgrades through the use of existing cash balances or internally generated funds. During the year ended December 31, 2001, Diamond Offshore expended $108.2 million for its continuing rig enhancement program and other corporate requirements. Diamond Offshore has budgeted $107.1 million for 2002 capital expenditures associated with these items. Cash required to meet Diamond Offshores capital commitments is determined by evaluating rig upgrades to meet specific customer requirements and by evaluating Diamond Offshores continuing rig enhancement program, including water depth and drilling capability upgrades. It is managements opinion that operating cash flows and Diamond Offshores cash reserves will be sufficient to meet these capital commitments; however, periodic assessments will be made based on industry conditions. In addition, Diamond Offshore may, from time to time, issue debt or equity securities, or a combination thereof, to finance capital expenditures, the acquisition of assets and businesses, or for general corporate purposes. Diamond Offshores ability to effect any such issuance will be dependent on its results of operations, its current financial and market conditions, and other factors beyond its control. Bulova For the year ended December 31, 2001, net cash provided for operating activities was $15.9 million as compared with net cash used of $15.9 million in 2000. Bulovas cash and cash equivalents, and investments amounted to $18.9 million at December 31, 2001, compared to $16.9 million in 2000. The increase in net cash flow is primarily the result of a decrease in inventory purchases and a higher collection of accounts receivables as compared to the prior year, partially offset by a change in the timing of accounts payable and accrued expenses. Funds for capital expenditures and working capital requirements are expected to be provided from operations and existing cash balances. No material capital expenditures are anticipated during 2002. Majestic Shipping Subsidiaries of Majestic Shipping Corporation ("Majestic"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into agreements with a Korean shipyard for the new building of four 442,500 deadweight ton, ultra large crude carrying ships ("ULCCs"). Hellespont Shipping Corporation ("Hellespont"), a 49% owned subsidiary of Majestic, also entered into agreements with another Korean shipyard for the new building of four 303,000 deadweight ton, very large crude carrying ships ("VLCCs"). In 2001, Hellespont sold its contracts for construction of four supertankers. The gain on the transaction was not material. The total cost of the four remaining ships to be purchased by the subsidiaries of Majestic is estimated to amount to approximately $360.0 million. The financing for these ships will be provided through equity contributions by the Company and bank debt guaranteed by Majestic. The Company has agreed to provide credit support for Majestics bank debt by making available to the borrowers limited operating cash flow credit facilities. Parent Company During 2001, the Company purchased 5,746,600 shares of its outstanding Common Stock at an aggregate cost of $282.2 million. Depending on market conditions, the Company from time to time purchases shares of its, and its subsidiaries, outstanding common stock in the open market or otherwise. In September of 2001, the Company paid $957.1 million to purchase 38.3 million shares of CNA common stock at $25 per share in connection with a rights offering. The Company purchased an additional 836,500 shares of CNA common stock for $21.6 million. As result, the Companys ownership percentage of CNA increased to 89%. On February 6, 2002, the Company sold 40.3 million shares of a new class of its common stock referred to as "Carolina Group" stock for net proceeds of $1.1 billion. Proceeds from this sale have been allocated to the Loews Group and will be used for general corporate purposes. The Company continues to pursue conservative financial strategies while seeking opportunities for responsible growth. These include the expansion of existing businesses, full or partial acquisitions and dispositions, and opportunities for efficiencies and economies of scale. 59 INVESTMENTS Investment activities of non insurance companies include investments in fixed income securities, equity securities including short sales, derivative instruments and short term investments, and are carried at fair value. Equity securities, which are considered part of the Companys trading portfolio, short sales and derivative instruments are marked to market and reported as investment gains or losses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company enters into short sales and invests in certain derivative instruments for a number of purposes, including: (i) asset and liability management activities, (ii) income enhancements for its portfolio management strategy, and (iii) to benefit from anticipated future movements in the underlying markets. If such movements do not occur as anticipated, then significant losses may occur. Monitoring procedures include senior management review of daily detailed reports of existing positions and valuation fluctuations to ensure that open positions are consistent with the Companys portfolio strategy. The credit exposure associated with these instruments is generally limited to the positive market value of the instruments and will vary based on changes in market prices. The Company enters into these transactions with large financial institutions and considers the risk of nonperformance to be remote. The Company does not believe that any of the derivative instruments utilized by it are unusually complex, nor do these instruments contain embedded leverage features which would expose the Company to a higher degree of risk. See "Results of Operations," "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" and Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information with respect to derivative instruments, including recognized gains and losses on these instruments. Insurance The components of CNAs net investment income for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 are presented in the following table. Year Ended December 31 2001 2000 1999 (In millions) Fixed maturity securities: Bonds: Taxable $1,742.0 $1,549.0 $1,509.0 Tax exempt 112.0 216.0 267.0 Redeemable preferred stocks 1.0 1.0 Limited Partnerships 47.0 293.0 115.0 Equity securities 39.0 52.0 36.0 Mortgage loans and real estate 2.0 4.0 4.0 Policy loans 12.0 12.0 11.0 Short term investments 135.0 201.0 188.0 Securities lending transactions, net 29.0 22.0 25.0 Other, including interest on funds withheld and other deposits (164.0) (16.0) 80.0 Gross investment income 1,955.0 2,334.0 2,235.0 Investment expense (58.0) (48.0) (41.0) Net investment income $1,897.0 $2,286.0 $2,194.0 During 2001, CNA reclassified equity method income from limited partnership investments. Effective in 2001, equity method income from limited partnership investments is classified in net investment income and amounts in 2000 and 1999 have been reclassified to conform to the new presentation. This income was previously classified in realized investment gains, net of participating policyholders and minority interests. Income from limited partnership investments decreased $246.0 million for 2001 compared with 2000 and increased $178.0 million for 2000 compared with 1999. During 2000 market conditions allowed for favorable investment results relative to the investment strategies of certain limited partnership investments. In addition, certain partnerships that were very successful during 2000 have been dissolved. Investment results for the same periods in 2001 were, in general, less than expected. CNAs reinsurance program includes certain property casualty contracts, such as the corporate aggregate treaties, that are entered into and accounted for on a funds withheld basis. Under these contracts, CNA records a funds withheld liability for substantially all of the ceded premiums. The reinsurance contract requires CNA to increase the funds withheld balance at a defined interest crediting rate. The funds withheld liability is reduced by any cumulative claim payments made by CNA in excess of CNAs retention under the reinsurance contract. If the funds withheld liability is exhausted, additional claim payments are recoverable from the reinsurer. 60 During 2001, CNA reclassified interest on funds withheld and other deposits. This expense was previously classified in other operating expenses and is now classified in net investment income. Interest on funds withheld and other deposits was $241.0 million in 2001, $87.0 million in 2000 and $22.0 million in 1999. The amount subject to interest crediting rates on such contracts was $2,724.0 million and $522.0 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000. CNA experienced lower net investment income in 2001 as compared with 2000 due primarily to the decrease in limited partnership income as well as the increase in interest on funds withheld and other deposits. Net investment income increased in 2000 as compared with 1999 principally as a result of an increase in limited partnership income, partially offset by an increase in interest expense on funds withheld and other deposits. The bond segment of the investment portfolio yielded 6.4% in 2001, 6.7% in 2000 and 6.1% in 1999. The components of CNAs net investment gains (losses) for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 are presented in the following table: Year Ended December 31 2001 2000 1999 (In millions) Investment gains (losses): Fixed maturity securities: U.S. Government bonds $ 233.4 $ 95.8 $(177.3) Corporate and other taxable bonds (3.8) (171.1) (78.0) Tax exempt bonds 53.9 13.2 (44.5) Asset backed bonds 75.6 (65.0) (13.0) Redeemable Preferred Stock (21.5) (3.2) 1.3 Total fixed maturity securities 337.6 (130.3) (311.5) Equity securities 1,096.4 1,116.0 366.3 Derivative securities (5.0) 10.5 38.6 Other invested assets (163.7) 32.3 105.9 Total realized investment gains 1,265.3 1,028.5 199.3 Income tax expense (446.2) (358.5) (82.6) Minority interest (102.0) (88.1) (16.8) Net investment gains $ 717.1 $ 581.9 $ 99.9 Net realized investment gains increased $135.2 million in 2001 as compared with 2000. This increase was due primarily to gains (after tax and minority interest) from the sale of Global Crossing Ltd. common stock ("Global Crossing") and its related hedge of $566.0 million in 2001 as compared with $274.0 million in 2000, as well as gains of $47.9 million resulting from the sale of a New York real estate property and gains from the sale of fixed maturity security investments. The gains from Global Crossing reported in 2001 are from recognition of hedge arrangements that were entered into in March of 2000. This improvement was partially offset by estimated losses recorded for the planned dispositions of certain operations, principally CNA Res U.K. subsidiaries described in more detail below as well as decreases in gains from the sale of Canary Wharf Group plc common stock ("Canary Wharf") of $30.0 million (after tax and minority interest) in 2001 as compared with $251.0 million in 2000. During the second quarter of 2001, CNA announced its intention to sell certain subsidiaries. The assets being held for disposition include the U.K. subsidiaries of CNA Re and certain other subsidiaries. Based upon the impairment analyses, CNA anticipated that it would realize losses in connection with those planned sales. In determining the anticipated loss from these sales, CNA estimated the net realizable value of each subsidiary being held for sale. An estimated realized loss of $278.4 million (after tax and minority interest) was initially recorded in the second quarter of 2001 in connection with these planned dispositions. CNA completed the sale of certain subsidiaries during the fourth quarter of 2001 and updated its impairment analyses of subsidiaries still held for sale, including the United Kingdom subsidiaries of CNA Re. The subsidiaries sold resulted in realized losses of $33.1 million (after tax and minority interest), all of which was previously recognized as part of the initial impairment loss recorded in the second quarter. The updated impairment analyses indicated that the $278.4 million realized loss (after tax and minority interest) recorded in the second quarter of 2001 should be reduced, primarily because the net assets of CNA Re U.K. had been significantly diminished by its operating losses in the second half of 2001. In addition, CNA updated its estimate of disposal costs, including anticipated capital contributions, to reflect changes in the planned structure of the anticipated sale. These updated impairment analyses reduced the realized loss by $153.4 million (after tax and minority interest), including $141.8 61 million related to the U.K. subsidiaries of CNA Re. The anticipated sale of the U.K. insurance subsidiaries will be subject to regulatory approval and all anticipated sales are expected to be completed in 2002. Net realized investment gains increased $482.0 million in 2000 as compared with 1999. This increase is related principally to realized gains from Global Crossing and Canary Wharf. The increase in net realized gains for 2000 as compared with 1999 was $149.0 million for Global Crossing and $182.0 million for Canary Wharf. Additionally, a favorable change in market conditions contributed to the results for the bond sector. A primary objective in the management of the fixed maturity portfolio is to maximize total return relative to underlying liabilities and respective liquidity needs. In achieving this goal, assets may be sold to take advantage of market conditions or other investment opportunities or credit and tax considerations. This activity will produce realized gains and losses. CNA classifies its fixed maturity securities (bonds and redeemable preferred stocks) and its equity securities as available for sale, and as such, they are carried at fair value. The amortized cost of fixed maturity securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, which are included in net investment income. Changes in fair value are reported as a component of other comprehensive income. Investments are written down to estimated fair value and losses are recognized in income when a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary. For asset backed securities included in fixed maturity securities, CNA recognizes income using a constant effective yield based on anticipated prepayments and the estimated economic life of the securities. When estimates of prepayments change, the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date and anticipated future payments. The net investment in the securities is adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been applied since the acquisition of the securities. Such adjustments are reflected in net investment income. Mortgage loans are carried at unpaid principal balances, including unamortized premium or discount. Real estate is carried at depreciated cost. Policy loans are carried at unpaid balances. Short term investments are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. Other invested assets include investments in limited partnerships and certain derivative securities. CNAs limited partnership investments are recorded at fair value and typically reflect a reporting lag of up to three months. Fair value represents CNAs equity in the partnerships net assets as determined by the General Partner. Limited partnerships are a small portion of CNAs overall investment portfolio. The majority of the limited partnerships invest in a substantial number of securities that are readily marketable. CNA is a passive investor and does not have influence over the management of these partnerships that operate according to established guidelines and strategies. These strategies may include the use of leverage and hedging techniques that potentially introduce more volatility and risk to the partnerships. Investments in derivative securities are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported as a component of realized gains or losses or other comprehensive income, depending on its hedge designation. 62 The following table details the carrying value of CNAs general and separate account investment portfolios as of the end of each of the last two years. General and Separate Account Investments December 31 2001 % 2000 % (In millions of dollars) General account investments Fixed maturity securities: Bonds: Taxable $26,396.0 74.0% $23,249.0 64.0% Tax exempt 2,720.0 8.0 3,349.0 9.0 Redeemable preferred stocks 48.0 54.0 Equity securities: Common stocks 996.0 3.0 2,216.0 6.0 Non redeemable preferred stocks 342.0 1.0 196.0 1.0 Mortgage loans and real estate 35.0 26.0 Policy loans 194.0 193.0 1.0 Other invested assets 1,355.0 4.0 1,116.0 3.0 Short term investments 3,740.0 10.0 5,660.0 16.0 Total general account investments $35,826.0 100.0% $36,059.0 100.0% Separate account investments Fixed maturity securities: Taxable bonds $2,347.0 62.0% $ 2,703.0 65.0% Equity securities: Common stocks 149.0 4.0 212.0 5.0 Non redeemable preferred stocks 12.0 3.0 Other invested assets 876.0 23.0 849.0 20.0 Short term investments 394.0 11.0 407.0 10.0 Total separate account investments $3,778.0 100.0% $4,174.0 100.0% Total separate accounts investments at fair value were approximately $3.7 and $4.1 billion at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, with taxable fixed maturities representing approximately 62.0% and 65.0% of the totals, respectively. Approximately 53.0% and 57.0% of separate accounts investments at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, are used to fund guaranteed investment contracts for which Continental Assurance Company and Valley Forge Life Insurance Company guarantee principal and a specified return to the contract holders (guaranteed investment contracts). The duration of fixed maturity securities included in the guaranteed investment contract portfolio is matched approximately with the corresponding payout pattern of the liabilities of the guaranteed investment contracts. CNAs investment policies for both the general and separate accounts portfolios emphasize high credit quality and diversification by industry, issuer and issue. Assets supporting interest rate sensitive liabilities are segmented within the general account to facilitate asset/liability duration management. The general account portfolio consists primarily of high quality (rated BBB or higher) bonds, 92.0% and 93.0% of which are rated as investment grade at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 63 The following table summarizes the ratings of CNAs general account fixed maturity bond portfolio at fair value: December 31 2001 2000 (In millions of dollars) U.S. government and affiliated agency securities $ 5,715.0 19.6% $ 8,689.0 32.7% Other AAA rated 9,204.0 31.6 7,120.0 26.8 AA and A rated 6,127.0 21.0 5,954.0 22.4 BBB rated 5,583.0 19.2 3,066.0 11.5 Below investment grade 2,487.0 8.6 1,769.0 6.6 Total $29,116.0 100.0% $26,598.0 100.0% The following table summarizes the bond ratings of the investments supporting CNAs separate accounts products which guarantee principal and a specified rate of interest: December 31 2001 2000 (In millions of dollars) U.S. government and affiliated agency securities $ 214.0 10.5% $ 224.0 9.8% Other AAA rated 1,017.0 49.9 1,248.0 54.5 AA and A rated 310.0 15.2 374.0 16.3 BBB rated 421.0 20.6 397.0 17.3 Below investment grade 77.0 3.8 49.0 2.1 Total $ 2,039.0 100.0% $ 2,292.0 100.0% At December 31, 2001 and 2000, approximately 98.0% of the general account bond portfolio, was U.S. government agency securities or was rated by Standard & Poors or Moodys Investors Service. Approximately 100.0% and 99.0% of the guaranteed investment contract portfolio bonds were U.S. government agency securities or were rated by S & P or Moodys Investors Service at December 31, 2001 and 2000. The remaining bonds were rated by other rating agencies, outside brokers or CNAs management. High yield securities are bonds rated as below investment grade (below BBB) by bond rating agencies and other unrated securities that, in the opinion of management, are below investment grade. High yield securities generally involve a greater degree of risk than investment grade securities. However, expected returns should compensate for the added risk. This risk is also considered in the interest rate assumptions in the underlying insurance products. CNAs concentration in high yield bonds was approximately 8.0% and 6.6% of the general account portfolio and 4.0% and 2.1% of the guaranteed investment contract portion of CNAs separate account bond portfolio as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Included in CNAs general account fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2001 are $7,723.0 million of asset backed securities, at fair value, consisting of approximately 69.0% in collateralized mortgage obligations ("CMOs"), 14.0% in corporate asset backed obligations, 13.0% in U.S. government agency issued pass through certificates, and 4.0% in corporate mortgage backed pass through certificates. The majority of CMOs held are actively traded in liquid markets and are priced by broker dealers. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, short term investments consisted primarily of commercial paper and money market funds. CNA invests in certain derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce its exposure to market risk (principally interest rate, equity price and foreign currency risk). CNA considers the derivatives in its general account to be held for purposes other than trading. Derivative securities are recorded at fair value at the reporting date. Most derivatives in separate accounts are held for hedging purposes. CNA uses these derivatives to mitigate market risk by purchasing Standard and Poors 500 index futures contracts in a notional amount equal to the contract liability relating to Life Operations Index 500 guaranteed investment contract product. 64 ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 142 changes the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives from an amortization method to an impairment only approach. Amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, including goodwill recorded in past business combinations, will cease upon adoption of SFAS No. 142, which for the Company will be January 1, 2002. The transition adjustment resulting from adoption must be reported in net income as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. In accordance with the transition guidance provided in SFAS No. 142, the Company is in the process of completing goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests that will be finalized by June 30, 2002. Amortization of goodwill and intangible assets amounted to $22.2, $27.2 and $30.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS No. 143 applies to the accounting and reporting obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. This Statement applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset, except for certain obligations of lessees. Adoption of this Statement is required for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. Adoption of these provisions will not have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the Company. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." SFAS No. 144 essentially applies one accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale, whether previously held and used or newly acquired, and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. Adoption of this Statement is required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Adoption of these provisions will not have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the Company. In 2002, the Company is required to implement the provisions of the FASBs Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 00 14, "Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives" and EITF Issue No. 00 25, "Vendor Income Statement Characterization of Consideration from a Vendor to a Retailer." EITF Issue No. 00 14 addresses the recognition, measurement, and income statement characterization of sales incentives, including rebates, coupons and free products or services, offered voluntarily by a vendor without charge to the customer that can be used in, or that are exercisable by a customer as a result of, a single exchange transaction. EITF Issue No. 00 25 addresses whether consideration from a vendor to a reseller of the vendors products is (i) an adjustment of the selling prices of the vendors products and, therefore, should be deducted from revenue when recognized in the vendors income statement or (ii) a cost incurred by the vendor for assets or services received from the reseller and, therefore, should be included as a cost or an expense when recognized in the vendors income statement. As a result of both issues, promotional expenses historically included in other operating expenses will be reclassified to cost of manufactured products sold, or as reductions of revenues from manufactured products. Prior period amounts will be reclassified for comparative purposes. Adoption of these provisions will not have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the Company. 65 FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements made or incorporated by reference by the Company in this Report are "forward looking" statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward looking statements include, without limitation, any statement that may project, indicate or imply future results, events, performance or achievements, and may contain the words "expect", "intend", "plan", "anticipate", "estimate", "believe", "will be", "will continue", "will likely result", and similar expressions. Statements in this report that contain forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding CNAs insurance business relating to asbestos, pollution and mass tort claims, expected cost savings and other results from restructuring activities; statements regarding insurance reserves and statements regarding planned disposition of certain businesses; statements regarding litigation and developments affecting Lorillards tobacco business including, among other things statements regarding claims, litigation and settlement, and statements regarding regulation of the industry; statements regarding Diamond Offshores business including, without limitation, statements with respect to expenditures for rig conversion and upgrade, and oil and gas price levels, exploration and production activity. Such statements inherently are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected. Such risks and uncertainties include, among others, the impact of competitive products, policies and pricing; product and policy availability and demand and market responses, including the effect of the absence of applicable terrorism legislation on coverages; development of claims and the effect on loss reserves; exposure to liabilities due to claims made by insured and others relating to asbestos remediation and health based asbestos impairments, and exposure to liabilities for environmental pollution and other mass tort claims; the sufficiency of CNAs loss reserves and the possibility of future increases in reserves; the performance of reinsurance companies under reinsurance contracts; the effects of the Enron bankruptcy on energy and capital markets, and on the markets for directors & officers and errors & omissions coverages; limitations upon CNAs ability to receive dividends from its insurance subsidiaries imposed by state regulatory agencies; regulatory limitations and restrictions upon CNA and its insurance subsidiaries generally; judicial decisions and rulings; the possibility of downgrades in CNAs ratings by ratings agencies and changes in rating agency policies and practices, and the results of financing efforts. The tobacco industry continues to be subject to health concerns relating to the use of tobacco products and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, legislation, including actual and potential excise tax increases, increasing marketing and regulatory restrictions, governmental regulation, privately imposed smoking restrictions, litigation, including risks associated with adverse jury and judicial determinations, courts reaching conclusions at variance with the general understandings of applicable law, bonding requirements and the absence of adequate appellate remedies to get timely relief from any of the foregoing, and the effects of price increases related to concluded tobacco litigation settlements and excise tax increases on consumption rates. In addition to the factors noted above, all aspects of the operations of the Company and its subsidiaries are affected by the impact of general economic and business conditions, changes in financial markets (interest rate, credit, currency, commodities and equities) or in the value of specific investments; changes in domestic and foreign political, social and economic conditions, the economic effects of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the impact of judicial rulings and jury verdicts, regulatory initiatives and compliance with governmental regulations and various other matters, many of which are beyond the control of the Company and its subsidiaries. Developments in any of these areas, which are more fully described elsewhere in this Report could cause the Companys results to differ materially from results that have been or may be anticipated or projected by or on behalf of the Company and its subsidiaries. These forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this Report. The Company expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in the Companys expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any statement is based. SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION The following supplemental condensed financial information reflects the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Loews Corporation with its investments in CNA and Diamond Offshore accounted for on an equity basis rather than as consolidated subsidiaries. It does not purport to present the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles because it does not comply with SFAS No. 94, "Consolidation of All Majority Owned Subsidiaries." Management believes, however, that this disaggregated financial data enhances an understanding of the consolidated financial statements by providing users with a format that management uses in assessing the Company. 66 Condensed Balance Sheet Information Loews Corporation and Subsidiaries (Including CNA and Diamond Offshore on the Equity Method) December 31 2001 2000 (In millions) Assets: Current assets $ 1,537.2 $ 579.7 Investments, primarily short term instruments 4,202.8 4,417.1 Total current assets and investments in securities 5,740.0 4,996.8 Investment in CNA 7,408.0 8,407.1 Investment in Diamond Offshore 1,033.5 975.8 Other assets 1,078.9 1,119.4 Total assets $15,260.4 $15,499.1 Liabilities and Shareholders Equity: Current liabilities $ 2,365.7 $ 1,543.3 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase 480.4 Long term debt, less current maturities and unamortized discount 2,427.6 2,450.8 Other liabilities 337.4 313.9 Total liabilities 5,611.1 4,308.0 Shareholders equity 9,649.3 11,191.1 Total liabilities and shareholders equity $15,260.4 $15,499.1 Condensed Statements of Operations Information Loews Corporation and Subsidiaries (Including CNA and Diamond Offshore on the Equity Method) Year Ended December 31 2001 2000 1999 (In millions) Revenues: Manufactured products and other $4,947.6 $4,751.5 $4,485.9 Investment income 199.1 258.5 198.1 Investment gains (losses) 101.2 (7.4) (461.7) Total 5,247.9 5,002.6 4,222.3 Expenses: Cost of manufactured products sold and other 3,890.9 3,593.5 3,374.0 Interest 136.6 140.3 143.4 Income tax expense 470.1 492.1 299.7 Total 4,497.6 4,225.9 3,817.1 Income from operations 750.3 776.7 405.2 Equity in (loss) income of: CNA (1,366.5) 1,068.0 43.2 Diamond Offshore 80.4 32.0 72.7 (Loss) income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles (535.8) 1,876.7 521.1 Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles net (53.3) (157.9) Net (loss) income $ (589.1) $1,876.7 $ 363.2 67 Condensed Statements of Cash Flow Information Loews Corporation and Subsidiaries (Including CNA and Diamond Offshore on the Equity Method) Year Ended December 31 2001 2000 1999 (In millions) Operating Activities: Net (loss) income $ (589.1) $1,876.7 $ 363.2 Adjustments to reconcile net (loss) income to net cash provided by operating activities: Undistributed loss (earnings) of CNA and Diamond Offshore 1,321.2 (1,064.9) (75.4) Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 53.3 157.9 Investment (gains) losses (101.2) 7.4 461.7 Other (48.5) 12.5 (23.8) Changes in assets and liabilities net 186.7 (88.0) (376.3) Total 822.4 743.7 507.3 Investing Activities: Net decrease in short term investments 243.6 193.2 242.9 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase 480.4 (347.8) (101.9) Purchases of CNA common stock (978.7) (107.0) Redemption of CNA preferred stock 200.0 Other (155.7) (198.1) (62.0) Total (410.4) (352.7) 172.0 Financing Activities: Dividends paid to shareholders (112.5) (99.7) (108.9) (Decrease) increase in long term debt net (18.2) 26.1 20.5 Purchases of treasury shares (282.2) (305.7) (601.6) Issuance of common stock .4 Total (412.5) (379.3) (690.0) Net change in cash (.5) 11.7 (10.7) Cash, beginning of year 21.6 9.9 20.6 Cash, end of year $ 21.1 $ 21.6 $ 9.9 68 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The Company is a large diversified financial services company. As such, it and its subsidiaries have significant amounts of financial instruments that involve market risk. The Companys measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of its financial instruments. Changes in the trading portfolio would be recognized as investment gains (losses) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Market risk exposure is presented for each class of financial instrument held by the Company at December 31, assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below. The Company believes that the various rates of adverse market movements represent a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions. The estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected actual loss, even under adverse conditions, because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ. In addition, since the Companys investment portfolio is subject to change based on its portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market, these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results which may occur. Exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by senior management. Senior management approves the overall investment strategy employed by the Company and has responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy and the level of risk acceptable to it. The Company may manage risk by buying or selling instruments or entering into offsetting positions. Equity Price Risk The Company has exposure to equity price risk as a result of its investment in equity securities and equity derivatives. Equity price risk results from changes in the level or volatility of equity prices which affect the value of equity securities or instruments that derive their value from such securities or indexes. Equity price risk was measured assuming an instantaneous 25% change in the underlying reference price or index from its level at December 31, 2001 and 2000, with all other variables held constant. Interest Rate Risk The Company has exposure to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates. The Company attempts to mitigate its exposure to interest rate risk by utilizing instruments such as interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, commitments to purchase securities, options, futures and forwards. The Company monitors its sensitivity to interest rate risk by evaluating the change in the value of its financial assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates. The evaluation is performed by applying an instantaneous change in interest rates by varying magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in rates would have on the recorded market value of the Companys investments and the resulting effect on shareholders equity. The analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value of the Companys financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices which the Company believes are reasonably possible over a one year period. The sensitivity analysis estimates the change in the market value of the Companys interest sensitive assets and liabilities that were held on December 31, 2001 and 2000 due to instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve of 100 basis points, with all other variables held constant. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Accordingly the analysis may not be indicative of, is not intended to provide, and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes of market interest rates on the Companys earnings or shareholders equity. Further, the computations do not contemplate any actions the Company could undertake in response to changes in interest rates. The Companys long term debt, including interest rate swap agreements, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 is denominated in U.S. Dollars. The Companys debt has been primarily issued at fixed rates, and as such, interest expense would not be impacted by interest rate shifts. The impact of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on fixed rate debt would result in a decrease in market value of $395.0 and $352.0 million, respectively. A 100 basis point decrease would result in an increase in market value of $464.6 and $398.8 million, respectively. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk Foreign exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments. The Company has foreign exchange rate exposure when it buys or sells foreign currencies or financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency. This exposure is mitigated by the Companys asset/liability matching strategy and through the use of futures for those instruments which are not matched. The Companys foreign transactions are primarily denominated in Canadian Dollars, British Pounds and the European Monetary Unit. The sensitivity analysis also assumes an instantaneous 20% change in the foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar from their levels at December 31, 2001 and 2000, with all other variables held constant. Commodity Price Risk The Company has exposure to commodity price risk as a result of its investments in gold options. Commodity price risk results from changes in the level or volatility of commodity prices that impact instruments which derive their value from such commodities. Commodity price risk was measured assuming an instantaneous change of 20% from their levels at December 31, 2001 and 2000. 69 The following tables present the Companys market risk by category (equity markets, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices) on the basis of those entered into for trading purposes and other than trading purposes. Trading portfolio: Category of risk exposure: Fair Value Asset (Liability) Market Risk December 31 2001 2000 2001 2000 (In millions) Equity markets (1): Equity securities $ 290.1 $ 248.2 $(73.0) $ (62.0) Options purchased 17.5 22.7 6.0 4.0 written (7.8) (17.5) (3.0) (3.0) Index futures long (2.0) short 1.0 Short sales (193.4) (201.1) 48.0 50.0 Separate accounts Equity securities (a) 11.7 2.7 (2.0) (1.0) Other invested assets 342.1 404.3 (6.0) (7.0) Interest rate (2): Options on government securities short (2.5) (2.0) Futures long (75.0) 17.0 short 16.0 (52.0) Separate accounts Fixed maturity securities 308.4 410.1 (5.0) 19.0 Gold Options (3) purchased 2.6 11.8 (3.0) (12.0) written (.4) Note: The calculation of estimated market risk exposure is based on assumed adverse changes in the underlying reference price or index of (1) a decrease in equity prices of 25%, (2) an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points at December 31, 2001 and a decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points at December 31, 2000 and (3) an increase in gold prices of 20%. Adverse changes on options which differ from those presented above would not necessarily result in a proportionate change to the estimated market risk exposure. (a) In addition, the Separate accounts carry positions in equity index futures. A decrease in equity prices of 25% would result in market risk amounting to $(217.0) and $(245.0) at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. This market risk would be offset by decreases in liabilities to customers under variable insurance contracts. Other than trading portfolio: Category of risk exposure: Fair Value Asset (Liability) Market Risk December 31 2001 2000 2001 2000 (In millions) Equity markets (1): Equity securities: General accounts (a) $1,338.4 $ 2,411.6 $ (322.0) $(456.0) Separate accounts 148.6 212.4 (37.0) (53.0) Other invested assets 1,306.9 1,333.0 (134.0) (112.0) Separate accounts Other invested assets 533.0 443.4 (133.0) (111.0) Interest rate (2): Fixed maturities (a) (b) 31,191.0 27,244.3 (1,560.0) (1,458.0) Short term investments (a) 6,734.8 10,037.4 (1.0) (4.0) Other derivative instruments 16.3 .7 (19.0) 1.0 Separate accounts (a): Fixed maturities 2,038.8 2,292.5 (120.0) (118.0) Short term investments 98.0 177.0 Long term debt (5,399.0) (5,747.0) Note: The calculation of estimated market risk exposure is based on assumed adverse changes in the underlying reference price or index of (1) a decrease in equity prices of 25% and (2) an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points. (a) Certain securities are denominated in foreign currencies. An assumed 20% decline in the underlying exchange rates would result in an aggregate foreign currency exchange rate risk of $(114.0) and $(581.0) at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. (b) Certain fixed maturities positions include options embedded in convertible debt securities. A decrease in underlying equity prices of 25% would result in market risk amounting to $(50.0) and $(56.0) at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 70
